you cannot convince me they are not paying people to give this terrible film high ratings on the internet people gave it 10 it is unwatchable i dont worry about foul language for the most part but a lot of effwords in a movie clearly targeted at 1012 yearold boys is a bit much it was just plain retarded from the getgo and the performances from the actors was not even remotely up to snuff and i love michael caine mark strong and colin firth  i figured how can you go wrong? i truly cant figure out who the audience is for this garbage total waste of $11 bucks wouldnt have even watched it free on the internetyes you read that header right thats how revolting i found this movie is this how women think nowadays? huh??? seriously??? is this how were going to start teaching women how to behave?? and what kind of a dumbass is neil patrick harris character for taking her back in?? gillian flynn clearly has fantasies about men being that stupid i mean really? what man would be stupid enough to take in a woman who fakes her own death? the phrase from the movie natural born killers comes to mind look bitch you knew i was a snake gillian flynn needs therapy because i can tell you all that this is not how marriage is supposed to be my mom and dad were married 21 years til death did they part and they yelled at each other twice and were rarely apart and loved each other dearly that is how a marriage is supposed to be dont believe this devil bitchs lies people if this is how women are going to start behaving i am never dating ever again as long as i live this movie and this nutjob who wrote this are proof positive its time for another flood gentlemen what we have here is a crazy bitchcedric the entertainerwow talk about the most misrepresented show on television arrow purports to be an actionadventure show about a superhero in reality it is as far from that as possible the movie annie has more action and adventure than arrow if this show has been recommended to you then i hope you are a fan of melodrama i call this show arrow 90210 taking out the commercials you are left with about 35 mins of tiresomely boring melodrama between the relatives and friends of arrow and about 5 mins of action i was really excited to watch this show i am a fan of the comic book and i liked the proposed changes to make the character more modern when i saw the pilot i thought it was interesting the whole subplot no spoilers in this review was intriguing and the show overall was interesting i did find the central character a bit lacking in the acting department is that guy a robot? have they updated his emotional responses yet? and the drama between the family and friends overly long and tiresome i still thought it had potential much to my chagrin the tiresome drama was quickly extended through each episode and the subplot and action downgraded accordingly by the fourth episode i was bored i turned it off i absolutely could not watch any further i found that i didnt care at all about the feelings or relationships of the characters and if the villain ever showed up dont blink or youll miss him i was rooting for him to winworst movie i have seen in ever and it goes one for over 2 and a half hours? it was awful there were many collective audience groans when i viewed this film and the endinghorrible i could have written a better piece of garbage i was unimpressed with ben afflecks plight but then i was amazed that i was even less interested in the flight of the gone girl and then to my horror i realized we had to suffer thru the whole part at the lake houseugh and then the stupid ending i seriously do not know how this was released in good faith i guess they just needed to try to get some money back for their effortsworst hero movie ever seen bad screenplay bad director worst director and actors  what can they do with such a director they suck james gunn play tetris for a 2014 move in my opinion its like a 1910 sf movie this movie want to be a parody $hit whatever but they hit a wall biiig time superhero never this movie sukcs biig time imdb should allow 0 for a score this is my score 0 from what i can see 20132014 in my opinion was the worst years for hollywood crappy scripts and crappier moviesworst 3 hours of my life it got to the end and i was still waiting for something to happen i would of had a more productive time watching grass grow dont waste your time watching this film i dont see the point in the film or what it was trying to achieve it went through a boys life that had no real significant moments in it the most outrageous thing he did was smoke a cigarette at 15 it was basically a film of a kids life that would not effect or inspire anybody he was a pessimist with no real goals in life he didnt go through any dramatic transformations or offer anything to the world he didnt achieve much it was a pointless film it was like the film was made to actually be as bad boring and ordinary as possible not one part of the film was embellished or interesting to sum it up an awful filmwith what seems like a million different versions of this classic fairytale you would think disney would go all out and make this one new and exciting but still keep the core parts the same however what you get is a very outdated movie with acting that is mediocre at best the only part i found interesting and enjoyable on film is when the fairy godmother played by helena carter shows up and does her thing turning the pumpkin into a carriage etc the animated version will always be the best but i dont think even young girls will be able to enjoy this just way too dull and it felt like an eternitywhy do we watch movies instead of living our dull boring lives? it is to give us momentary entertainment and allow us to dream of what we could accomplish if we are in the right circumstances and try hard enough boyhood is the gateway into the life of an average american boy showing us absolutely nothing basically the only good comment this movie receives is that it is similar to real life and gives you the chance to watch the actors grow throughout the movie that is it this movie attempts to do something risky that does not guarantee success but after all you cannot have a movie simply based on you know how everyones always saying seize the moment? i dont know im kind of thinking its the other way around you know like the moment seizes us for a movie to be successful you need a plot which the movie does not have good acting which only the father provides and originality not the portrayal of an average kid with a shitty life and no skills at all the only good thing you can see from this movie is the actors growing up and for that you might as well see harry potter and so it is with the utmost sincerity that i recommend you watch all 8 harry potter films and receive the entertainment you deservewhere to start? this movie is so flawed it is difficult to know which aspect deserves more blame first the music is actually very annoying repetitive and grandiloquent it gets on the nerve of the listener especially after the first two hours second the characters are completely flat and uninteresting their emotions feel mechanical and the bad characters simply act erratically as a function of the need of the story third the dialogs are full of platitudes love cannot be measured says the astrophysicist or outright absurdity gravity can travel through time and become laughable at times the worst is clearly the scenario in addition to marx brothers physics relativistic effects without relativistic velocity 300m high tides on a planet with 20 cm of water goofy space exploration you land first and then you start thinking about what kind of planet it is the plot spirals into such a pile of nonsense that it is difficult not to feel insulted apparently a good physicist was hired to provide the visuals for the black hole it would have been also good to hire a scenarist that can write a storywhere to start this isnt anything to do with sleeping beauty apart from the names even then the three good fairies names change who are knotgrass thistlewit and flittle? shouldnt it be flora fauna and merryweather whats the point in changing the names it adds to the complete difference between sleeping beauty and maleficent since when did maleficent see aurora everyday in sleeping beauty she sends her warthog things to find aurora but they have been looking in cradles for 16 years so she sends her ravencrow to find aurora however in maleficent they become really good friends and maleficent wants aurora to stay with her what?? some if this is from the book i read so im blaming the book as well here since when did the queen die? at the end of sleeping beauty it pictures her with stefan while phillip and aurora dance happy ending in maleficent auroras parents both die wow and its not like disney to suffocate someone as in stefan and king henry and making the ravencrow be the dragon totally takes it away from maleficent that was a main part in the story in sleeping beauty but now its a meh moment seriously quit while your ahead frozen was amazing so disney should have waited a but to find new ideas not just launch into another movie which a lot of people seem to dislike for the same reasons thus film takes it away from frozen i could honestly go on but it would take all day to point out the flaws in the book and the film the storyline is what makes a storyfilm yeah characters are important but if the story is untrue and totally contradicts itself how can the actors look good films have to make actors look good maleficent doesnt im usually a massive fan of disney but whoever wrote this needs to watch sleeping beauty againwhen i want to watch a movie i want to watch something exciting something attracting and at least not a waste of time this movie was obviously way too boring firstly it was way ahead then its times even ahead then star trek and its voyages coming to reality jhonny d is one brilliant actor when ever his movies are out he character and role is not only challenging but different this time it was ridiculous i dont know but i believe he would worked only for a matter a few minutes while working for the entire movie rest of the cast is brilliant but perhaps they are also deceive by the script i agree script is new completely futuristic and fascinating but the way they are adapted it and put it up on the screen was too boring there are scenes of action some really freaky stuff too but its not exciting its not attracting you to watch it again and again its too predictable you can not only guess the next scene but even the dialogues in short its a horrible movie to watch i was 110% bored while watching it but then again if you are a johnny d fan and nothing else to do in life then watch itwhen i started to watch the show i really didnt like the regular story from the past insertions but sadly after more and more episodes those became actually far more interesting that the main story then i stopped watching it really felt that i can just watch any episode in any order and i wouldnt even know if i had seen it or not it was all so cookie cutter the main character is not bad but then it goes pretty down from there now i realize that the entire series was written by a bunch of 12 y o during their summer break there can be no other explanation for the mind bogglingly inane plot that tries to carry this series through pap is too good a word for this garbage when i saw this was directed by chris nolan i said theres no way i can miss this movie then i checked out the ratings on imdb and went running to the theater only to be put to sleep this movie was supposed to take place a few centuries into the future however when cooper goes to his daughters school for the parent teacher conference there is a tube tv in the classroom huh? tube tvs cant be found anywhere in 2014 yet were expected to believe they exist 200 years in the future also what was the point of cooper and the kids following that drone? they made a huge climatic event and then the drone crashes and thats it ok so whats the point going through the worm hole was ok but the other planets that were visited looked down right fantastical like out of a disney fairytale this film was filled with a listers but fell flat matt damons character was totally predictable and so was the ending i really dont understand the appeal and high ratingswhen i saw the trailer i didnt think this film would be anything special a few weeks later a friend of mine who shared the same opinion at first told me it was awesome after watching it since then i held my expectations high but i was greatly disappointed to be honest i dont even know where to start the film is a huge clich overall and a ridiculous mess starting with the characters and the actors that give them life we have great names in the industry which of course grants the film some status still my only thought about this was what the hell are you guys doing in this film? seriously? renowned actors mixed with bad acting and pseudofunny acting which doesnt turn out to be funny isnt exactly the perfect recipe i dont dislike zoe saldana but the roles she takes are more or less the same and she doesnt even bother to work on different mannerisms or whatsoever to create an interesting performance to provide her character some individuality most of the plot holes if not all of them are found in the main characters whose ambitions change like the wind and without making any sense one minute gamora was trying to kill peter quill and five minutes later quill was saving her because hes that good just like they are best friends forever after that the love interest feels so so forced becauseÑ plot thankfully we dont get to see them kissing or whatever otherwise that would be a bigger face palm the background stories are boring with no consistence and so clich theres nothing new about them in gamoras case we step onto mary sues grounds the usual wannabe badass whos actually just a damaged girl who suffered a lot in the past not to speak about stupid lines which you wouldnt even see in filmsÑ oh and of course talking about footloose and a lizard fight to extend the length of the film i couldnt feel any empathy or whatsoever for these characters so that means they are doing it wrongÑ the sentimental scenes meant nothing and i couldnt care less if they died actually scratch that if they died i could have left the cinema earlier everything is a huge clich frames scenes charactersÑ it almost feels like youre watching a collage and you know exactly whats going to happen every single time this film doesnt surprise you in any way the soundtrack was terribly chosen it gives the impression that they just chose a couple of songs they like and said lets use it even though it doesnt fit moreover and if im right its not supposed to fit its supposed to contrast with the scenes to make it funny it wasnt thats where it gets ridiculous if this film is supposed to be a parody its not funny at all if its supposed to be taken seriously it fails miserably it did manage to make me and my friend laugh in the final scenes at the absurdity of it all not everything is that bad though truth be said the film has excellent special effects and that is the only reason im giving it two stars im pretty sure most people get stunned with the effects and think its great rocket was somehow nice and groot was the one i sympathized more with even though he said the same line over and over for me a film has to tell a story even if doesnt follow convention at the very least it has to express something like every kind of art im tired of going to the cinema and watching the same plot over and over without any consistence of watching films that are 90% explosions cities being destroyed and so on and 10% plot i just felt dumber after watching this its called mass stupidificationwhen i saw the trailer i didnt think this film would be anything special a few weeks later a friend of mine who shared the same

main difference between divergent and insurgent you ask? with divergent i got to heckle at the screen to my hearts content and shout profanities because i was in the comfort of my own home with insurgent i was bound to socially acceptable behavior since it was a free advance screening in a theater when i say this is a bad series i truly mean that there is nothing worthwhile to be taken away from either movie the 2nd installment continues the overly convoluted and utterly senseless plot that pits our heroine tris shailene woodley against a poorly defined villain and conflict she is even less believable as the brave toughasnails caste member shes been so effortlessly been trying to become and then suddenly she exhibits all the other redeemable qualities that defines her as divergent? and i thought twilight was awful this second installment centers aroundwell nothing in particular it basically picks up where the first one left off and tris and company have to get back at the jeanine  the out of place cartoon villain theres some magical box thats introduced as the macguffin device which ultimately unravels the already fragmented narrative dont worry the sequel adds a whole new level of plotholes to the already ridiculous premise gee all that futuristic tech that wasnt in the first film looks awfully familiar to another teengirlturned heroine young adult series characters? development? dont be preposterous those things dont exist in this movie just like the first film you have painfully delivered dialogue that is more laughable than memorable that forced romance from the first one? yeah youre just supposed to accept it in this one sorry four youre stuck with her for better or for worse honestly the only redeemable part of this hackneyed and clichd movie is miles tellers character hes seldom on screen and is only funny because he plays a total jerk lets hope no one notices that theyre borrowing a lot of elements from other classic and popular dystopian stories logans run? thats about a marathon right? nope there are no isolated societies in divergentinsurgent hunger games? no this is a movie about an impractical futuristic society that segments parts society for the greater good you must be mistaken oh wait i made it through two and a half pitchers of beer only drinking when there was something generally cringeworthy on screen see if you can beat my record drinking responsibly and in remedy of this movie of course  the best part of the sequel? its 20 minutes shorter than divergent read the full review and others like it on the

full review and others like it on the drivein zeppelin websitewhat is the problem with hollywood and infatuation with british accent one can hardly understand most of the movie angelina pretends to have the accent the three fairies hardly can speak english and the main guy character was so hard to understand that i walked off the movie please announce if you are going to use british accent in movies so many of us would not waste hard earned $$ the movie is predictable the director has spoiled angelinas beauty and there was nothing in the movie that kept my interest we watched the movie in 3d and that is even more waste of money as there were no great special effects worth watching in 3dwhat could have been an engaging cross between james bond and marvel comics is marred by misplaced vulgarity overthetop gore and the ineptitude of samuel l jackson the premise of twentysomethings vying for a spot in a secret society of british super agents is promising but the storyline moves disjointedly between comedyadventure and pulp fictionlike violence colin firth shines as the veteran kingsman and taron egerton and sophie cookson are fine as kingsman candidates but jackson is a lame villain who doesnt have the charm or acting chops to fill his role a movie like this needs a hans gruber and jackson is no alan rickman kingsman the secret service is a good idea with the right script and a compelling villain it could have been much betterwhat can i say about this movie that would be positive in some way or form? not much really except for a good performance by rebecca hall as the wife of lead johnny depp i really do not see many redeeming qualities to this film it completely fails at even holding my attention for its full length i will spare you the story since frankly i really do not have the strength or desire to reiterate it to anyone just after having watched the film in its entirety transcendence will leave you with a sensation of pointlessness incomprehension and a complete lack of sympathy for its creators if you are a fan of johnny depp and you think he is so dreamy but dont care much about his acting abilities then this movie is for you on the other hand if you are looking for a good movie with a sound plot and solid character development then steer clear of this disaster of a movie called transcendence you would be happy you didwhat can i say about this film the hype was there very topical a director with an amazing eye all start cast the film should have been very good all round but sadly it is far from it the plot is weak acting poor and the dumbing down of the science has actually led to a film which makes little or no sense who is the audience suppose to connect with? maybe the annoying wife the dead scientist in a computer the annoying friend or the terrible cast of sub characters who all have no substance or any kind of interesting back story if your doing science fiction based around such an interesting and real concept please show some respect to the intelligence of your target audience utter rubbishwhat can be said? the reviewers who love this movie are entitled to their opinion of course but dont trust them this movie is god awful only because of the critical reviews and my girlfriend wanting to see it plus the rent one get one free coupon from hastings did it ever come into my dvd player and if ever a premonition of a terrible movie came true it was with this tripe where to start there is no plot but this is just life you say yeah and if i dont want to be entertained for the evening i will not rent a movie i will just stare at myself in the mirror and otherwise watch another day go by but they followed this kid around for thirteen years or some such bs as that did they? who casted his parents? who scripted his lines what a hoax this movie is so bad that when i returned it to the video store this evening and demanded my money back the staff in unison asked did you watch boyhood? we are so sorry this movie is so bad that it inspired my first ever review on this site wow i could go onwhat a silly movie this isÑ creepy yuppie couple nick and amy live unhappily in the middle of american nowhere for petty reasons amy turns nasty on nick and plan the most incredible and farfetched disappearance act ever seen on screen in fact amy turns into a psychocrazy criminal mastermind committing several acts of violence on herself and others all graphically shown in the movie i guess this is the reason why the rating of gone girl is still so high it does not happen often to see a blond beautiful angelic young woman doing what amy does it is a sort of moralporn of female debasement the plot is wrapped up by one of the sloppiest police investigations ever and by amy and nick deciding to stay unhappily together for reasons impossible to understand just like the rest of the moviewhat a silly movie this is€ creepy yuppie couple nick and amy live unhappily in the middle of american

no sense at all and i couldnt care less about any of the characters the acting was good but the characters were just emptylacking empathy fincher could have killed them all at the same time would make no difference and my god those police officers where incompetent a five year old child would be able to see that there was something wrong straight away she was supposedly assaulted and kidnapped people notice an open door but no one saw her leaving or someone getting inside the house even better drag a person outside put the person in the car in plain day light the amount of blood that she extracted from her body in such a short period would lead her to faint but no she had the energy to clean the place and drive for hours she claimed that she was pregnant and she had analysis to prove from someone else urine even is she had suffered an abortion a few medical investigations would show the reality she claimed she was raped once used the exactly same method a second time and no one thought  wait this is a little bizarre left her place looking exactly the same and no one saw her even with her face all over the news i have no words just horriblewhat a huge pile of steaming poop i could not believe that the movie critics gave this horrible movie a 92 rating the movie is slow as hell the characters are so badly developed that you never care for them good actors play characters that appear in the movie juts to be disposed off soon after the special effects are pretty weak you see the spaceship vibrating all the time but the faces of the actors are not reflecting the shaking or the gravitational pulls but of course they make lots of ugly faces you should see the movie stealth to learn a thing or two about this kind of special effects the robot is the most ridiculous thing in the movie the plot is just so far fetched that i caught myself smiling at times who let the writer into the cutting room? 3 hours are you serious? only an unabashed christopher nolan fanboy would have the courage to claim to have found any redeeming quality on this practical joke $20000000000 us dollars what a waistwent to see this in the cinema after the good reviews from imdb and my friends some of whom went to see it twice what a disappointment it didnt appeal on any level it was a complete pile of groot humour was limited and shallow plot gossamer thin and the action was not really worth the effort on the whole its not as if i took the film seriously either i really enjoyed the ludicrous lucy despite its numerous flaws surely i cant be the only one who didnt like this film? if it had been directed by uwe boll it couldnt have been much worse if i never see it again i will be ok glad i didnt waste more time and money watching it in an imax a 12 inch portable black and white would sufficewell well well was this some kind of amateur demo reel? i claim the very dubious honour of having watched thisermovie twice once with a friend and her kids and again with my 14 year old of course its a stinker but then many movies that managed to attain cult status have been worse stinkers than this one the birdpeople for example one method whereby movies rise to cult level is by negative recommendation people tell friends how bad it is and the friends watch it to see why and ive certainly noticed a whole lot of negative comments regarding this movie for a long time twilight was regaled as the worse series ever made i and many of my acquaintances watched it just to see why it got that reputation twilight now enjoys a modest cult following another contributing factor is unintentional humour my second viewing of this movie had me chuckling at lavagirls shoddy makeover and at some of the tacked in nonsense to show off the 3d effect sharkboy throwing a glass of water toward the audience during his dance routine for example sometimes deviating radically from the norm can project a film into the realm of cult status also this movie while not engaging in major deviation still has enough tedium about it to give it a little push away that direction who knows perhaps in the future droves of teenagers and maybe adults too will throng to theatres late at night 3d glasses in hand garbage that makes this look halfway decentas they do now for the rocky horror picture show right now the future looks grim for this oddity but i would certainly not be surprised to see it pop up out of nowhere sometime down the roadwell well well thanks a lot for spoiling 150 minutes of my life i still dont understand why this film is so highly rated i guess i should not believe in ratings of imdb anymore  please dont watch this trash its such a waste of time a girl  to avenge the betrayal gets hold of her husband by planting a successful crime scene that can happen only in movies and that girl ends up patching up with him again if this all had to happen then what was the fun of making that dirt of 150 mints so awful ending those who rated it 10 must be banned for further rating the most disgusting movie i have seen in my life and yes what happened to police in the end  they knew she was criminal but they couldnt do anything wow u think we are buffoons  get a life mr director and please dont breed regardswell well  hearing angelina jolie utter those words had me excited maleficent is a sight to behold shes tall menacing strong and subtly powerful alas

latest in the line of postwicked take on stories where the villain gets the chance to reveal the motivation behind their actions except this isnt maleficents account of sleeping beauty  this is a completely different tale and frankly a tale i dont care for the film ticks off its mandatory checklist spinning wheel  check spoilers ahead in a shockingly emotional turn of events the film successfully gives maleficent reason for her villainy the film treads an unexpected and onpoint metaphor for rape which catapults us into that iconic christening scene from the animated film jolie is perfect in these scenes maleficents curse is delivered with strength gusto and conviction but this conviction for the original tale doesnt last long enough after comfortably placing the audience within the context of sleeping beauty the film sharply deviates from its source and leaves the audience stranded three fairies  check why tarnish what we loved so dearly? disneys three endearing fairies flora fauna and merryweather are replaced by ridiculously unfunny pixies knotgrass flittle and thistlewit theyre weak stupid and mean who would have thought aurora was entrusted to these three for protection? the three pixies dont care for the baby and so instead of searching for 16 years for the one she cursed maleficent finds herself watching over aurora elle fanning as her reluctant fairy godmother scratching your head yet? true loves kiss  check the film wastes too much time showing fairies slapping one another yes its that variety of comedy to properly set up the love story between prince phillip and aurora the writers think it suitable to set up a surprise ending whereby phillips kiss does not work in awakening the princess i dont have to reveal who does wake the sleeping beauty but its a cheap resolution that has become a new clich so in an misguided effort in juggling the roles of the characters maleficent has ended up being terribly muddled most notably the pixies and king stefan who after not seeing his daughter for 16 years banishes her to her bedroom with not so much as an hello before acting out violently against one said pixie jolie and fanning do well with what theyre given but what is given is not what was wanted where is the evil maleficent we loved? all that is left with an illjudged feminist romance maleficent is an adult film correctly rated m for its themes and violence that has childish characters that could only appeal to fouryearolds it is indeed a sleeping beauty  a visually superb film that failed to awake to the possibilities

maleficents curse is delivered with strength gusto and conviction but this conviction for the original tale doesnt last long enough after comfortably placing the audience within the context of sleeping beauty the film sharply deviates from its source and leaves the audience stranded three fairies  check why tarnish what we loved so dearly? disneys three endearing fairies flora fauna and merryweather are replaced by ridiculously unfunny pixies knotgrass flittle and thistlewit theyre weak stupid and mean who would have thought aurora was entrusted to these three for protection? the three pixies dont care for the baby and so instead of searching for 16 years for the one she cursed maleficent finds herself watching over aurora elle fanning as her reluctant fairy godmother scratching your head yet? true loves kiss  check the film wastes too much time showing fairies slapping one another yes its that variety of comedy to properly set up the love story between prince phillip and aurora the writers think it suitable to set up a surprise ending whereby phillips kiss does not work in awakening the princess i dont have to reveal who does wake the sleeping beauty but its a cheap resolution that has become a new clich_ so in an misguided effort in juggling the roles of the characters maleficent has ended up being terribly muddled most notably the pixies and king stefan who after not seeing his daughter for 16 years banishes her to her bedroom with not so much as an hello before acting out violently against one said pixie jolie and fanning do well with what theyre given but what is given is not what was wanted where is the evil maleficent we loved? all that is left with an illjudged feminist romance maleficent is an adult film correctly rated m for its themes and violence that has childish characters that could only appeal to fouryearolds it is indeed a sleeping beauty  a visually superb film that failed to awake to the possibilities of what it could have beenwell this was a waste if youve seen the 1992 film the lawnmower man then youve seen a better version of transcendence thats right  jeff fahey outdid johnny depp if youve never seen that movie then you might say this film starts out with a relatively interesting concept however it ends in a twist that doesnt really make any sense based on the actions of the characters in the preceding 115 minutes of the film not one of the characters is interesting or likable the pace of the film dragged and all the members of my party seemed to be waiting eagerly for the film to be over dont waste your time or moneywell theres no chance of letting any spoilers slip because i only made it about 30 minutes in before giving up i can start by saying that i was not a fan of the original series so im not comparing it to anything i just didnt like it i found it very loud and confusing way too intricate and convoluted plotwise i didnt care about any of the characters thats usually the test i give a movie just before i turn it off in the middle how would i feel if all these characters died in the very next scene? if the answer is that i wouldnt care one bit i go ahead and turn it off which is what i did here the three stars are for the special effects which looked pretty good but werent enough to keep me interested for two hours not saying it was a bad movie just saying i didnt like itwell thats 90 minutes of my life ill never get back angelina jolie does her best impression of sucking a lemon as she wanders aimlessly through a plot written on the back of a fag packet the end oh but imdb requires more okay so i wanted to put the princess to sleep permanently  with a hatchet talk about saccharine performance all the secondary characters are pants absolutely no explanation as to why king stefan betrayed his childhood sweetheart for the crown? just like a man thener not utterly built around the lead actress no one else to compete and shes not all that not even close in a wordcrapwell it is interesting for sure to see reviews for this film at the extreme ends either loving or hating i like to watch movies but i am not like some who seem to be students of film i didnt know going in that interstellar would be nearly three hours or that nolan had directed the film i hated inception also i have a bit of a problem when people always bring up the science in a science fiction film it is in fact fiction however interstellar was just dreadful the first hour they were on a farm in the middle of who knows where nothing was established how long had it been since cooper had flown what was his involvement in his previous career? how did the world get to like it was portrayed in this movie? also i had a problem with the premise that mankind was never meant to stay on earth what? then cooper is asked to fly a mission and doesnt even have time to reacquaint with current technology but he can dock a ship while spinning at over 50 miles an hour hmmm like others said there is no character development so you dont care about these people the dialog also had a lot of problems i was angry when i walked out i couldnt leave early because i was with someone ugh what a waste of time and moneywe were expecting a new perspective like maleficent huge disappointment we should have realized from the trailers but thats what we get for assuming disney was starting a reboot trend i cant believe my wife leaned over half way through the movie and said im ready to go when you are we were not expecting gore and dismay but we were hoping for a fresh perspective other than adding more footage of the animals if your kids or you have never seen a cinderella movie then its great if youre tired of movies being remade every few years then this is not for you the actors did an amazing job with this rendition however im tired of seeing the same movie over and over with new actors id imagine that its like being a drama teacher in high school first time seeing cinderella = 8 oh nice job cinderella again? = 3 what was disney thinking? so yes the fact that a company needs a revenue income provided by a script that they dusted off from the shelf will flock people to the box office caught us hook line and sinkerwatching boyhood there was nothing to keep me interested i like slow movies in general but if a movie is not exciting it should have interesting characters or good acting or clever writing or perceptive ideas or an intriguing atmosphere or beautiful cinematography or emotional scenes or at the very least make the viewer feel like they are in good company boyhood has none of that it feels long and boring the acting is very wooden the lead seems to have an extremely limited emotional range he can play vaguely amused to mildly irritated and thats about it he even seems to get worse as an actor as he gets older theres no character progression for the main people the lead starts off as a lazy boy and grows into a lazy adult his parents change a bit i suppose but not in a hugely insightful way his dad starts off a transient and ends up settling down inspirational his mom apparently needs a masters degree in order to get a job and begins and ends her scenes in the movie in fits of unhappiness how is she going to find meaning in her life? no one really cares did anyone actually write a script for this film? i know that it supposed to be like real life man but even then it fails two drunken stepfathers? isnt one enough? that mexican guy who because of one patronizing remark from the mom suddenly becomes the manager of a fancy restaurant? even the main guy looked unconvinced in that scene real life has bumps and curve balls dark nights of the soul and moments of extreme beauty and joy in real life people have to deal with hard choices and other people tell stories about these choices called movies with little things called plots and character arcs a deliberately mundane film like boyhood demeans the whole art form of filmmaking whats even scarier is that most people like itwatched gone girl last night  absolute pile of garbage odd film that doesnt know what it is tries to be a parody of the modern world where the media subverts any notion of the truth but the characters are nowhere near defined enough and so we never buy in to it well i certainly didnt no real development behind the break up of the couples relationship  one minute theyre having sex in a bookshop next thing hes lost his job and they hate each other silly things like the way the pike character drops her hidden money during the crazy golf scene the way she eats a lot and dyes her hair but still looks like the absent wife and the jelly baby scene with the lawyer very contrived  worst case of plot manipulation since crash as for pikes certain oscar nomination its a really bad version of glenn closes routine from fatal attraction blank expression and the odd violent outburst does not an oscar performance make best bit in the film was the mistress breasts which were a major highlight considering the dullness of the movie  to quote the pike character the girl with the giant cumonme tits very astute shame fincher wasnt as perspicaciouswatched 2001 space od instead how can this film get a higher score on imdb than a classic proper sci film and not some family drama stretched out and a bit of futuristic spice i can only think this gets such a high rating due to viewers not seeing old films and being won over by modern day bandwagons to jump on also the lead character is so wooden he acts like a 2 by 4 and he mumbles his stiffly delivered bits this would not matter in a proper scifi film but here in this melodrama masquerade it does matter or really it doesnt matter this is over rated tripewas almost not going to give this movie a pass having a feeling that it was going to be a bloated mess and oh my what a bloated drawn out rudderless and boring bloated mess it was i have never felt like walking out of the cinema while watching a movie but at the half way point of this film i was tempted it was that bad the story was a meandering affair not really going anywhere from start to finish with nonsensical and clich_ dross thrown in for good measure it didnt feel like a scifi more like a soppy drama with a few scifi elements thrown in and the special fx where nothing special a few ok scenes but for the most part it was bland bland bland i thought it was going to be an innovative trippy kubrikesque like film with a lot of bizarre and amazing visuals and strange and unique vistas and scenes aliens strange technologies otherwordly gods instead it boiled down to a silly soap opera with bickering astronauts and crying family members avoidwarning this tvseries may cotain the worst scenes and acting you have ever seen on screen your whole life consider yourself warned i have tortured myself through the first season and ended at the third episode in season 2 arrow is so bad that i would either cut my dick off tape it to my forehead and walk around like an unicorn a whole day than see another episode they copypaste batman the acting is terrible the script is toilet paper the only good thing is the sexiness of laurel katie cassidy how on mother earth did this series got 82 in rating? it is only 03 behind homeland and 05 behind modern family please god cancel this show for the sake of the human race  stayzorvery simple very short the movie is a complete drama i saw the trailers and all of them made the movie appear to be scientific but it is just confusing and filled with speculation i really am getting annoyed with how new movies are all starting to pretend that man is something more like lucy all are disappointing movies and the only parts i really enjoyed was when they showed space like the last few minutes of lucy and the few minutes in interstellar showing the wormholeblackhole etc why do you insist on turning movies into an art? all those who said this movie was great your reviews are really confusing to me how can this be a masterpiece when 95% of the movie was complete drama and a waste of time? if you will make a movie called interstellar i expect to see a 25 hour movie filled with speculation and knowledge about things such as a singularity or a blackhole why waste time talking and docking and other things? just zoom out and let us stare at the blackhole that is the sole reason i watched this movie and the sole reason i created an account here next time change it to dramacomplete drama dont take a name like interstellar and make it into complete nonsense we want to see science we want to see you analyze the blackhole and the wormhole completely low budget stuff were put in this film docking looked fake by the way i am extremely outraged at how fake this movie seemed thank youupon seeing the trailer for insurgent i knew straight away the film will be different from the book and i was okay with it if i had known just how much did they butcher the book there would not have been a power on earth strong enough to make me cough up the money for the ticket i cannot even begin to list everything wrong with this movie but i will do my best to point out the highlights the performances there is a reason why i gave 3 stars one is for miles teller he is the only bright spot in the entire mess he is witty funny quick and sharp the other star is for shailene woodley her performance was nowhere near to what she is capable of but i think she did the best she could with the little she got the rest of the cast was a nightmare theo james was so wooden he might just as well not be in the movie at all octavia spencer did not get enough space to introduce herself properly let alone show off her talent and whoever cast naomi watts must have been drunk out of his senses she is a decent actress but she looked like fours ex wife not his mother even kate winslet was repetitive and uninteresting the writers made both jeanine and evelyn into onedimensional clichs and took away anything interesting about them the story the person who wrote the script clearly holds no respect for the authors work or the fans there are whole scenes that were not in the book and the scenes and dialogues crucial for both the plot and character development are not altered  they are missing altogether you cannot even recognise tris from the book her feeling of guilt is spoken of to the point where it bothers you because she becomes whiny and selfabsorbed yet she runs around firing a gun at anything that moves she is presented as the typical chosen one you have seen a thousand times before and there is nothing original about her journey anymore the only thing i have to applaud are the effects the reason for the third star they are truly stunning even though the are deliberately paraded in the scenes that are made out of extremely thin air the use of special effects is a tricky thing if the story is great you do not need a lot of them just enough to create the environment and underline the story however if there is such a severe lack of originality in the screenplay as you can observe here you notice the precise amount and nature of visual wonders and yet they do nothing to improve the overall impression which in this case is that i could have been doing literally anything else and it would not have been such a huge waste of time i do not normally post reviews because they reflect my own opinion but in this case i felt obliged to save someone the pain of seeing their beloved book torn to pieces and prostituted for profit seriously save yourself the pain i cannot so i am hoping for amnesiaupon seeing the trailer for insurgent i knew straight away the film will be different from the book and

on making liveaction reimaginings of many of their classic animated films i rolled my eyes and thought why would they waste their resources telling us stories that we already know? considering some of the really smart and creative animated films that theyve turned out in the past decade such as tangled 2010 and wreckitralph 2012 it seems like they should be working on more of those on top of that i was quite disappointed with last years spinoff of sleeping beauty maleficent so when i heard that they were indeed planning to keep the trend going with cinderella i was like and so it continues *sigh* however when the trailer came out except for some obvious overthetop cgi effects it didnt look too bad so i decided to make the trip to the theatre yesterday and see it whats the final verdict? well apart from some quite nicelooking sets and costumes disney has once again made another cgiladen cashgrab where its obvious they spent more time and money on how the film looks rather than how the story is executed it seems pointless to summarize the story seeing as its one everybody knows so ill just get right to talking about where the film falls flat its biggest flaw is that while its clear that the writers tried to give some development to the characters by extending their roles andor giving them more interaction with each other but none of it ever lasts for more than a few minutes for example they have cinderella and the prince meet in the forest before the ball in order to try and give them some believable chemistry but the conversation they have only lasts for about ten minutes so it comes off as rather odd when the prince is raving about her and insisting that she come to the ball the next scene similarly we get a subplot near the end that involves the wicked stepmother making a deal with the grand duke that if he keeps quiet about cinderella and raises both her and her daughters statuses she will reward him however the duke almost never speaks in any of his previous scenes so we never get any indication as to why he would betray the prince as he does also there is something that happens near the end of the film which i will not reveal in case you havent seen the movie but its something major that comes completely out of left field and doesnt move the plot forward in any way so its completely pointless the movie also fails in how it constantly tries to show off the lavishlydecorated sets and expensive cgi effects at every turn while they do look nice as i already said they often shove their cgi creatures right into the camera and even have some shots where they zoom in on specific pieces of the set when really they should be focusing on the characters cinderella has really turned me off to all future liveaction reimaginings that disney may come out with if i have to ill get down on my hands and knees and say please please pleeeeease go back to making original content againtrying to remember this is public series started as u would expectand just went downwards there is so much to put the finger onso im just gonna stick to season 3 whats came out anyway question 1 why does oliver arrow behave like hes the only one that have been hurtcan cope with it? 2 why does oliverarrow still mean and enforce that im gonna spare his life no matter whateven though that very same person is responsible for the deaths of several thousand people that we know of in the seriesbut hey he got to make out++ with a few girls before they diedso conclusion series started out promisingbut hollywood decided to please people to much againmaking it to a lovestory and marvelheroes aint made for such thing truly one of the most ludicrous films ever made virtually every moment of the film comprises a series of linked premises without any one of them having a rational basis the film depends upon multiple concepts regarding spacetime and space travel most of which the audience is sufficiently familiar with to appreciate the potential story  but  each one of those is then formulated and entered into the storyline in a way that you cannot suspend belief the series of presumptions just accumulate one ludicrous outcome after another just in time to be posted straight into another ludicrous presumption so what builds is a stack of preposterous situations that can really only be resolved by yet another even more ludicrous outcome this causes the late stages of the film to become so disjointed that the basic premise collapses note that the suspension of belief is of course fundamental to many films  in star trek for example one suspends belief in accepting that faster than light travel is possible  or falling asleep inside your own dreams is believable as in inception  and thats aok because the rest of the action is consistent however the number of presumptions you have swallow in interstellar that have no basis in science fiction or reality strains credulity way past breaking point one at least has to see a consistency for a film to be acceptable notwithstanding these comments the individual elements are each highly watchable and nolan does his usual blinding literally in couple of the shots best the environments and space scenes are quite breathtaking however watching the film is a cascaded cataclysm of ideas concepts halftheories impossibilities broken linkages and downright wrongness that appears on the screen like confetti in a gale the disappointment is that the cast of actors is sensational and they do everything they can to make the film a coherent reality  but the outcome it to make them look like patsies to a conspiracy  possibly the only saving grace is the final 38 seconds  where the original oneline filmpitch made to the moneyboys gets playedout  but its probably too little too latetranscendence had so much potential johnny depp morgan freeman big budget scifi thriller commenting on the evolutionary struggle between man and machine what could possibly go wrong? everything apparently there is no way that a scientist paul bettany whos been off the grid in a cave somewhere for two years could write a virus that would outsmart a selfaware supercomputer johnny depp so advanced over the same time period that it can literally build a human copy of itself from the sands of the earth no way even if the original source code was written by said cave scientist the movie establishes that the supercomputer has been rewriting its code ever since it became selfaware pauls character wasnt even as smart as the human johnny depp and were expected to believe that paul can outsmart johnny as a supercomputer with unlimited resources? sigh and to the subject of national defense a lone fbi agent whos not even a high ranking official makes the decision to side with a known terrorist group to shut down all networks and electricity on the planet? seriously? the united states government or any other world government would sooner take out the terrorist cell and the fbi agent and negotiate with the supercomputer before allowing all hospitals communication commerce defense and refrigeration to shut down in a moments notice and even if we take the premise that the supercomputer committed suicide to save the life of the scientist who wrote the virus why would he do that? he could have easily saved the scientist his wife rebecca halland everyone else by just taking the gun from the terrorist holding the scientist hostage he can sprout nanotechnology from the ground which is how he took everybody elses gun double sigh i was very disappointed again because this movie had so much potential instead of being awesome its just another classic example of poor script writing and relying on big names and special effects to do the job whats worse the makers of this film should have known better shame normally id give this movie a 410 however for its audacity to advertise brilliance and be anything but it gets a 1to this date if i ask someone to explain me in short what is the premise or to provide really a few short details about the story nobody seems to remember or even explain this movie is so easily absorbed from the memory of everyone once you remove all the stunts and explosions you really have no idea what was the story in the first place? the strength of the mi team is precisely in their team the beautiful synergy of unique talents always contribute in outsmarting their opponents we have such a usable cast from beginning what do we do with them? we kill them all from the beginning why? so that entire script story  for lack of the better word could serve one purpose only  tom cruises ego the second movie is what i consider pornography of such exploitation but lets go back to the first one this is one of those scripts that is precisely tailored to one mans vision everything in this movies serves his own action ambitions that be all fine but it makes me sad that the promise of real mi team was completely destroyed as some have said at previous and im sure will repeat at later date as well  this has absolutely nothing to do with mi seriesto be honest i do not understand how this show has such a great rating it is the worst show i have ever watched cheesy and stupid nothing original ever happens just bunch of dramatic characters i mean how many times will thea cry over the same thing and do something impulsive it happens in every episode they should come up with a better excuse secondly its not sensible the hood does not cover his face its very obvious who he is especially when hes fighting his whole face shows so how can people not realize it i mean if youre gong to make a show about superheroes at least make the watchers fall for it such as batman or spiderman  all of them covered their faces its logic simply terriblethroughout the whole freaking movie i was like damn what a nice movie right there and then it ended in such a way that i want to punch every single retard that had anything to do with the story ending no that is not an inception ending where it brilliantly makes you doubt about the outcome this ending was just plain stupid it was as if at the end of it the writer whispered in my ears ok you paid for it you liked it you waisted your freaking time now get the hell out of this theater as if they lost the budget to fund this movie and they wanted to end working on this movie the sooner possible oh and by the way dear writer for your info why do not play scrabble when we eat octopus whatever what could easily be a massive movie got 100% ruined in just a 5 minutes ending i mean he didnt even sleep with her and u claim this is his child ffs im so mad right now damn youthis year is not very good for the scifi cinematography besides multiple unintentional parodies of the genre like xmen days of future past there was actually only one bigbudget movie worth watching on the edge of tomorrow it seems like tom cruise is one of the few hollywood stars able to wisely pick roles his recent achievements leave little to desire valkyrie or knight and day are good at worst with the high pitch of oblivion are we able to say the same about matthew mcconaughey? unfortunately not although his recent movies are above average true detective or dallas buyers club the latest picture he plays in interstellar directed by christopher nolan and written by him and his brother is a huge letdown and misunderstanding i dont think anyone being fond of hard sciencefiction stories will like it here is why firstly the story it is in general similar to mission to mars or the red planet where the handful of daredevils are put in the spaceship to venture on a mission which result will impact the whole human race unfortunately which is the usual problem in this case the whole plot is neither engaging nor entertaining we have a bunch of uninteresting people making uninteresting things in space maybe because of the long time span of the picture the viewer quickly gets bored and does not care about the main characters besides the space adventure is mixed with the very personal story of the father trying to save his children which is also a timeconsuming thread here anyway the main conclusion of interstellar is the banal statement that love is the most important thing in the world do we really need to sit for almost three hours in the cinema to get this? by coincidence the second problem is the length of the movie currently when the the picture is recorded not on the tape but in the digital medium every director tries to surpass his rivals by creating as long movie as possible maybe it is supposed to be the emblem of his might skills or wisdom? i have no idea but the fact is that the contemporary blockbusters are difficult to watch especially because they last for three or more hours having the plot for only half of this time this is exactly the case with interstellar the presented story is far from complex and could easily fit in two hours in fact the first forty minutes of the movie have nothing to do with the rest of the story and could be recapitulated by the narrator in two sentences this film tries to treat the topic of interstellar travel seriously unfortunately some ideas are presented according to our current knowledge of physics and astronomy while others are just stupid this mixture makes the suspension of disbelief necessary to enjoy such movie impossible to attain on one side we have wormholes black holes higher dimensions of space and the silence of the void on the other hand there is totally unconvincing reality of the xxi century where farmers are more valuable than engineers guys really? and tomography is mysteriously gone in one scene the physicist explains convincingly the work regime of the wormhole by the way this scene is identical to the one from the far better event horizon in another we see the mission robot tars being the member of the crew i know that humanoid machines from fifties seem ridiculous today like the one from the day the earth stood still but they are really the top quality idea compared to the robots depicted in interstellar it is difficult to believe someone created such a model and the whole crew agreed to put it the picture its almost like the the wooden planet from the initial script of alien 3 the number of errors and nonlogical events is just amazing anyone complaining about the lack of consistency in prometheus which was also much better than this one will have the real hunting ground here in fact the more time passes after seeing the movie the more nonsenses are detected dont think about this too much anyway its not worthy the nolan brothers used their imagination a little bit too much in the final part of the story where the word magic interchangeable with nonsense comes to mind as the result the viewer is left at the end indifferent to what is presented on the screen and does not care about the fate of the characters please recall the infamous black hole and you will have the impression of what is going on here the music is of course the extremely important part of every picture if the composer knows his craft the soundtrack complements the images creating the flawless combo as was in terminator starship troopers aliens etc here we have the attempt to create the epic atmosphere but the events shown on screen are rather uninteresting therefore the resulting impression is just the overwhelming noise making the viewer angry instead of touching or moving him unfortunately it seems like making a good movie about the interstellar travel is extremely difficult people like to go to the movies and see a good story there are multiple requirements for the entertaining movie the mystery the convincing scenery the real characters we could care about finally the emotional strain often related to the dangers our protagonists are exposed to interstellar does not offer anything of these it is a long and boring sermon about the future of mankind in the universe pretending to be the sciencefiction movie with this picture christopher nolan proved his only memorable work was prestige and the batman trilogy was not the accident but the clear sign that his main achievements in hollywood will be too long boring and utterly disappointing pictures initially rising hopes for a good time spent in the cinema but leaving in a complete sad disillusion after allthis was the best script they could come up with? this was the best idea on the shelf for the backstory for one of the greatest villains? i am appalled strombergs direction was deplorable it was like watching the phantom menace it just made so little sense that i was forced to stifle laughter but failed then they threw in creatures stolen from every creative fantasy artist in the last 40 years and made the world as pretty as avitar i saw nothing new here nothing but money and an exploited fan base maleficent was an amazing villain and this destroyed that wtfg disney you are the george lucas of fairy tales destroying your own creations i will torrent this film when the riff trax boys riff it the least i can do to recoup the money i feel was swindled from methis was one turkey of a sci fi this is my report near the beginning of the movie a family gets a flat tire in the dustbowl corn fields of any midwestern alternate reality the dad is played by mud and in his alternate world he hangs a 90 and does like seventy through the corn without the slightest bump all the while deftly hacking his laptop to commandeer a nearby drone after stealing the drone mud decides that he must leave his kids to prove to their uppity teacher that nasa really did go to the moon he is chosen by alfred to blast off with catwoman in a reasonably 20th century 3stage rocket that will eventually dock with an incredibly advanced 22nd century space stationrocketship after leaving earth they need no longer adhere to primitive earth technology now they can do anything that already ever happened on star trek including cryosleep when they wake up feeling refreshed they head for a cool wormhole that stanley and alfred told them about they are hoping to find a new planet for all the okies to go to at least thats plan a there is a plan b but its sub pc and is not going to work for mud who is all about hurrying on up back to earth so he can save everyone gotta say more here about muds robot chum as he is remarkable with a fingerprint smeared body consisting of multiple swinging hvac ducts that can navigate through zero gravity run across boulder fields and even walk on water not to mention rescue damsels while carrying on charming banter with a voice socially engineered to be annoying after they go through the wormhole they go to a waterworld where the laws of physics need not apply each hour they spend is equal to 17 years on earth wheres einstein when you need him? the whole planet is covered with 3 feet of water which is fortunate since catwoman cant swim back on earth the dispossessed are aging rapidly with their oldschool monster trucks and other quaint artifacts of 20th century dustbowl arkansas muds kids get growed up and environmentally challenged but its really about how mud abandoned them eventually mud and catwoman go to a really crappy planet that seems even worse than dustbowl earth yet they feel hopeful that they might move their famblys there perhaps down under the frozen ammonia glaciers they find a sinister guy who looks like matt damons dad who gets all evil and blows stuff up mud decides that hes gonna take the tin man and fly into the nearbye black hole that is just 14 billion light years away mudbot knows in his crazybrilliant hillbillysage way that if he just makes a bline through the bhole he is going to pop the cherry with hans zimmer in the house mud trips his way through the fivedimensional space after an abbreviated acid trip thanks kubrick thanks trumbull mud skips the room with the old man and starts floating around in an empty library he peers through the stacks at his pastlife capers while pondering the tangled twists which makes him feel real sad and then he feels real mad and yells at his little daughter who cant even hear him if only he could communicate using just his sheer acting meanwhile muds grownup daughter on earth also feels sad and mad and she tells her brother to argo f himself for not joining her in her cave she doesnt like the air quality either so she torches her bros corn crop harsh then she starts moping around in the old family library the very same one that mud is trapped behind the stacks in except muds library is made by humans from the future at least thats what the robot said suddenly while pondering a wristwatch big daughter has an epiphany and realizes that all you really need is€ € wait for it€ gravity lots of good opportunities to cry here what with mud screaming at the little and big version of his daughter and having epiphanies right and left something no idea what clicks and mud tells the robot to get binary and convert the quantum data into morse code so that he can poweremote it to the wristwatch that daughter is trippin on wait did she just hallucinate? or did the little minute hand start jiggling around? it did do a jiggly wiggly and the jiggles are obviously coded gravitysignal wiggles coming through the blackhole bookshelf world from her crazy hicksavant dad well that about wraps it up needless to say big daughter transcodes the quantum jiggles into fortran code and saves the world or at least makes it a lot less dusty and so that people get to go to hawaii again years later the big daughter becomes really ancient daughter and cryonaps in the hope of seeing mud again darned if some of the freshly quantum jiggled peoples dont figure out how to make space rockets again and they even find mud just in time so that he can come back and be ignored by everybody he saved apparently the robot ran off with catwoman so ancient daughter wakes up and figures it is just so much easier to go to saturn with her tube and her hospital bed a bunch of other family members go with her just for convenience sake and they all gather around her bed when mud comes in they decide to walk out en masse without even glancing at mud even though he is their great granpappy and saved the world and discovered quantum gravity love more sweet sweet tears as dad and daughter commiserate after an appropriate interval daughter wisely tells daddy to go and enjoy his youth steal a spaceship and try and win catwoman back from the swinging robotthis was not a good movie as i thought i was expecting as i saw it was so disappointingwhen i watched the trailer i think it will be a blast butt no i sleep in the first 30 minutes of the movie awfuller but i decided to watch because of reviews i think it will be great in the end but no a bogus story no big thing as was expecting as named guardian of galaxy no way nothing wonderfulthe on other hand the graphics are good but remember when you are tallinn about space or rolling in the galaxy their should be some big and huge things and huge monsters like and the base of story line is so much disappointing as you can see that 5 bunch of buddies save the whole universe man thats not seems gud too me their should be a hero like the villain in the movie butt as i say the villain looks terrible but not as he looks looks like mountain from far but a mice from near loland another thing we saw in movie that the 5 buddies escaped the most advanced jail in the galaxy huh?how man how how how this is ridiculous and please hollywood dont waste our time and money to make movies like this okthis was a tom cruise spy film unfortunately it was not a mission impossible film and that was my problem the overall most important element of the tv series was the plot  the heist the robbery the fraud the trickery the whatever the team the brain the girl the technician the muscle and the actor in effect were only there to move the plot forward but saying that we really got to know and trust these anonymous agents a tribute to such excellent actors as peter graves martin landau and leonard nimoy the first thing that this film does is kill off the team disgraceful and then various members of the new team he puts together turn out to be traitors drivel and then at the end of the film they completely trash the reputation of tvs greatest spy master jim phelps terrible sorry but this is not the film that i wanted to see it says a lot that according to rumour the producers did not see fit to offer any of the original cast members of mission impossible so much as even a silent cameo in this movie imagine the great martin landau as the aged rollin hand what a missed opportunity i think another case of buying a title and doing what you like with it see the saint for further detailsthis truly is a shocking movie and must rank as the worst scifi film i have ever had the misfortune to waste 25hrs on the acting is appalling with some quite amateurish edits the music drowns out a lot of the dialogue which is probably just as well considering its triteness the whole premise of the plot seems to have been cobbled together by the writers after theyd endured an overkill of everything from the lost in space tv series of the sixties though at least that show injected some humour into the proceedings through to 2001 a space odyssey and the innumerable star trek programmes and films any movie that casts michael caine as a scientific boffin must be struggling for starters he utters in one excruciatingly and barely decipherable scene i lied well he certainly didnt act anne hathaway struggles to make any sense of the quite ludicrous script and often appears that shed rather be undergoing rootcanal work whilst matthew mcconaughey mumbles and fumbles his way through lines he cant quite believe he is expected to say the continuity is confusing and the special effects only reach mediocre adding absolutely nothing new in this genre for the viewer i have watched hundreds of scifi films and programmes and do realise that we are expected to suspend belief to a greater extent which is why a little humour would not have gone amiss  but every character in the movie seemed to be so darn miserable and brimming with angst this film has no redeeming features whatsoever one develops no empathy for any of the players and there were a couple i longed would perish within a few minutes of them being introduced into the storyline the child who portrays the tenyear old murphy to name but one sorry but this film is not worthy of wasting over two hours of your precious life on there again you are quite entitled to think otherwisethis show is bad period the only reason is watched it is so that i can bitch about it it has characters and scenes ripped out of batman begins come on with all that budget you could have at least made an effort batman and robin with adam west was more entertaining and one could argue more genuine they had the formula they knew they were being cheesy and they knew they were making it for kids sold but arrow is as lame as they come stephen amell dude nice work with the body building but you could have shaved off some of that hard jaw gritting internalizing stuff he looked like he was constipated most of the time and the man was simply trying too hard to portray oliver queen as a conflicted damaged and deeply hurt it was simply not believable laurel lance oh laurel couldnt one of those arrows accidentally misfired and killed her in episode 1? laurels character is a bimbo who wants to save the world and expects to be fed the truth by everyone she has a relationship with the audience of course wonders why anyone would be truthful to this girl if she simply is not about to handle the truth the saving grace of this entire waste of money comes in the form of david ramsey who plays diggle and paul blackthorne who plays quentin lance brilliant actors who do it well if stephen amell did not have davd ramsey to bounce off a lot of scenes off hed be a dead fish floating on the river nile for all one would care i could go on but in all fairness the actors worked hard i give em that the fault really lies with the writing and direction its movie making at its worst the show is forgettable or maybe to be more accurate this show will be remembered only because it is so bad im giving it two stars  one star for david ramsey and one for paul blackthornethis show is almost indescribably bad it makes me angry just to think about caveat i dont know a whole lot about green arrow his name is oliver queen he gained his skills while marooned on an island hes rich and he is so easy to make fun of but this isnt an attack on the concept ive seen sillier concepts work out to be much better shows arrow is one of those shows where wooden acting poor directing and writing about on par with the twilight saga come together to create one of the most offensive television experiences i have ever had and ive seen jersey shore stephen amell as the titular hero green arrow and katie cassidy as laurel are particularly bad with approximately oneandahalf facial expressions between them and a penchant for removing themselves from the room as the standard method of showing anger you could make a drinking game out of it truly the writing is staggeringly awful however when i say writing im not speaking about the plot that might yet unravel over time but its too early to tell what i mean is the actual words which come out of peoples mouths there is a specific scene which comes to mind where oliver and his best friend tommy are seated at a table discussing their friendship tommy reveals that hes been sleeping with laurel and olivers only reaction is thats okay i forgive you i closed my eyes for this scene and realized that i could not even tell who was saying what at certain points they have no verbal mannerisms and the funny best friend has no real sense of humor that i could discern plus his jokes plain suck but i guess thats a minor point all things considered i should point out that recently a friend told me that tommy merlyn turns into green arrows nemesis which means they of course have a lot in common and might seem like the same person at times but that doesnt really come across as purposeful on this show the directing is maybe the worst offender here because a good director could turn cruddy actors and poor writing into something downright entertaining just look at sam raimis work on spiderman 1 and 2 instead i find myself imagining david barrett or john dahl or any number of the other directors on this show sitting there texting while scenes are happening maybe eating a sandwich or something not paying attention must be hungry work im getting into a lot of detail so im just going to cut this off and say that i should have seen it coming just look at the promo picture really consider it that was the very first thing we were shown regarding this series ask yourself what that says about their prioritiesthis review is written after having seen episodes 16 only who the hell decided to give the green light for this series in this state? honestly the people who made this must have never read a comic book in their lives first off lets get the good things out of the way the plot is very promising and so far its the only thing that keeps me going and the cinematographyeffects are not bad but they could use a little polish here and there especially the choreography of some fight scenes 2 stars from here now what is wrong with this series? they failed on every level to deliver us a show about a superhero they took the idea of the green arrow and crapped all over it firstly the green arrow is supposed to be an incredibly stoic and cynical character when he is monologuing with a witty tongue reserved for his foes someone who used to be a very naive young man once but who was slapped in the face with the realization that the society around him is rotten to the core so he sets off in a crusade to even the balance between the poor and the rich and bring some justice to his corner of the world with only his excellent archery skills as a weapon as a modernday robin hood now the background story the series shows about him being stranded on the island shows this very good however his monologues are not as thoughtprovoking philosophizing or caustically cynical as they appear in the comic books i will give the actor though another star because after watching the first couple episodes he is honestly trying to improve his character and deliver his poorlywritten lines in an arrowlike manner kudos to you sir for actually caring secondly alas the efforts of one person are overshadowed by the failures of the rest of the acting crew plastic dolls posing in shop windows have better acting skills than this lot first and foremost is the annoying exgirlfriend laurel whateverhername who delivers her lines in the most crude way possible i can see her thinking trying to remember what shes supposed to say or what emotion to show in her face its like watching a baboon school play the writing of her character doesnt help either we are supposed to accept that after 5 years she is still in love with the guy who cheated on her with her friggin sister and who is responsible for her death? and how about his mother that apparently killed her husband but threatens to raise hell if a hair of one of her family is even touched and then we come to the third and most crucial failing of this series this is supposed to be a series about a superhero i dont care at all about the sex life of his exgirlfriend i dont care about the sisters drinking problem i dont care about the social life of anyone partly because they fail as characters but mostly because this is a series about a superhero this isnt the days of our lives or sex & the city im not expecting to watch romantic crap about women on their period im expecting to watch a superhero kick ass bring justice to the wicked and perform some general pwnage dont get me wrong i can understand showing how his actions to hide his alter ego affect those around him and how in turn he is affected himself i like to see some inner conflict in my super heroes what i dont like is the green arrow being a supporting actor in his own series an average episode goes about 40 minutes and 30 of those are spent showing us uninteresting flirting between his friends and family then the green arrow steps in the room and says he has to go to fight bad guys but instead of following him we are stuck for another 45 minutes to witness the constant crying of his friends and family of how he never spends time with them i dont care seriously imagine watching a series about batman that all it does is show catwoman talk to her girlfriends about how she is in love with a really cute guy called clark kent yes clark kent thats how messed up arrow is a terrible effort and an outright insult dont waste your time at least for now its still pretty early in the production only 6 episodes so far and as i said the plot seems interesting perhaps the cw network will come around to realizing how much more they could do with this series and improve it later on in the season one can only hopethis really is an extremely poor film by any standards obviously paid contributors have boosted its score to ridiculous levels memento was absolutely brilliant but christopher nolans films from then on have got worse and worse a distinct case of the emperors new clothes inception was a sheer disaster with loads of holes in plot and characterisation but this lacks any interesting plot or characters whatsoever for a start it is obvious that nolan went to see 2001  a space odyssey when he was younger and has been dreaming about remaking it and taking it further um well messrs clarke and kubrick made a better job of it thats the end of the film written off  dont pay attention to the very last fifteen minutes it is an embarrassment except for the star wars imagery the main plot is mankind is doomed and only a mission to outer space through a wormhole can save us a few films have done this better there is no money for space exploration apparently but nobody notices numerous rockets being fired into space please when the mission lands on one of the selected planets the plot comes close to utter stupidity trying to resemble total recall and it does not get any better as we rerun gravity and 2001 before the starchild repeat plot goes even more haywire then there is so much mumbo jumbo that one loses interest entirely the space sequences unfortunately have been trumped by gravity so the spectacle is empty and ungripping the actors try but who cares about such an overhyped unbelievable piece of twaddle and s a note to mr nolan jnr  go and watch shane if you want to make a movie about love and family otherwise give us all a rest from your illconceived socalled masterpiecesthis really is a very poor plot indeed  but it would be unfair to list the many logical flaws here and so spill the story but you can look up other websites for the synopsis if you want to discover what i mean in summary though not only does the plot defy all reasonable logic and expectations of a true police investigation but its as if the author gets so far and doesnt know how to end the story and after dragging it one for nearly 2 12 hours panics and ends it all abruptly very unsatisfactorily the characterisation suddenly implodes at the end and the main character played by ben affleck who has been stable and consistent the rest of the movie within the last 5 minutes suddenly changes 360 degrees to become a completely different character which again makes no sense it really is a waste of time and money to buy this dvd i believe 90% of anyone who buys this dvd would not also be disappointed with their purchase after viewingthis movie would have been better if it was only about tars and drones and robots and completely remove humans characters and the damn corny filler dialogue all that hard science special effects scientists working together making it seem most real bound together by fantasy and bullshit and missing plot lines and time paradoxes and love and religion this movie is really a cheeseball hollywood film with a hard science backdrop the characters were as flat as a piece of paper the guy likes the girl the daughter is mad at dad dad loves daughter doesnt care about saving mankind even tars had more personality than many of the movies characters the daughter was probably most developed but felt so off still she holds a grudge 30 years later is a movie for average joe blow using the bedazzle tactic of impressing you with confusing story special effects and hard science when is really no meat and nothing useful tars gets 1010 rest of the movie 110 i have learned nothing made me think about nothing wasted my timethis movie was way too long scenes were dragged out unnecessarily matt damons appearance was random to say the least and added nothing to the story the plot was weak and made no logical sense this was such a disappointment i cant believe i have seen the same movie as those who have given it 9 stars???? all in all i felt this was a wasted 3 hours of my life that i will not get back this movie was so bad it made gravity look amazing and amazing it wasnt i felt that the music in the film was so loud at times that this drowned out key points in the plot and it wasnt an enjoyable experience straining your ears to try and figure out what was going on in the movie i found it hard to connect with any of the characters which was a let down as i love matthew mcconaghey and anne hathawaythis movie was so boring i literally had to leave the theater before i fell asleep sitting upright i gave interstellar a full hour to get more interesting considering the rave reviews and ratings on this site that prompted me to see it but i couldnt wait any longer the film was scientifically implausible to such an extent that i could not suspend disbelief and enjoy the film at face value the character development was weak the protagonist was arrogant and unlikable and the acting talent of many great actors was utterly wasted on this bomb the dialog was predictable unimaginative and flat while it did not affect the quality of the film i was disappointed that the movie was based on the dangerous delusion that human beings might be able to find a new home in space so people dont have to think too much about taking action on the very real climate change that is destroying planet earth right now but it was the series of stupid moments in the first hour that informed me interstellar was not going to meet my standards for an intelligent film the first stupid moment was during the lifethreatening giant dust storm scene complete with large chunks of flying debris after the family jumps into the truck and races home for shelter the driver inexplicably parks the truck about fifteen yards away from the front door so that they all have to run outside through the dust storm before reaching the house huh? another stupid moment was when the protagonist is asked to pilot a gargantuan stateoftheart space craft apparently built by a few dozen people without any budget less than an hour after he first surprises nasa with his first arrival this pilot has not flown an aircraft for years and there is no way anyone no matter how experienced he once was could fully master the technology of this ship and be prepared for a complex space mission in the extremely short period of time that elapsed evidenced by no change in the age of the pilots children between being asked to captain the ship and actually doing so he almost instantly assumes full command of the ship and the crew and successfully takes the ship into deep outer space on a dangerous mission this sequence of events had no credibility it felt like some adolescent boys fantasy come true the laststraw final stupid moment was when i realized that the female astronaut played by anne hathaway is wearing fresh makeup everyday including false eyelashes not a big deal considering the major problems with this film but it nevertheless annoyed me what competent astronaut is going to waste time and energy applying false eyelashes in outer space during a serious space mission? how would several years worth of cosmetics along with false eyelashes even get approved as cargo given the severe space limitations of a spaceship? how are we supposed to find this astronaut credible? thats when i realized it really was time to abandon the film i was getting downright irritablethis movie was awful i was deceived by the fake rating it was full of pseudoscience so superficial and boring every single minutes could be challenged by a science professional being a phd student in science i envy scifi script writers and directors that they can pop up any bullshit and be praised by nonprofessional audience such a ridiculous robot underground nasa that launches billion dollar projects in famine a condition the huge tide on that planet without considering the depth of water entering the blackhole unprotected love being the 5th dimension contacting through blackhole by pushing the books oh my can anybody be more superficial about science? my advice to anybody who has a critical mind dont waist your timethis movie was awful for a number of reasons first it is a terrible story for young kids especially young girls it constantly says that there is no love and the true love kiss is from angelia to the young girl i am all for female empowerment but female empowerment can do better than being anti man second the whole movie was cgi they put almost no effort into making this movie at all disney could have put a lot more effort into making this script and into the costume design plus angelia was super creepy anti fairy tales are all the rage and they can be made well but this is not one of them its ok to have a story that makes you feel good instead of making you feel like garbage at the endthis movie was a complete waste of money and time the supposed rape scene was nothing more than a greedy human being tearing off the limbs of an angel the ending of the movie was completely absurd thank you disney my six year old daughter was heartbroken and crying thanks you ending daddy daddy does this mean true love doesnt exist? of course it does what were you trying to pull with this ending?? my daughter deserved better than some sick twisted fairytale i trusted you disney this is the first movie your company has ever done where it portrays gruesome fighting and killing plus you destroyed any ideas about love and romance in review i thought the movie deserved at least a 410 but my daughter wants me to say 110 so here you go disney 110this movie started out slow but had a typical predictable storyline untilcolin firths character went on a psychotic killing spree and literally killed an entire church full of people singlehandedly the violence was beyond gruesome poles being shoved up underneath peoples chins into their heads stabbings shootings anything you can think of i havent wanted to walk out of a movie more fast than this one but i stuck it out because i was with someone else and figured it couldnt get any worse wrong next thing you know there are microchips overheating and making hundreds of peoples heads explode all to music it was horrendous but wait theres more lets not forget the useless show of a bare a$$ of some princess who wants to thank the teenager for saving the day and let him mount her sexist much? are you effing kidding me? i want my money backthis movie reminded me a lot about a book by a guy named thien called the dream chip almost too much like thiens book in the dream chip peoples thoughts and memories are uploaded into a super computer hollywood approximated thiens book the dream chip very very closely in the final cut with robin williams maybe thats why the writers guild of america wga has something called the script registry to protect writers from such unscrupulous behaviors by hollywood studios its probably all just a coincidence or why does the writers guild of america wga have something called the script registry? but this movie doesnt have the strength and guts of thiens book titled the dream chip nor did the final cut thiens book has much more guts too many coincidences for me and way too boring one starthis movie just sucked it was so damn juvenile that as an adult i felt as board and uninterested as listening to a 10 year old tell me how their day went at elementary school theres a main underlying premise but not much happens between the beginning of the movie and the end and the damn thing is about 2 hours long chris pratts character was a ripoff han solo but extremely laidback to the point of being annoying and too hip with a douche brosurfer attitude zoe saldanas character was uninteresting and relatively weak in the story when she could have had a bigger part and that damn raccoon voiced by bradley cooper was more annoying than jar jar binks in star wars this movie rips off star wars in many way down to the retrolike scifi look of the movie half and i mean it seemed like halfit was that boring the movie took place in a prison and nothing really happened besides their dumb escapetrust me it was stupid how they escaped this movie is like watching an incoherent childs illogical dream it is an orgy of impossible childlike fantasy there is nothing in it that made sense and there is nothing that engaged the viewer the antagonist is invincible but wait no hes notthe protagonist is a fragile human but wait no hes notits probably one of the most poorly written comic book adaptations in cinema history hell or its probably one of the best marvel comic books are pathetically stupid anyway i hate this movie with a passion and i so regret seeing it do yourself a favor and skip this boring extremely poorly written filmthis movie just made me sad  i was sad for the ruined original story sad because of the terrible writing and predictable plot but most of all sad for all the actors and staff who invested time and energy into this absolute disaster of a movie theres a lot of talent here to work with unfortunately it was all wasted the movie looks fake and fabricated which of course it was there was little real cinematic effort with every environment and most of the characters being cgi there was very little for the actors to interact with as a result we the audience get yet another generic and artificial theme park ride sadly we get so many of those nowadays that instead of making us smile they make us sick i think the movie was ultimately about women empowerment which worked perfectly fine in frozen here though the message was pushed over the idea of true love  a classic motive in almost all fairy tales and child stories so was it worth it ?this movie is supposed to be a movie about life but life is more exiting than that if life were as boring and messed up as represented in the movie the rate of suicides would be much much higher as i watched this movie i expected something to happen but nothing ever did it is as if this movie was intended to make people depressed even the main actor that weird male version of kirsten stewart looked depressed and is it just me or he couldnt articulate properly? extremely irritating youd think that 12 years is enough time for someone to make a masterpiece hahaha as stated on the title ive seen commercials more exciting than that movie i dont think it deserved any oscar nominations the acting wasnt particularly good excepting the father he was the only character that didnt look depressed the story didnt have a plot or anything the movie is as pointless as a circle to imdb why is the rating so high??? 82 seriously???? this movie makes me wish there was a 0 star rating well i guess they can get one star for the effort i normally trust imdb ratings and check them for every movie i ever intend to watch however this rating is waaaayyyy too high for one of the worst movies ive ever had the misfortune to watch it is almost insulting how this movie can be amongst movies like the godfather goodfellas the lord of the rings inception movies that are actually good interesting to watch and a good conversational topic i seriously dont understand this rating out of all the friends and family members that have seen this movie no one has said anything good about it i tend to be positive but this movie is a serious wast of timethis movie is not a 1 in reality its more a 56 but i need to make that stupid average rating go down i couldnt understand why this movie has a 90 in imdb but now reading the comments here i finally get it its good advertisement the best advertisement that i have seen in many years this movie will drive you crazy if you know something about astrophysics or normal physic and you have seen enough movies in your life because there are way too many clichs and too many pseudophysics not fake physics like the disneys films pseudophysics like ancient aliens from history channel ps sorry for my englishthis movie is not a 1 in reality its more a 56 but i need to make that stupid average rating go down i couldnt understand why this movie has a 90 in imdb but now reading the comments here i finally get it its good advertisement the best advertisement that i have seen in many years this movie will drive you crazy if you know something about astrophysics or normal physic and you have seen enough movies in your life because there are way too many clich_s and too many pseudophysics not fake physics like the disneys films pseudophysics like ancient aliens from history channel ps sorry for my englishthis movie is not 1 out of 10 but i have to give this rating so that we can balance its position interstellar tries too much to make you belief it is all about science but the truth is that it is not  i can can say until matt damon appears in the movie everything goes well from that point absurdity and nonsense begin what the hell is a space ship hanging out into a black hole like taking a walk on the street every 3 dimensional object turns into light or energy with black holes incredible and unmeasurable gravity however our full of science movie demonstrates that you can get rid off a black hole with a jet engine  after that scene i realized that this film is way too much more fiction than science what about our hero walks into a black hole at one piece  oops i forget he is into a space outfit it explains everything  this film acts like the gravity movie but in fact its more like star trekthis movie is genius what? seriously? first off possible spoilers although im mostly going to try to avoid them second off seriously??? third its not really a one star movie its like 57ish depending on how you want to weight various factors im just doing this because all the hype and all the stellar pun intended reviews are blowing my mind and need to be balanced out this movie is ok im a scifi geek and an apocalypse movie geek this was kind of supposed to have both so how could i go wrong? easily apparently if you like movies that actually make sense this film is not for you if you have any common sense or a logical brain youll know what i mean when you see it for me this film falls into the big flashy substance free summer blockbuster category aside from the fact that it was released in fall if you like big flashy special effects movies with no substance youll probably love it because youre ok with just going for the ride if you like movies that make sense and have cohesive plots you will likely be irritated when this strays from those lofty goals and stray it does a lot he tried to make a great movie but ended up with one that doesnt quite get there this movie like so many movies with generally promising plots falls down all over the place in the execution or more specifically the script itself special effects were killer with lots of great visuals all the directing portions of the movie were well done so i suppose i can say nolan did a great job directing the movie all the actors were just fine the problem was with what they were told to act out so nolan did not do a good job as writer perhaps he should stick to directing which he is quite good at let me say this im not a pompous arrogant guy in real life but sometimes i wonder if having a couple dozen iq points over average just ruins films for me so many movies have everything this one does good basic premise good acting great special effects horrible scripts that make absolutely no sense for anyone with a brain so where to begin? in my opinion a huge percentage of movies especially scifi require that you accept a basic premise many of them do not make sense this can be ok you just have to roll with it even if its a little off think zombie movies i love zombies but really with the setupexplanation of how most zombie viruses spread and how awesome our military is and how slow zombies are or even if theyre fast zombies its a ridiculous premise the mess would last about a week and then get under control how exactly does a zombie take out an abrams tank again??? but i roll with it this movies basic premise is slightly flawed but not so much so that it has to completely ruin the movie there are cases where the basic idea is so bad i cant get past it but this isnt one earth is basically overwhelmed by bad weather and crop killing plagues it happens in real life the dust bowl was rough and so was the irish potato famine the truth is that we could deal with those easily on earth but let us pretend we couldnt and move on my problem is with the endless series of things that either outright dont make any sense or things where you have to stretch it pretty far mentally and basically cover up for the writing by buying into implausible silly reasons for things how exactly does everyone still drive around gas guzzling trucks and yet are enthralled by a few small solar panels they can pull off of a uav? how do they have all this infrastructure for pointless things yet they cant keep control of said uav or like make parts for their robotic farm equipment they rig up from scraps? thats the first like 2 seconds of the movie this movie is a death of a thousand cuts going point by point would take way too long in my opinion this movie didnt have any deal killer plot holes as in no one thing completely made my head instantly explode but what did happen was by the end of the 2nd hour there were so many little silly things piling up that it just went beyond the pale theres plenty to be desired in terms of the time dilation stuff making sense but most of it does if you think it through logically and do the math perhaps not 100% though to me it just had a general vibe of meh with a lot of little stuff then theres the non logical portion of the story aka the human story also being meh its like they kind of want you to think cooper and brand had a love thing maybe? or at least cooper does for her but then no development but then he rushes off at the end after her is that a platonic hero thing or was that supposed to be the big romance story? you dont even know because it was such a mess its not that the actors couldnt have acted it out fine but it just doesnt happen i found myself not really caring about any of them much because none of them were developed cooper was a pretty cool dude but other than that i didnt take a lot away thats it im done typing in short feel free to watch it but just be forewarned if you have an analytical mind that you will find many portions of the movie causing minor brain aneurysmsthis movie is based on clichs all over i tried really tried to get into it for about 152 hours but it was impossible seriously top 5 worst movies i have ever watched at the beginning you still have hope that the movie could be reasonable good performance of some actors you start getting into the boys life but this hope just fades away as the movie develops as extremely unexciting imagine a boring life of a boy living in the usa translate that into a 3 hour movie but taking away any potential exciting moments the ones with adrenaline interesting intellectual reflections sex etc etc thats what this movie is i am usually not that bold in criticizing movies but this one deserves it sorry but it does even the 10 minutes i watched of sharknado were better at least it was a bit funnythis movie is based on clich_s all over i tried really tried to get into it for about 152 hours but it was impossible seriously top 5 worst movies i have ever watched at the beginning you still have hope that the movie could be

time so pathetic pretentious wannabe philosophic nolans puke with terrible acting nothing more than that are people becoming this dumb to find this movie actually good? i could not find anything in it that would touch me move me it was just so empty without any wow moment except maybe the water part what was the point of this movie? i feel it has none  maybe just to make money as that is the point of life we live for these days love as a premise is ok but it just got waisted in this one sorry to all who liked it but something is going so wrong in hollywood i feel so embarrassed for the movie industrythis movie is a darn shame for its poor ability to tell a story and i am a bona fide scifi lover this movie is a pale imitation of 2001 a space odyssey from the 1960s and it will leave people who lack a significant scifi background scratching their heads and asking themselves what did i just see? what did it mean? plot synopsis earth is dying a slow ecological death the dust bowl is back bigger and badder than ever crops are failing one by one all we can grow is corn and you know what happened to ireland when it tried monoculture the potato famine earths only hope is to send expeditions through a black holewormhole thats conveniently appeared near saturn in the movie 2001 the earth was poised on the brink of mutually assured nuclear destruction and a monolith appeared in the orbit of jupiter so we sent a mission to it with a bunch of hibernating astronauts and an insane homicidal computer in interstellar the missions hope is to find a habitable planet at the other end of the wormhole to achieve this mission a nasa gone underground sends the wobbliest spindliest ship you might imagine with a bunch of hibernating astronauts and a very personable security robot the space vehicle thats sent looks like it could easily be crushed in the tidal gravitational forces of a black hole it takes an additional two hours for the movie to explore what happens on the other side of the black hole the special effects and cgi are probably very good in this movie but seeing it in imax presented two problems first the focus was not very good when projecting the movie that large second its impossible to take in the entire screen you must constantly scan back and forth across the image because the filmmakers emphasis was sometimes towards the edge of the screen this appears to be a frequent problem with popular releases shown in imax and i keep forgetting about this problem i really wanted to like this film i didntthis movie is a complete joke the only thing going for it is the visual effects in the 1959 disney classic maleficent is the mistress of evil and she was perfect in that role but in this nonsense movie she is a good person? her name does not seem good at all also i want to write in some details why i did not like this movie and why the story was very weak in my opinion first why is king stefan evil? why did he send aurora to live with the three fairies until she is 16? is he crazy? the curse stated that she will go into a sleep like death when she is 16 so why the hell will he send his daughter away all those years and never even visit her? he could have made her live with them until she is 16 and protected her in the castle or told the fairies to come and protect her on that day and coming to the fairies they portray them as idiots the good fairies are idiots? and prince philip is not the true love of aurora? what nonsense finally the motherly kiss of maleficent lifts the curse? she put it on in the first place and finally maleficent kills stefan auroras father and aurora is happy about that? what the hell? really a silly movie i gave it 210 just because of the cgi which hollywood seem to think that this will save all movies not good writing and castingthis movie has received unanimous acclaim from critics and is hugely popular with practically everyone else and i really cant understand why for me it fails to do the one thing a movie absolutely has to do  entertain it looks like a film studies exercise a technical achievement for sure but not a film made with the viewing public in mind for starters the near enough three hour run time is excessive to say the least boyhood is an unusual film that could end at any time during it and feel no less complete than the final cut this is what is baffling to me why couldnt they have started with mason a little older? or finished a little younger? it would still be as bland an ending as we ended up with there were opportunities within the film to elaborate on some of the plot points that arose for example the dinner scene with the lecturer as masons stepfather and its aftermath or in particular the all too brief part when he was confronted by a group of kids in the bathroom did we see how this affected mason as a person? did we see how he resolved the problem? no it was completely ignored and we continued at the horribly slow pace which still relentlessly ploughs on regardless of any potentially interesting events that may occur and finally perhaps the most irritating part of this film mason himself i cant understand why a film centred so heavily around a single protagonist would write a character to be so bland and unlikeable he spends the first half of the movie watching the mundane unexceptional world and people around him saying and doing nothing  i know hes just a young kid but he may as well not even be there the second half may be even worse as he goes from being a bland lifeless child to a completely unlikeable young adult he talks like he knows everything about life which at his age he clearly doesnt and makes a halfarsed attempt at becoming a photographer by going to college great nobody cares yet somehow they drag this out for as long as most other films last in total thankfully the movie ends rather abruptly at this point the movie may well be like real life but why is that entertaining? for a film centred on one characters life to work their story has to be interesting or unusual a film about an emotionless kid growing up to be an emotionless teen is as boring as it sounds linklater deserves the directing oscar for sticking by a project for 12 years and having such an original idea but the final product has wasted three hours of my life and if you havent seen it yet i really wouldnt waste your timethis movie has an agenda and to entertain is not it first off the first third of the movie was about how man has destroyed the earth and we who are left all live in a remake of the dust bowl days with what i assume was actual dust bowl survivors testifying in the movie about how bad it was when a movie puts in crap that jerks you out of the moment and then makes you try to figure out if its really part of the movie or did you wander into a ken burns documentary your in trouble with trying to be entertained and propaganda is on the way we have to find a new world to live on and there has been some unknown intelligent and i say that only because that is what the movie portrays it to be unlike the director and writers beings that through gravity have given clues or some type of morse code through gravitational binary code to draw scientist attention to the worm hole opened up to a new part of the universe the second part of the movie and agenda driven plot is about how man needs to keep spending money on going to the moon space and beyond anyone who thinks it was a waste is deemed an idiot as in the movie where the school board rewrites the school books saying that the moon landings were faked the last bit deals with time relativity and and while exploring the new earth time goes at 7 years to one hour so when mathew mcconaughey comes home his 10 yo daughter is now dying in bedonly to chase him out of the room then there are the million questions that dont add up there is no army any more lol like a world of drought and no or little food only corn would not have riots and other hostile countries trying to take what we had mcconaughy is drinking beer in the fist part of the movie where the hell did the barley or wheat come from if they only have corn and where did nasa come from in the middle of a corn field if there is no us government to build all this crap? its a known fact that the scientists at nasa built not a darn thing nor ever have its all those corporations that get the contracts to build everything from the pencils the geeks use to the launch vehicles and produce the fuel to move them nasa does not so much as put one bolt in one hole micheal cains character ages some 25 give or take years and he does not look any different than he did at the beginning damn that geritol is working good this movies is flat and leaves you disgusted much like contact you will learn to swear after leaving if you dont know it will only be loved by the geeks who love anything with a spaceship in it and dont care or understand content or plot and by the hippie eco nuts who want to use it to push the idea we have to ban oil and hummers do not waste your hard earned money on this loserthis movie fails to show why a remake was necessary it fails to bring the morals of the old movie into the modern world and it fails to develop the characters overall it also shows a disappointing amount of visual inconsistency just to promote one hollywood star the femalefemalerelationship as central point rather than the male femalerelationship is nothing new since frozen in fact prince philip who is even more onedimensional than his cartoonversion is still there at the end to be the one and only considering how easy this film avoids any conversational aspects between auroras real parents and adoptive parents just shows that plot development and modern problems were not what the writers thought about auroras mother dies offscreen and nobody not her husband not her daughter ever seem to take any notice just to avoid any problems between the two mother figures in this movie not only the queen and the young prince are loosing screentime and depth the three good fairies in the original had personalities while they are now only a bunch of annoying and incompetent additions for the sake of obvious humor the third fairy never actually was able to give her wish the movie never explains this plot whole maleficent is a movie starring a cartoonist version of angelina jolie in a movie about angelina jolie no character apart from her has been developed with any love or thought they are all background for more angelina jolie overall i am deeply disappointed if you compare the old sleeping beauty with the new movie you can see the disney tendency to go from timeless movies to something that looks great but communicates nothing dont watch it with your children they will not learn more than what they can get from the old movies dont watch it for the sake of nostalgia because its unable to provide the same quality it used to before 3d was able to overcome any plot wholes and dont watch it for the sake of crafty 3d the same expected shots of flying sunsets and growing plants are used over and over again you will get tired of seeing the same overly perfect shot repetitivelythis movie based on an amazing book and was drawn into a dramatic and hyper realistic screenplay by spielberg before that script was ultimately butchered into this movie by christopher nolan read the summary of the original script  it is such a good idea for a movie space sex? how cool what we have with interstellar is crying in space every character gets at least one long crying scene its too much the soundtrack is repetitive and exhausting the dialogue is bland the backstory is weak and i could go on but none of this is my real grip with interstellar i think the movie is unrealistic but not in a physics of space isnt real enough kinda way  which is the complaint most people have when saying this movie is unrealistic i thought the characters were unrealistic i just couldnt believe that they believed we hadnt gone to the moon in a day when traveling to saturn as a species is possible i couldnt believe that matthew mcc would be so emotionally weak yet be able to hack a predator drone on the fly and be an expert farmer and an expert pilot i couldnt believe the length that the characters would go to in order to deceive eachother now for the technology  i am okay with it being a little off but the inconsistency is what is tough to swallow but you saw regular normal ol saturn rocket boosters needed to get off of earth yet they could zip around near a black hole with gravity 8000 times that of earth with tiny little engines? they have artificial intelligence capable of reliable and supercomplex reasoning with extremely strong limbs and they chose to give it a refrigerator for a chassis?this might very well be the worst movie ever how it won best motion is beyond me the freaking use of the camera is just bad there is something documentaryish about the shooting of certain scenes like what you see in natgeo i cant seem to pinpoint the exact thing about it that ticks me off maybe it is the contrast coupled with the extreme clarity of the whole film anyway it just doesnt seem appropriate because it gave the whole movie a boring and lackluster feel most importantly i am so disappointed in the actors i love johnny depp but his character fell flat throughout the film he isnt a character i want to know more about and i cant detect any real sense of affection between the main couple their acting feels amateurish and johnny depp just lost a fan congrats i cannot bring myself to watch the whole thing because i just lost interest after he became a computer you might think thats when things get juicy well it didnt it got even more boring and clich basically the movies a real drag and the execution is horrible one good thing the concept is quite novel and pretty good too bad pfister screwed it up anyway dont watch it its uninspiringthis might very well be the worst movie ever how it won best motion is beyond me the freaking use of the camera is just bad there is

didnt it got even more boring and clich_ basically the movies a real drag and the execution is horrible one good thing the concept is quite novel and pretty good too bad pfister screwed it up anyway dont watch it its uninspiringthis is without exception one of the dumbest films i have ever sat through or perhaps its a masterpiece and im too dumb to understand it? anyway  here are some of the things the list is not exhaustive that i could not get my head around there is a catastrophic failure in most of the crops of the world and the entire scientific community simply shrugs and says oh well dems the breaks and does nothing seriously? apart from that one dude in the super secret nasa compound? okay then a super intelligent super advanced alien civilization has been watching us they see that the planet is in peril that more than six thousand million people will die from starvation so they offer a solution not by curing the blight mind no that would be far too easy they construct a wormhole they being five dimensional creatures n all close to saturn cos kubrick had already used jupiter in 2001 the film makes a big deal about corn being the only viable crop still resisting the blight cornmash beer anybody but its only a matter of time before that too succumbs so its a matter of great urgency that the astroheroes get to the ol wormhole as quickly as possible so the far side of the moon would be a handy place to put it no no noooo they place the wormhole beside saturn so distant from earth that it takes two years just to fly there and all the while any poor kids unfortunate enough to be called dusty are getting the crap beaten out of them at pharming college anybody for cornflakes? now nasa have already explored the wormhole they know that it opens into another galaxy beside a black hole and an assortment of potential new worlds because of the proximity of the planets to the black hole time will be distorted and a couple of hours exploring these new worlds will translate to decades back on earth while back on ol planet earth the corn crops fail and the dust storms gather pace so this was the plan? by the super intelligent aliens? is someone taking the p*ss? there were no planets anywhere that were  um  not right beside a black hole? super intelligent? doh and so finally after a number of silly subplots our hero finally descends onto the event horizon of the black hole my god its full of stars? and experiences time as a physical construct but is he shown the origin of the blight that is wiping out the planet so that he might alert the scientific community? hell no he is shown his daughters bedroom on the day that he left on his weekend getaway we see him getting really upset that his daughter isnt picking up on his stay  stay gravity assisted message even though he should remember that she shouted stay  stay to him on that day and he left anyway sheesh and zimmers soundtrack? i hadnt heard about the soundtrack request came to him via email without him ever seeing the movie explains a lot really presumably the email went something like if you produce anything orchestral like kubrick youre off the project so the soundtrack consisted almost entirely of ponderous bass heavy synth driven in the cinema where i watched it piercingly loud quasi classical discordance bear in mind that kubrick chose the pieces by strauss etc to assist him in editing the movieand then realised that they actually fit perfectly and so discarded the original soundtrack that he had commissioned not nolan nosirreebob email it in hans who listens to the music anyway? deeply deeply disappointing and i loved inceptionthis is weird i love science fiction and i love astrophysics but disliked everything about this movie the start was extremely slow and it was hard to stay awake the second half of the movie was somewhat better but felt like a very cheap ripoff of space 2001 the movie just didnt do it for me at all and the acting was average im totally flabbergasted that the average rating stands at 9 out of 10 maybe audiences have lost the notion of quality storyline plot acting and uniqueness  as this movie doesnt have any of it ah well i guess ill just have to wait for the next sf movie and hope it will be somewhat better because i am deeply disappointed by interstellar as i expected so much more from a movie with an estimated budget of $165 millionthis is the movie that proves what many people by now have already realized people are being payed to write 10 stars fake reviews let me tell you this this movie is really not that great first its too long it takes one hour just for the space mission to start its slow paced and very sentimental or in other words most of it is boring im not an english native speaker but my english is not bad either i have no problems watching movies in english and yet it was very hard for me to understand the main characters mumbling in his farmer accent all other actors spoke properly except him the most important one the plot is not very logical planets just in front of a giant black hole? yes this must be the place to live everybody is dreaming of imagine your colleagues in the space station would say to you ok were now ready to fly down to that planet you wait here dont worry well come back soon in some years youd probably smile and say wonderful ok go now right? one day they come back and are probably surprised to see you havent committed suicide because of depression even though you waited 23 years  for them you must be the most patience man in the entire universe and again a female scientist who looks like a model and behaves like an amateur an obligatory part of every scifi movie nowadays this is just to give you an idea there is much more so read the other negative reviews good night and good luckthis is the emperors new clothes all over again the movie runs two hours and 45 minutes to cover 12 years and believe me it seems like 12 years there is nothing of interest in the film it is about nothing nothing happens except children grow up parents grow up children make friends parents marry again and again no drama no humor no sadness no happiness just boring people leading boring lives and the gimmick of using real children and filming them at yearly intervals to show how they grow is just that a gimmick the boy of the title is a slacker seeking meaning by doing nothing save your money and more important save your three hours and see another movie any other moviethis is the dumbest movie i ever watched i felt insulted by it there is no discernible logic the script seems written by 1000 monkeysd its a pity they did this because the idea could have lead to a very intriguing and interesting story but they wasted it i didnt even worry to watch it to the end i left the theater and drove home they even wasted good actors they seemed so bored they didnt even pretend to act what were the producers and the director thinking? my recommendation dont waste your time watching this  read a book insteadthis is the biggest disappointment ive had at the theater in a long time even worse than noah the idea was outstanding with the flavor of 007 james bond from live and let die days with the cool gadgets and the cheeky humor everyone i know wanted to see this movie then they put in more cussing than scarface and more blood than kill bill and drowned it in a hard r that left the audience stunned and confused if this movie had been a pg13 for the family it would have been the beginning of a chain of profitable and enjoyable movies for these folks instead they made fun of rednecks and republicans used the fword as a conjunction in every sentence in the movie had scenes that were so brutal and outofplace in this funny little movie that i looked at my wife and mother and they were covering their eyes they drowned this guaranteed winner in obscenity and blood if you are an 18 year old marine or just out of jail enjoy if you are a parent or on a date or any other member of the target audience for movies skip this sleazy piece of poopthis is one story i was told as a child which is totally destroyed by this movie something told to children by generation of parents totally twisted kiss of true love? no prince no dragon? it seems that nothing in this world is immune to free love movement i do respect everyone but some things should stay as they were whats next snowwhite is kissed by a witch who was always good inside? hansel & gretel were two boys? princess returned glass slipper to cinderella and they lived for ever and ever? on the other side acting effects sound everything is excellent but i do think it should be another story all by itself disney its a shame what you did with this epic story just to be in the flowthis is one of those movies that should not have been made it is basically a d rated story with scifi thrown in to sell tickets the science is horrible so it only acts to aggravate scifi fans who assumed they would get something that is at least half researched so how is it bad? lets see they build up ai as something superhuman only to find out that it is easily foilable with a simple computer virus written in a matter of hours by a few hackers the authorities decide to collude with terrorists to combat a future perceived threat that has not actually committed any sort of crime the terrorist are basically your run of the mill antitech revolutionaries with brains the size of toe nail clippings and all happen to be scientists themselves the movie cheapens science and scientists considerably making them appear petty brutal and plain stupid which is actually incredible offensive to those who worked hard to achieve something in the field skip this movie just watch a cheap mexican soap opera it will be time better spentthis is one of the worst films in recent memory everything about it was terrible the score the acting the characters the dialogue and the absolutely ridiculous and insulting holefilled plot do not waste your money on this garbage it will only make you angry not a single note of this film rings true nothing that happens seems even remotely plausible spoilers the pike character frames the man she kills for her kidnapping and the police buy it not really sure why they dont check to see if he had an alibi for the day she disappeared not really sure why they believe that she murdered her kidnapper while being raped and then instead of calling 911 she got in a car covered in blood and drove to another state to be with her husband who  according to her own diary  she believed hated her and wanted to kill her writing this and having to remember this stupid film is making me angry again im gonna stop dont go see this garbage watch body heat instead it is way betterthis is not the worst remake in film history i have never understood the idea of a remake at all if an anime like cinderella monogatarie is so good to start with why on earth do you want to try and improve on it? if you insist on tampering with perfection why then do you have to try to recreate it in its whole? there is nothing original here kenneth branagh put nothing of himself into this film they say imitation is the highest form of flattery but this is ridiculous there are a lot of sides to a parable as complex as cindarella and i suspect that branagh may have wanted to explore them instead the studio forced him into sticking to a cheap liveaction imitation of the popular anime in the end kenneth branagh set out to pay homage to a great anime instead he cheapened it and created a movie that is not worthy of late night cablethis is my first review and i am compelled to write it t counter all the 10 star ratings this is possibly the worst movie ever made i fell asleep several times and would have left had i not been sitting in the middle of the row of seats i wanted to ask for my money back at the end of the film its just boring and nonsensical why is every actor in the movie crying all the time? why does mm mumblewhisper all his lines? i felt no emotional connection to any of the characters and didnt care if they lived or died i heard this was an amazing movie and was looking forward to seeing it but the only thing amazing about it is how much money and talent was turned into such a big steaming pile of dog excrementthis is it these parody films and wannabe spy genre films has got to stop because this is what ruins the original franchise and makes fun of it shame on these people i cannot even dream about someone making fun of sean connery and his bond but people did it the reason is no person on this earth is cool as him sean is not a actor but the definition of man itself period however this film makes fun of pierce brosnan 007 era films with exploding pens and gadgets etc brosnan is a boss he redefined spy genre the makers of kingsman should be sued for this blasphemy i dont care if it is rated r or pg 13 i saw this film and i got angry specially with sir samuelljackson i lost respect for him i mean how is this classic method actor can do this film from pulp fiction to pure pg 13 garbage stuff i got exited when i saw him being funny but by the time climax came his death scene is the funniest moment in the entire film he was embarrassing himself just what the hell is going on these days is hollywood running out of ideas they have same story lines over and over again repeating same thing million times what is wrong with these people kids with guns using bad language and violence for no reason even killing animals what a shameful era we are living in let me clear this up a bit this is not a snuffporn or exploitation film filled with sex but even those have some bloody standard at least they are serious about it and makers know what they are making but this one is nonsense mathew vaughn made just one good film in his life probably his last best too it is called layer cake with daniel craig check that out guys if you have not but avoid this crap please the plot let us look at the plot here it goes as a spy agency hires kids so they can battle evil villains who are about to destroy the world oh please why drag kids and teens into this kids already ruined wrestling attitude era this is coming from a 90s kid batista and john cena acts in lame movies too because they still aim it for kids ala guardians of galaxy etc parents are proud of it but the hypocrisy is that people hate kristen stewart and dakota fanning when they do goo serious dramatic films special vfxcgi effectsgore goes useless the dialogs are so cheesy it makes cartoon network looks like history channel this is high time minus point this film looses it people are asking for a refund me too but who will listen if films like these are still coming out whatever this is hollywood or british production it is the direction sucked big time so my question with critics and people is how dare all of you hate john wooang lee & ridley scott these guys are legends and their movies are gold hey even a tinto brass movie is better then kingsman any day colin firth was crazy for cash yes there are some hot sexy women here but wasted for people who want a great spy film watch mi22000 or for comedy try rush hour 2 as for action go back and try drunken master or matrix trilogy even but stay way from this guys dont believe the hype critics are blind i am waiting for bad boy 3 michael bay will show these kids how real action is done overall kingsmanthe secret service 2015 is the worst film of 2015 my rating is 110skipp it save your money & time please i have wasted minethis is by far the worst movie of 2014 character development doesnt exists in this movie nor any interesting dialogs or any real suspense moments the plot is dragging way too long and doesnt reach any climax if the film would have been 90 minutes long instead of 170 it could have been less of a torture the film score is irritating and dull which suits the banal script just fine i dont remember when was the last time i left the theater so angry and bored before watching this movie just stay away from this banal piece of nothingthis is an attempt at giving sleeping beauty the wicked treatment tries and fails dismally first of all the magic kingdom is fantastic with lots of bright cgi forest dwelling folk frittering around the screen this will be enough for most small children to get their moneys worth above that this film is awful the plot does not work on any level now i know this is a childrens fairy tale no one is rewriting shawshank here but the story is so awful it is insulting to the intelligence of infants basically the producer has gone down a check list of standard movie elements so we need a flying scene a battle scene a magic forest a princess check check  check check then at the last minute someone remembered they had to hammer the whole thing into an alternate sleeping beauty small children will be entertained by the graphics adults will be dumb founded by the unnecessary moronic story i was left wondering  given the true turn of events  who is propagating the version of sleeping beauty we all know anyway?this is a truly awful movie that cannot be related to on any level a total waste of a famous cast what an absurd story a dying man uploads his mind onto a computer then some nonsensical fighting ensues between those who are for and against such things johnny depp doesnt need to do such bad movies stoned faced performance by the way rebecca hall too unattractive for the lead female morgan freeman needs to display some selectiveness cillian murphy and paul bettany dont know what you were fighting for this type of bad sci fi rubbish has got to stop it deserves to be forgotten like it was never made at all makes inception seem logical by comparisonthis is a true zombie fest the undead have made a television show and to underline this i ask the question does anyone ever stay dead on this show? i mean how would we know anyway? i imagine if i was a zombie this would be the show to try out for or perhaps as the show runner or as a writerswooden stumbling desperate i suppose if youre watching this on tv the commercials would come as a relief or perhaps the zombies are holding families of the writers hostage and making them write this show makes sure the most wooden actors possible are cast or the best actors at acting really badly again its on netflix which is usually a pretty good sign that it will be pretty awfulthis is a formal request to matt damon matthew mccougnehey christopher nolan and the rest of the people behind this movie to give me three hours of my life back i warn anyone that is considering to watch this movie dont this movie is riddled with plot holes a storyline that is so formulaic and predictable that it borders on something a 5th grader could have wrote if you watch the first 20 minutes of the movie the rest of the movie you will just be waiting for the stuff that you know will happen to happen there is little room for surprise and even less room for enjoyment adding to this the visuals in the movie are a huge problem in watching it i got a headache and motion sickness so not only was i left with a feeling of wasted time after leaving the cinema i also felt physically ill i feel the actors in this movie are all outside their comfort zones and the acting feels very forced and it feels like not even the actors in the movie want to be a part of it i would recommend this movie to anyone that enjoyed the room with tommy wiseau or gigli with ben affleck and jennifer lopez because i think we have a new winner in the unwatchable movie hall of fame interstellarthis has got to be the most overrated show in the history of tv series the idea at the beginning of this show was great but the character of oliver is awful how can the writers let this be like that? did they ever read the comics? oliver queen was a joyful character with a lot of jokes that was special about him that even if he lost a lot he still had the power to smile and make funny jokes all of this just makes the show bad from the start instead we see a robot with no personality that falls in love with anyone anytime season 1 was ok but it was obvious that it was mediocre at best and that was written by people who knew nothing about writing a good screenplay the worst part was that they kept that my name is oliver queen thing and previously on arrow although every episode apart from the season finale had no connection what so ever with the other episodes except the characters another bad thing was the obvious made up as the show went on thing the writers were always changing the story so that the story on the island could fit and be the same like the one from the present it just doesnt feel right and this cant be just a coincidence probably the best argument for this would be the episode from season 2 when oliver caught sarah and the first thing he remembered was how she drown with the yacht in the beginning of season 1 really? shouldnt he remember the last thing that happened between them that got sarah killed can no one else see that? are the writers so stupid to contradict themselves always when they need to introduce someone new to the show the finale was stupid stupid seeing at the end that oliver was transported in hong kong from the island and somehow he made it back really? am i supposed to buy this? i can guess that at the end of third season there will be another person like amanda that comes and take oliver back to the island or some place else thats just obvious made up on the way people about the mirakuru i have nothing to say except another contradiction a very convenient coincidence that on the island oliver had a cure and in real world he had again a cure for slade it just feels stupid that all the show is centered about oliver making choices between right and wrong its just like a propaganda next when slade soldiers were encountered first by oliver he couldnt even hurt them but in the end he fights them like they are usual people although detective lance was seriously injured by one of those thugs how can no one see this contradictions in the show? are they so well hidden or only the brainless are watching the show right now probably because there are few votes for each episode and only high ones from those who think the show is good but in reality people with brain left the show a long time ago if the writers want to make a link between the present days and slade from the island why cant they show something else and then in season 3 or four show how slade got injected and became so bad watch lost and see how some things are left unresolved and then the writers show how everything happened and surprise you but here there is no surprise you know that oliver did something to upset slade and youre just expecting that bad bad and bad i have nothing to say about this stupid show that had potential but it was destroyed by stupid writers in the future if you want to see a good hero movietv series watch one that portrays well the comics and is real in what can it be like the dark knight trilogy the writers from this show decided to destroy another show the flash and i strongly recommend that you dont watch that either 110 totally awfulthis had a lot going for it a charismatic willing star who could really carry off a fantastic character a juicy betrayal to get the tale going and a lot of great special effects but unfortunately you cant stop there story pacing supporting cast winning characters? oops Ê we blew the budget with ajs wings and the cgi so so  is it a spoiler to say that the plot pretty much goes nowhere and that by the end you are so dying for it to be over you dont even care what happens?? if good conflict is what drives a good narrative does the absence of any good conflict  very much the case with this plodding slackly handled drearathon  make a bad one? the worst thing about this which leaves quite a bad taste in your mouth is that in redeeming the character of maleficent they decide to depict that she wasnt a mean old spinster she was a deeply loving maternal figure who was just bitter cuz she got royally screwed over by a guy she trusted its so schmaltzy its kitsch im a guy and this stuff offends my paltry feminism considering some of the takenoprisoners characters that aj plays and plays well i am surprised she even took this part but i suspect it was doing a screen test with the kudu horns on i might have even taken the part just to wear those oh and this movie at press time had a 71 rating i mean come on i know this is more or less a kids movie but a good kids movie is good so we can just go ahead and say that a bad kids movie is bad just take a similar movie enchanted  which had great songs a fantastic cast a charming funny sweet and complex story it is rated at 72this had a lot going for it a charismatic willing star who could really carry off a fantastic character a juicy betrayal to get the tale going and a lot of great special effects but unfortunately you cant stop there story pacing supporting cast winning characters? oops ‹ we blew the budget with ajs wings and the cgi so so  is it a spoiler to say that the plot pretty much goes nowhere and that by the end you are so dying for it to be over you dont even care what happens?? if good conflict is what drives a good narrative does the absence of any good conflict  very much the case with this plodding slackly handled drearathon  make a bad one? the worst thing about this which leaves quite a bad taste in your mouth is that in redeeming the character of maleficent they decide to depict that she wasnt a mean old spinster she was a deeply loving maternal figure who was just bitter cuz she got royally screwed over by a guy she trusted its so schmaltzy its kitsch im a guy and this stuff offends my paltry feminism considering some of the takenoprisoners characters that aj plays and plays well i am surprised she even took this part but i suspect it was doing a screen test with the kudu horns on i might have even taken the part just to wear those oh and this movie at press time had a 71 rating i mean come on i know this is more or less a kids movie but a good kids movie is good so we

mi movie was bad enough as it was now that we are on mi 12 or something like that it just makes it worse most puzzling is that many of the actors in this movie have done great movies thus i have to wonder were they improving in this piece of crap? was de palma just like meh f*ck it let the special effects guys write this garbage dont get me wrong tom cruise is an awful actor anyway but christ it was a socalled all star lineup if it wasnt touted to this day as a good movie i wouldnt comment but this sh*t will not end kill it already in my opinion if you havent seen this movie consider yourself luckythis film sucked on every level imaginable from the script the acting the sound track the physics the cinematography the directing the editing the flow the lack of transition the script the acting the sound track the physics the cinematography    oops  my keyboard momentarily slipped into a transdimensional time altering state of flux that actually made more sense than anything about the film interstellar actually the film sucked with a force far greater than any gravitational pull exerted by a black hole that it literally pulled any intelligence out of the minds of the films viewers thereby destroying any rational or true cognitive ability to make a sound review of this really really really great film i want my mommy   this film is tripe synonyms  cheese crapola dreck muck rubbish sleaze slop slush trash related words  camp kitsch claptrap humbug nonsense bomb clinker clunker dud lemon stinker turkey mess muddle shambles the one good thing about this movie is that it made me want to view stanley kubricks 2001 a space odyssey again not even imax saves this film and an 89 rating here is proof that hollywood owns imdb youll be better of getting your reviews from rotten tomatoes because this movie isnt at all fresh christopher nolan you had me with inception but you lost me here please leave the blockbuster drama to steven spielberg and the planetary sci fi to ridley scott & james cameron thanksthis film is mostly just a video game without the controller there wasnt enough of the story to explain who the characters were it just jumps right in the scenes and dialogue happen very fast the villain was yet another classic villain who only does things because hes the bad guy and he likes dark places and wears spooky clothing because hes evil there is another villain who shows up in the movie who is presented as being badder than the main villain but then never shows up again this made no sense the characters rocket and groot added a little humor here and there as well as the other main characters but thats pretty much what all of the movie was there was no real sense of danger because at every twist and turn the heroes would solve it within five minutes or whatever even very very very big spaceships with giant laser beams approaching a planet felt like no danger because it always seemed that the heroes could handle it this is the problem with most action movies nowadays every thing in it is made to be epic and amazing movie viewers all around the world are constantly being shown movies with things that are specifically made to be epic and amazing that incredible cgi and other special effects begin to seem mediocre and they get used to it so much that nothing seems to amaze anyone anymore because every action movie is made in that way theres no more star wars kind of effects on audiences where they are thrilled by something new and creative this movie is mostly just a big show to dazzle spectators with special effects that you have to look very carefully to find any good storytelling in the film there has to be a balance between good story telling and good cgi in a film like this but instead this film is nothing but constant cgi explosions and cheesy oneliners that we begin to forget what the story is or why things are happening however the plot was extremely simple the villain had no sense of having a specific reason why he wanted to rule the galaxy all the characters are introduced too fast that we dont get used to them or relate to them the movie is like watching a video gamethis film is an antiintellectual zenith it is offensive at least for someone who has a rudimentary knowledge of astrophysics and the theory of relativity i have never seen such sf movie full of nonsense at least in the last 20 years every single law of physics is broken or adjusted to hollywood pulp ethical problems concerning time travel were already discussed 60 years ago medeagaia hypothesis is an old fairy tale pseudo philosophical use of feelings with respect to the multidimensional timespace is simply ridiculous situations that occur in the vicinity of the event horizon i can only say serious case of ignorance and standard use moral treatise about human nature based on common sense is too obvious someone who makes movies based on comic books shouldnt be allowed to make a sf movie really bad choice i am disappointed very disappointed 1 point is for the robots best regardsthis film glorifies sodomy it mentions global warming as if its a real thing it implies strongly that margaret thatcher was not a positive political figure it portrays christians as lunatics worthy of slaughter the foul language is so gratuitous that one has to wonder if the filmmakers think its clever or what point it is theyre trying to make by taking that road there are no heroes or any sort of virtuous characters to latch onto the plot is full of holes i could go on but suffice it to say that this is lowgrade filmmaking and a waste of everyones time my wife and i both disliked it and wish we had our afternoon backthis dreary  boring  depressing  and overly long scifi flick is about the dying earth and the last desperate attempts to repopulate another world with human beings  unless you are stephen hawking or neil degrasse tyson or you possess a degree in quantum physics  thermodynamics  time warps  black holes and worm holes you will not understand all of the technical jargon the viewer is constantly bombarded with  to make matters worse matthew mcconaughey is probably the best mumbler in hollywood  i did not understand a single line that came out of his face  anyway the great dust bowl of the 1930s has returned to wreck havoc on the world only this time it really means business  matthew mcconaughey  the worlds greatest astronaut turned farmer  is chosen to be the earths savior  his interstellar space craft endurance is capable of traveling through the vastness of space and time  it is also armored like a battleship that can withstand explosions  collisions  and a gigantic tsunami wave 1000 feet high  anne hathaway is the cryogenics expert  she looks a lot more convincing playing catwoman than the endurances genius co astronaut  this movie is quite confusing for the average movie goer with an iq of under 140 to comprehend  interstellar is gloomy and awful and definitely not worthy of your two and a half hours  i would recommend george pals 1951 scifi classic  when worlds collide  over this boring and lifeless piece of space junk   not hot pwhthis does contain a spoiler one that if i would have known i wouldnt have wasted my time or money i dont like to even watch trailers on movies because i want no preconception of how a movie is going to be this movie has single handily changed 30+ years of thinking i thought the story was very well written and acted despite almost always knowing what the twists were going to be until the pace was so slow and could have been compressed into a normal 7585 minute movie my guess is that the reason there was no ending was because they ran out of time for dragging it on like they did when the credits hit the entire audience i was with pretty much let out a stream of obscenities and we all felt like the producersdirectorsstudio all just gave us two middle fingers i could have dealt with the slow pace if they would have just wrapped up the moviethis back show is terrible they have the spoiled rich boy coming back to take vengeance on the evil rich friends of his parents which plays well to the obamaera class warfare but little else the core seems to be if you got rich you did evil to get there really? he cant fight crime he has to be on this vendetta crusade? plus there is the whole thing of the constant flashbacks to his life on the island brought in every episode couldnt just tell us the back story in one episode? this is such a disappointment after smallville was brought to the network i had a hard time watching it bad scripts bad plots and acting that would do 1966 william shatner proud all top this offthey stole the entire movie from orlando corradis version of cinderella which was fantabulous creation i never knew they were such cheats guys do check out orlando corradis anime version of cinderella and youll know all theyve got whole storyline running from there its just that its not an animation this time orlando corradis version is really old one they needed peoples attention and praises so cheated whole thing from someone else how cheap isnt it? corradi is no more i guess but still i think his works are worth an applause maybe its just because am a big fan of animes but this is too much never ever gonna watch this disneys version i feel bad for corradithere is something deeply unsettling about sitting in a movie theater surrounded by people who are laughing as on screen heads are exploding limbs are being hacked off and a princess rewards her rescuer with anal sex the film starts out on a promising and engaging note as we follow the recruitment and training of the protagonist but then at about the midway point things get terribly weird and weirdly terrible this is not just movie violence but violenceporn violence for laughs violence that glories in being shocking and over the top the movie itself in terms of filmcraft is disposable and forgettable but what sticks with me is a nagging feeling that what ive just watchedin the guise of a movie purportedly about a refined british spy agencyis a marker of the decline of western civilization kingsman is the roman circus for the 21st century and every bit as brutal and pointlessthere is nothing good about this movie the television show had a format this movie takes the name of the show but does not follow the format at all the television show was fun but this movie is slow and boring and has no likeable characters i do not know why they even bothered to name it after the television showthere is no way on earth that these positive reviews are real this was hands down the worst movie experience of my life it made shark boy and lava girl seem like a masterpiece both of these movies were seen at the urging of the same sonalbeit almost a decade apart i cannot believe i ruined date night with my wife over this 3 hour hellfest i alternated between scratching my head holding back laughing wanting to yell out jokes about lincoln commercials and not being able to hold back laughing based on the looks from everyone else as they were leaving the theater we all shared the same sentiments go ahead blow $10 on this miserable ridiculous implausible pile of poopy that would make m night shamalyan scream out you have got to be friggin kidding me at the movies attempts at plot twiststhere have been too many versions of the movie cinderella and this modern version was so disappointing indeed it is made for kids only and not for adults the movie was so boring walt disney pictures did not offer anything new in this dull and outdated sequel the remake was much worse than copy and pastea lot of imitation of cinderella movies and nothing original walt disney stole all the ideas and movie plot from orlando corradi see orlando corradis cinderella movie and see the shocking evidence how disney is clever in rip off & theft the acting is so tasteless see the original version and avoid this imitated versionthere box in the book i dont why it was even in there i just added more confusion next her hair cut was awful  i know fault in our stars she couldve kept the wig from the beginning of the movie next they barely include side characters  christina hector etc  dont expect anything from the book jeanine doesnt get killed by evelyn but by tori what is sad is that peter and eric were my actors then all start randomly running towards the fence after as if they are all gonna get out  which doesnt happen  then the jeanines army randomly go in amity in the beginning with barely any marcus evelyn standing on the side stalking four  it is a good movie if u havent read the book but if u reach the book you are screwedthere are so many to list but they are so obvious and stupid that the suspension of disbelief is totally gone nano bots so small they are in the air and rain yet to be infected these people must be touched? ridiculous everyone in the entire area would be breathing them nano bots repair tissue heal skin restore eyesight? okay that is futuristic and believable main facility loses power and they are no longer getting healed okay i suppose the nanobots need some form of power but the previously healed revert back the blind man goes blind again? ridiculous he was already healed why do the fallen wounded float up to standing like some silly paranormal phenomenon? stupid effects that are so out of place and ruin the moment over and over again this movie was a complete poosandwich and the fact they gross over $100m is tantamount to theftthere are people out there who can write a half decent script and dont get the opportunity to ever have it heard there are people out there who have serious acting skill and never get seen there are scifi movies that have an original story that dont have a budget to be released at their full potential support people with talent and original ideas do not see guardians of the galaxy as it contains nothing that vaguely resembles any of those things congratulations on nailing the cgi though guys that was great if i felt like staring at great cgi for two and a half hours though id play call of dutythen this will be an amazing show if on the other hand you set your own standards and can read beyond the 9th grade level well youll find the dialog premise and sensationalism just too void of all reality and sensibility the characters interaction with one another is very one dimensional and monotone its like theyre robots with the single emotion of despair the male characters conversational scenes all have that iloveyou innuendo much like smallville supernatural and most any show that has been produced by the cw or the people involved in these shows the only thing missing from the homosexual innuendo is the scenes followed up by glorified anal sex the dialog is just outrageously terrible as if everything in these characters lives is emotionally draining and just having a simple normal human conversation is beyond their coping abilities every conversation is a scene of coping its just so manipulative in an attempt to get the consumer deeply empathizing with the characters and creating a very unhealthy unnatural emotional attachment to fantasy rather then finding these needs within their real relationships every show on cw does this and i truly see the fate of our species being quite dire as the consequence sure its your fault for watching but just as much theirs for making it available the action varies from awesome to stupid we have the nonsensical flipping spinning acrobatic maneuvers that would get you killed along with a man with a bow and arrow out gunning 12 men with fully automatic weapons that never seem to run out of bullets how is that good entertainment? its just the same crap ive been seeing since i was 8 years old that became increasingly stupid to me starting at about the age of 15 it went from well i am watching for the outrageous unbelievable fantasy action film or show to why am i still watching this crap? its a lot of money to deliver us the same nonsense were used to theyre exploiting the immaturity of the current generation who has decided to let the world set their standards and assume that since everyone else is going along for the ride their standards must be high i just see no point in taking the action style of hercules legendary journeys and giving it a bigger budget and more takes so the editors can churn out something suitable for prime time face it youre a bunch of half wits with pathetically low standards if youre over the age of 16 and think this is an awesome show its a show for children teenage girls and middle aged women like most of cws programmingthe writing for this series is beyond simplistic and is heavy handed which coincidentally aligns perfectly with the amateurish direction and phenomenally bad acting david ramsey puts in the best performances which should speak volumes about the stink quality of the other actors the cgi quality is laughable video games have better effects for petes sake the editing of the fight sequences at times look as if a live actor is fighting a blue screen and the foes are edited in later and rather poorly at that then it looks as if frames are removed to make the action appear faster the result is the arrow is fighting a bit out of phase with the other combatants and the action looks choppy as well two episodes in and i cant imagine this hopeless dreck surviving a complete season even on a twobit channel like the cwthe visuals were wonderful and that is about all i can say that was good about this film either the men were without members or were brutish bastages that were the cause of all the problems it started out good but why is it that there has to be a different take on a film or story just to outright slander defile and degrade men? i tried to like it but i see this trend in a lot of movies today women can be pure evil in their own right without the help of a man i was really hoping that elle fanning would shine in this film but she was mind numbingly dull the three fairies were stupid the prince should not even have been in the film if he was not going to save her with a kiss the true loves kiss part was wickedly betrayed by what only another woman can give even if she is not the girls mother is this what you want your daughter to think about men in general?the universe is full of fascinating facts its mindbending to contemplate for example the awesome size of our galaxy light travels 186000 miles per second and yet it takes 100000 years for a single beam of light to cross the entire milky way galaxy and our galaxy to quote carl sagan is only one among billions and billions the vastness of space truly is stunning but thanks to a worm hole the folks in interstellar leave the milky way in a cosmic snap of the fingers and yet having just achieved this most amazing of all feats our heroes are pretty much bored to tears instead everybody is more concerned with some fatherdaughter relationship that wasnt developed in the first place look if youre going to make a movie that purports to explore the fascinating mysteries of the universe then do it have some wonderment in the story dazzle me not only with visuals but with amazement at the astonishing scope of our universe and why not produce a script that obeys the laws of astrophysics or at least some theories thereof? this movie takes something that would dwarf the apollo lunar missions and turns it into some ridiculous plan aplan b tediousness i suggest instead watching through the wormhole with morgan freeman or re watching 2001 a space odyssey heck even contact with jodie foster is far more entertaining and imaginative than interstellar and yet  92 stars im not saying 10star reviews on this site are phony after all major film critics also are raving about interstellar unfortunately i find most professional film critics about as credible as the physics in this movie frankly interstellar is a boring movie and if that puts me in the vast minority of reviewers fine i can live with that because i have minimum standards when i pay $11 for admission and $850 for large popcorn stay home and read a good book instead or just gaze out at the night sky and reflect on our amazing universethe trailers had me anticipating something like early james bond as a super hero this movie made the characters look like jokes the obviously sped up fight scenes looked stupid and omg samuel jackson looked ridiculous dressed like a skater punk besides the fact that it was totally outside the atmosphere that the movie was supposedly creating it is just sad for samuel jackson i get why the studios might want to hide the fact that he is almost 70 and looks more like 90 these days sean connery had the good sense to age gracefully instead of foolishly and jackson or his handlers should try that other than that what i can tell you about the movie without spoilers is limited  it is an action movie that i suppose is about as good as most in the genre but it could have been more it seemed to be an attempt to create a new mythical hero in the kingsman and i believe that was a failure it was unclear why these people existed as chaos and death seemed even more likely with them than without them kingsman is a poor myth because it does not seem to have any purpose other than its own glorification thats hollywood i guess but i hoped for morethe trailer looked incredibly stupid but i went anyway for the positive reviews for the duration i couldnt shake the fact that everything i was seeing i had already seen many times before and that this film had nothing new to offer gotg lacks an ounce of anything it can call its own and so succeeds almost purely on sentimentality for the 80s from which it took most of the scenes mid showing i walked out to make a phone call i almost walked back in to finish the film but decided that nothing in the second half could justify the lack of story character wit or creativity that the first half utterly lacked fortunately i saw it alone so i didnt have to deal with the social pressure to stay if you see this then i would recommend the early matine discountthe trailer looked incredibly stupid but i went anyway for the positive

social pressure to stay if you see this then i would recommend the early matin_e discountthe story was initially promising but after mission start of the film had unfortunately many lengths it would have been better to put this place 2h 3h the whole film has somehow worked very pieced together  the scifi ideas were sometimes quite ok but not consistent in star trek z b the makers have previously carefully considered to create a coherent picture to in this film here it creates the rocket spaceship with his ridiculous drive to escape the pull of the black hole  the special effects were on the level of 90 years  since ive been hoping for much more i went because of the extremely good reviews on imdb in this film and am just disappointed the script is predictable and badly executed acting is lame the trailer is misleading the characters and the plot did not click with me at all the cgi effects are awful not believable there in logic in the movie it is more like zombie movie if you want to see something nice with a nice sense of humor and the actual interesting plot then please do not watch this you will definitely be wasting your time what you get here is that you know the end of the first 5 minutes i mean come on the fight will be accepted in high society and movies about it was a hit 30 years ago if you have the money or you are a smart man you will be welcomed throughout the world this is really poor movie avoid this crapthe reviews score here made me look forward to watching this movie but what a disappointment it was i am seriously wondering what is wrong with todays audience when a movie like this get such good reviews maybe its just a wrong idea of science fiction maybe people label budget fantasy movies science fiction ? anyway lets have a quick look at some of the bad point of this movie first the lead actor i dont know how he is perceived in the us but looking with an european view mcconaughey is just plain horrible at acting he has no facial expressions and talks english with a slow slur that is really annoying then later on in the movie i see a good actor like topper grace and wonder what the casting director thought when shehe hired mcconaughey there is just no emotional connection between him and any of the other characters even when he cries it feels like someone just drop some vaseline over his face and he just sits there waiting till its lunch again mcconaughey should be a car salesman not an actor then there is the pace of this slow moving epic we spend god knows how many hours in some dust bowl house where people stare outside and drive in pickup trucks with high technology equipment to bring down indian drones for using their solar panels to probably power an old play station 3 i kid you not the way the lead manages to find the secret nasa base is laughable there is a base with literally hundreds of people working there in the middle of a field without the huge parking lot for all their pickups trucks remember earth is dying so everyone has a v8 pickup to find indian drones then there is the so called science in the movie apparently they even hired a professor to help them with the science part well dear professor please join mcconaughey as a car salesman as you dont have one clue about science and if the audience thinks the movie is using it i have a bad feeling about the future of our species the radiation the fact that they walk about on a planet with sun light orbiting a black hole where we have so much gravity that every hour there is 7 years on earth and even the same for the station they left orbiting just 200 miles up is just one silly example of course mcconaughey has no problems with relativity time shifts once he enters the black hole of course how could he otherwise meet up with his dying daughter to make a real american ending to this disaster of a movie then there is the robot made for a budget movie looking so cheap and probably assembled from cardboard with aluminum foil  as you can see it almost bobbing about in the wind two obligatory lcd panels show scrolling text as the robot talks and stumbles about that robot sets the level for the special effects they look cheap  badly filmed from the perspective of the space ship most of the time as if they had some plastic contraption with a gopro attached to it handled by a 12 year old going bzzzzzzz as he moves it about yes its that bad there are many bad movies around and this is just one of them but what baffles me is why this piece of overlong budget fantasy gets so many good reviews did the people here not see other movies ever ? did they miss alien gravity or even star wars not that the last one is science fiction but at least its entertaining and this was not hoping hollywood wakes up at some point and starts making movies again with depth and science instead of cheap fantasy aimed at  yeah what is the target audience for this and mcconaughey please leave the movie industry and join the nearest chevy dealerthe reason im writing this review is because i was told it an amazing movie etc etc however i would advise you all to not waste your time mathew mcconeghey is an excellent actor no doubt but in this movie i find him mumbling and its hard to understand what hes saying the storyline is completely unbelievable it does not make sense in the least its a really big stretch of the imagination and lets not forget matt damons role im still trying to figure out why he would play such an insignificant and antagonistic role opposite mathew mcconeghey as far as the graphics go i watched it in imax and though the special effects are cool in imax its not worth the 2 hrs of your time basicallyyoull walk out of there googling almost every phrase you heard dont say no one warned you the problem with kingsman the secret service is that it cant decide whether its a spy movie or a movie about violent killers or a comedy it tries to do some of all three it partially succeeds as a spy movie owing a lot to old james bond films and did anyone catch the reference to get smart? and granted there are a few funny moments but the violence overwhelms everything else theres plenty of gratuitous killing and its not the least bit subtle if thats your cup of tea prepare to have a great time for me i think the story would be have been better if 90% of the fight scenes had been left on the cutting room floor plotwise its completely predictable a few minutes into the movie we can already guess which two characters would end up in a fight to the finish at the end very mild spoiler alert the movie ends with the audience essentially being mooned thanks a lot guys id gladly return the favor if i knew you were watching one last point some user reviews have complained that the fword is used quite a bit it is but really is that the most offensive thing here? the entire premise of the dastardly project and the implication that almost every world leader mindlessly buys into it is far worse not to mention the almost nonstop display of blood and guts some of the killings are presented in an almost comical way and neednt be taken seriously but most of it is just grossly and needlessly excessivethe plot in the near future earth has been devastated by drought and famine causing a scarcity in food and extreme changes in climate when humanity is facing extinction a mysterious rip in the spacetime continuum is discovered giving mankind the opportunity to widen its lifespan a group of explorers must travel beyond our solar system in search of a planet that can sustain life the crew of the endurance are required to think bigger and go further than any human in history as they embark on an interstellar voyage into the unknown coop the pilot of the endurance must decide between seeing his children again and the future of the human race nasas version of sophies choice its a horrible movie and i am shocked anyone likes it firstly it doesnt get moving until nearly an hour into this crapola by then most us us have checked out and have no interest the plot is idiotic and not even marginally based in the realm of scientific possibility i genuinely hated this moviethe only two things that i liked  a few pictures of prague and some more of emmanuelle bart two things of great beauty the story is completely unbelievable there are a lot of errors and a lot of unnecessary complications truly impossible but not in any way i expectedthe only two things that i liked  a few pictures of prague and some more of emmanuelle b_art two things of great beauty the story is completely unbelievable there are a lot of errors and a lot of unnecessary complications truly impossible but not in any way i expectedthe only thing worth seeing in this movie is the cgi it is beautifully done although i found the 3 fairies quite disturbing looking creatures and thus very unsettling i would give it an 8 for the cgi but the movie well thats quite another story they havent respected the classic the original story if so maleficent would be evil the original is a story of good vs evil right vs might and a lesson that love conquers all but rather than that simple formula this is a story of a jiltedbetrayed lover who seeks revenge through an innocent child to me that is not respecting the original story and it didnt bring us what we love about this story it isnt a different but classic fairy tale the formula for a classic fairy tale is that there are no muddled lines between good and evil this one muddles all the way through i didnt see anything in this movie that was even remotely reminiscent of the original only the names and the spindle it was just a dark and horrible story i wouldnt bring my kids to see it this isnt a lesson of goods triumph over evil this is some sort of warped tale of psychological excuses for bad or deviant behavior instead of teaching children right is right and wrong is wrong it teaches that wrong can be right just so long as the person doing wrong thinks its fair or even worse cant be helped this antihero worship mentality is not what any child needs and is the ruin of our society lets root for the bad guy lets understand the bad guy the bad guy is the hero no one is truly bad everyone who does evil has a backstory that made them that way pity the refuse of society the things they do are either learned or they were born that way but either way they are justified or cant help it we should never blame or judge anyones behavior as truly bad because they must have a reason for being this way that could not be avoided dont blame me others actions made me do it i am right in whatever i do when i feel i have been wronged two wrongs dont make it right it makes it fair everything is excusable so long as i can think of an excuse so first she is right to want revenge and then she was right for trying to undo it and then she was right to defend herself it would seem she is always right regardless because right is perceived and judged against the emotion of the day so long as she felt it was right at the time she was never wrong no matter what she was doing she was always right she was just a victim of some selfish man men are putzes and men are evil show me one decent male role model in this story her companion was a weak tool governed by her his apparent feminine side was his only saving grace the prince was just a pretty face shallow and likely governed by his hormones the king was a user a phony governed by his greed the message here is women dont need men men are motivated and controlled by their lusts and women are motivated by their heart and purest emotions women should be strong and not be fooled by a mans affections when people do bad it must have been for a good reason and really isnt wrong of them bad behavior doesnt warrant our anger or judgement but begs our understanding and compassion any attempt at a classic good vs evil concept only seems to appear in this movie in the vein of women being good and strong vs men being evil and weak to conclude this story somehow meant to convey that love conquers all is a sham this movie is pure feminist and thug raising tripe this movie is unfit for children no beauty appears in this dark tale alas it must have been sleepingi am certain mr walt disney is rolling over in his grave again and again over stuff like this this totally destroyed the disney original it basically told every viewer flat out you were lied to the first story was just a pack of lies your parents told you they have been lying about maleficent for ages poor maleficent evil parents what other lies have your parents told you? santa? the easter bunny? how dare they make you believe in fictitious characters and happily ever afters they dont exist bad is good and good is bad and everything your parents try to tell you is a lie mr disney would have never done that and certainly never would have approved fantasies hopes dreams imaginations and the innocence of children was to be protected and encouraged at all coststhe one is because the high score the movie is not that terrible and some entertainment value maybe a 410 is more appropriate i found ben affleck acting was quite bad i didnt care much about any of the characters but maybe the lead investigator but not much time is actually spent on the police work anyway the plot is just to impossibleincredible and the twists are just too convenient and stupid ultimately you dont really care about what is happening because the husband character is flat and ben seems completely disconnected with the events that happen to him he seems to not give 2 s**** why would he have married this psycho without noticing anything? i dont know and i dont carethe name of the movie couldnt be better mission impossible because it was impossible of watching this is a very boring action film i hoped something better because the 2 tv series the nineties one and the sixties one were two great tv series but this movie man it was boring as hell i dont know how i didnt fall sleep in the middle of the movie it could be more boring? tom cruise in one of his worst performances not only him everyone in the movie were so lame the plot itself have no sense so this is my review one of the most boring films i have seen in my life i give it 110the mumbled and unintelligible dialogue lost me for the first ten minutes but i gave it a second chance as the mystery developed the boring characters were just about bearable as the plot began to twist and turn but affleck and pike were so cold and mysterious even with each other that it was hard to like either of them so where was your emotional engagement here? only margo was remotely interesting this film also had some of the least erotic and downright odd sex scenes ever filmed this was a film of two parts the first part ran through all the clichs of the detective thriller but we were cheated in the second part when the villainess inexplicably got away with it in agatha christie books when the killer makes a mistake and has a sudden change of plans this is usually their undoing as things planned for the original crime stand out like sore thumbs in the adapted scenario then they get caught end of story in this particular tale it was the diary why would desi have taken it to a house he didnt know existed and fail to burn it properly when he could have burnt it in seconds in the fire at the crime scene ? the cops would have seen through that in seconds and then the rest of her contradictions would have unravelled what about the attempted purchase of an illegal gun ? the purchase of the car the credit card purchases of the electronic toys the puppets the treasure hunt clues ? none of which could be attributed to desi so someone else must have organised or staged them and just who was supposed to have tipped off the cops to the woodshed ? all non  sequetors that made no sense in the end columbo would have had her in the slammer long before the final reel but the cops just let her off  the non  examination by the medics of the blood covered pike was utterly ridiculous this hospital must miss lots of wounds as they simply dont look for them dont let me get taken to this sloppy hospital if i get run over  she would have had none of the injuries from the initial kidnapping but a mysterious venepuncture wound on her arm both of which would have lead the cops once again to think the kidnapping had been staged we also got treated to homages to fatal attraction and the hand that rocked the cradle were the female lead had to be totally insane not just confident and calculating this is the old male gaze all women are evil psychos drivel being rehashed for a new generation and we can do without itthe

rehashed for a new generation and we can do without itthe movie would be descent if it wasnt 3 hours long found myself and my friend begging for the ending so we could walk out the theater as we were somewhere in the middle of the row i love the concept but i think its too linear  no major twists in the story that could come from nowhere everything is so predictable and could be packed in a maximum of 100 minutes also the soundtrack was killing me throughout the whole movie too sad and without energy not moving enough i think that the soundtrack was there to kill any thrill you could enjoy watching this film the animations are 1010 but overall i was glad when i finally got out the theater so  110 is my final verdictthe movie was too long much to much scientific mumbo jumbo the special effects were a total let down saw it in imax not impressed the story had no speed very draggy performances were ok no oscars here the previews were the best part of the lure the middle was right out of 2001 space odyssey i have never been to a movie where so many people left about 2530 which was most of the crowd my daughter and i stuck it out hoping for some redemption but none came i should have seen it at a bargain matine very upset movie goer i know that this movie has gotten great reviews but really  take another look pleasethe movie was too long much to much scientific mumbo

none came i should have seen it at a bargain matin_e very upset movie goer i know that this movie has gotten great reviews but really  take another look pleasethe movie was recommended to me by a friend who saw the reviews and somehow believed those huge mistake to say the movie is childish would be an honor for this movie i have seen plenty of animated movies which were a huge lot better the story is dumb and entirely predictable the characters are almost flat and have absolutely no credibility from either a serious point of view nor from a parody point of view acting was also poor visual effects were ok and being a 3d movie helped but that is the only positive thing that i can say about the movie the theater was halffull but during the entire movie there was not a single time when you could hear everybody laughing hard the only way i can imagine that so many 9 and 10 star reviews were added for this movie is since all the brainwashed marvel fanboys and sockpuppets for the studios somehow managed to overwhelm normal reviewersthe movie was horrible i saw it because i was chaperoning four thirteen year old girls who were dying to see it the whole theater was full of a similar group sex and age subpar acting very idiotic main story a complete waste of time and money there is really no much more to be said perhaps i am not in the demographic for the book and movie i am over forty years old but i could not wait for it to finish to go home and spit the mouthful of puke i was holding please take my advise and spare yourself the suffering of this i sacrificed myself for you and i have come to advise you from your future not to fall as i didthe movie versions of mission impossible are complete crap that are nothing like the tv series the movie versions of mission impossible turned the tv shows hero jim phelps into a bad guy and made a character ethan hunt who wasnt even in the tv series into the hero of the movies it would be like making a movie adaptation of the ateam with colonel hannibal smith turning into a bad guy killing the rest of the team and then having a totally new character not in the tv series be the hero of the movie moreover the movie versions of mission impossible are just another action movie with fancy stunts and bigbudget explosions like the james bond movies the tv series wasnt about stunts and explosions the tv series was about cleverlydevised cloakanddagger plots to trick the bad guys into turning against each other the tv series was about outsmarting the bad guys with brains not beating the bad guys with brawn in fact there were probably less punches thrown during the entire two tv series than during the mission impossible movie the producers of the mission impossible movie just wanted a way to market tom cruise in an action movie with fancy gadgets and bigbudget explosions but there are so many of these similar movies that have already been made so they called it mission impossible to lure in fans of the old tv series if youre just looking for a bigbudget remake of a rambotype movie then go ahead and see this movie but if youre a fan of the mission impossible tv series then dont waste your time on this crap of a moviethe movie starts lengthy with building the plot base everyone knows from the trailer or movie description after five minutes i already feel out of breath but try hard to sit through the boring conversations and the obvious i need lots of chips and popcorn to endure this phase after the long wait in the middle of the movie i am rewarded with excellent cgi effects and technological advances that would make everybody saliva and handle over their money immediately in real life its easy to fall in love with this digital creature who comes up with such great ideas i was thinking open api would be l33t if will casters mission was to transcend i was waiting for him to commit to github i was waiting for great things in this movie but the movie clearly was not made for the educated masses but for a stubborn religious audience who likes all movies to be the same the plot turned sour but not unexpectedly the religious fanatics who want to play god and control everything on this planet team up to destroy the new intelligence with mortars they repeatedly attack the data center trying to destroy the new hope for the planet of course the few religious lunatics win by the most crazy means ever with a virus its beyond me how a supercluster ai intelligence does not have security all emotional attachment aside there should be security running as basic protocols in the background after all he was connected to the internet a dangerous place was the data center running on windows xp first edition ?? in the beginning of the movie the first thing will caster did after going digital was to rewrite his code base this is what everybody would have done  optimize code all the time after all its his natural state to be digital and to innovate therefore the virus was impossible to implement the code to compromise by max waters did not even exist anymore  we learned that after 20 minutes in how would will  as an intelligent being  not create his own programming language and complete code rewrite? how??? all in all a very disappointing piece of cgi bliss it makes me upset about the religious screenwriter who once again gives us the american nightmare its possible to kill all innovation with weapons and religious people will always rule and controlthe movie is not worth keep your kids from seeing this movie unless your want them to be disappointed and very confuse is a terrible change of something that was a beautiful master piece incredible to see and believe that the own owner of the sleeping beauty disney is destroying what everybody has come to love for generations i was very looking forward to see the movie since disney has a good record on movies although some of the last one has not been very good including this one but for example if you saw frozen you though disney is back to creativity and beautiful long lasting history that passed thru time this movie maleficent is not one of them you wont be attract to even repeat it nor less read it to your daughters as a bed time story maybe if disney management could use the imagination so much they promote to young ones they could it come up with a new history no one has ever heard before and could sell it but for what reason will disney corporation will destroy what is already a proving time after time years after years mom to girl princess to princess beautiful story where the prince rescue the princess the king father and queen mother love and protect their daughter and the bad witch lose and is destroy by the goodness and them the prince and princes leave happily ever after if only mr walt disney were alive to see of what his disney world has becomethe movie chronicles the journey of a group of astronauts traveling through space in search of a new planet on which to establish a new colony of humans due to the physics involved they remain young whilst their family back on earth grow old their entire journey lasts for about 60 years considering the high ratings i really expected this to be an epic movie in reality nothing happens it literally felt as though i was trapped in their tiny little space ship for 60 years the plot is based on complex theoretical concepts but in the end makes no sense whatsoever there is no action no romance no comedy no special effects and very little meaningful dialogue if anything the movie has more of a documentary feel to it the visuals were nothing special and the music reminded me of a superman movie from the early 80s i just didnt get itthe most retarded film ive seen so far with depp triumph of stupidity discreditation of science fruits of which we are using to better our lives each day a point that there is no life beyond human body is even more dumb a wife that should be in best traditions the first traitor of a man and a friend that is eager to kill you based on only his own assumptions also shocked the idea that a common way to act for people is to kill stuff first then think if i had options id love to send the script author to mars so he wont be able to share his idiotic primitive ideas never ever again after watching this movie i felt the upcoming depression from understanding that it was most likely targeted on the farmers popultaion of low educated people somewhere in albania that are living in darkness fear aggression and no hope not adviced to watched for people with iq > 90the most disappointing movie of 2015 so far i was looking forward to it since the divergent was pretty consistent with just a few awkward spots however insurgent i would call it complete trash with just one goal  earn money the visual effects were good except for those long shots being made just for the 3d  like the flying above the city in the end it looked so cheap the plot is predictable very slowboring most of the crucial moments are too shallow in their results the movie completely lacks logical structure  not sure if its written like this in the book too spoler alert how everyone is so ok not to guard a guy who had been an enemy just few moments ago? how would whole army get to the building without being noticed?the marvel team has once again given us another bunch of junk the ever growing marvel cinematic universe deserves to be destroyed and i found myself rooting for the bad guys to put the rest of the sappy characters out of their misery james gunn takes the helm of the fairly unknown guardians of the galaxy much to his detriment unlike iron man captain america and thor join this film as partners in grime an unmitigated disaster total junk a complete waste of time and utterly forgettable stay home and watch friends reruns they are more creative and still more relevant than this unimaginative unoriginal mishmash of plagiarized elements from other films ugghhhhthe main actor is as wooden as they come and looks ridiculous in every scene after the opening few seconds i knew it was going to be awful i saw a bad explosion effect and a man wearing a silly looking hood and an obviously fake beard in fact everyone looks ridiculous with bad make up and lighting the writing is painfully dull any attempts at humor are mind bogglingly unfunny the main character is highly unlikable and it is difficult to find anything with which to identify the director seems to have done nothing but point the camera in the right direction as there is no flair or artistry evident how does this have a high review i just cant understand itthe life of a young man mason from age 5 to age 18 where the actors ellar coltrane patricia arquette ethan hawke played the film in real time so it took 13 years to make one of the few films i have ever walked out on the others were in disgust but this one i left due to pure boredom one hour into the film and there had been only 5 minutes of drama then the film was back to documenting the boring fictional life of a boring fictional family now the whole idea of actors who age naturally with the film could have been interesting but the director completely pooched this fantastic opportunity by slavishly doing the film chronologically and slooooooowly instead of mixing it up a bit and showing us the boys life at 6 then at 18 then back to 15 but instead year trailed after year and after an hour i really felt like i had lived through those first few years in real time too so here is my list of things that are more fun that watching boyhood  cleaning your gutters did that earlier today and found a frog that was more exciting  waiting in the waiting room of the dentist at least there is some suspense  getting your teeth drilled by the dentist at least you feel something  a good bowel movement the smell only lasts a few minutes not three hours i could obviously continue but you get the drift this film is the ultimate triumph of style over substance nice idea technically totally forgettable as a filmthe irony about transcendence is that its all about artificial intelligence but it lacks even the most natural of intelligence completely though it starts with a big promise of strong things to come it falls weak and on its knees so fast that once its done you realize that depp has taken you on a joy ride i cannot exactly say if its an entire waste of 120 minutes of your life but it sure does not add any more value to it transcendence looks like the big budget disaster of 2014 so far which the crown held by after earth last year for some its would be ok to argue that the movie was too complicated and its only for the thinkers but in my point of view thinking too much about this would only makes you feel sorry for doing it when will caster johnny depp who is a renowned scientist in artificial intelligence dies his wife uploads his consciousness to a program expecting that his great knowledge can be harvested for future as expected wills consciousness perform brilliantly but evolves in to a greater power and a threat than being an asset and when he breaks the barriers of nano technology he starts to play god the plot clearly has lot of potential but its not something groundbreaking or never heard of before therefore transcendence is already decades late but tries hard to be futuristic but still it could have being save it if didnt have some obvious mistakes there are so many plot holes that make it completely unjustifiable and qualify to be an effective science fiction or a drama if wish to continue to the end you have to completely withdraw yourself from them and go along but its something not very easy to do i dont want to give out any spoilers but keeping the ai part and the nano part aside as they are fictional the stuff that actually happens right now are depicted in a complete bogus manner here how the story flows and the events taken place is far from its narrative and you cant really forgive it seems like the cast is a way to salvage it but to be honest nor depp or morgan has a strong part to perform so their appearance is a waste the fans of both will only end up disappointed and there are some poor looking action scenes that pop up time to time and even that make little sense the cg is not brilliant and cinematography is mundane but the hope of the big cast and the plot i somehow went through the whole moviethe idea of the film is great they are exploring a side of cinema never before explored however i feel that taking on this task should have demanded more creativity and flare from the numb nuts who put this collage of rubbish together forgive me if ive missed anything but i feel that i spent the best part of 3 hours watching a rude illmannered brat grow up with a disappointingly boring life i spent the entire film looking for the beauty or the message in this masterpiece and left with a distinct feeling that the people who produced this hideous montage got carried away with how good they thought the idea was and refused to admit that they messed up nothing bloody happened my definition of a good film is one which makes you feel something which gives you a sense of excitement or admiration something which makes you think about an interesting topic i was present for my growing up and it was infinitely more interesting and personal than this fake hollywood crap also it would have been nice for it to have had an ending or some sort of redeeming quality like an announcement that we had actually been sitting through a practical joke and this film wasnt genuinely being considered great imdb rating 90? maybe thats a joke too and this is all one big joke and everyone in hollywood is laughing at us unfortunately the minimum rating is 110 whereas i believe negative possibilities would have been appropriate in ancient rome they had no concept of negative numbers i feel that seeing this film would have progressed their discovery of this side of 0 dont see this film please and for goodness sake dont let it win any oscars i dont want the industry to be polluted with films like thisthe good reviews of interstellar on imdb are proof to me that movie studios pay people to post positive reviews of movies the current imdb rating is 91no way in hell is that an accurate rating this movie is awfulperiod how could any professional actor read the script for this movie and not be able to tell that it will be a terrible movie? i really would like to say something positive about the film since it has many of my favorite actors in it the actor list reads like a whos who of movie stars but i cannot think of one single positive thing to say about it trust me dont waste 3hours of your life on this film you will regret it just like i dothe good reviews made me watch the movie full out and this was one of the worst hours spent in my life i really have no clue how people can enjoy this movie only if it resonates with an interest for the mundane mediocre average life the movie has not one interesting plot twist the main character is an uninspiring slow paced cynical person his sister is also not a very interesting person to watch the dialogs are just average everyday conversations if this movie gets an oscar i seriously have my doubts about the voting system life can be an uplifting experience the whole movie seems to portray that life is a long string of events to which you have very little influence and the only thing you have left to do is wait and sit out life to me it is incomprehensible to take 12 years and come up with this very disappointing view on life and play it out so boringly there is one scene that actually touched me a plumber reflects back on a lifes lesson he got from one of the main characters and how this positively shaped his life simply said it is a waste to watch this moviethe good cinematography and acting this is a beautiful film and the starstudded cast did as well as could be expected under the circumstances the bad the script this film should be an edgeoftheseat thriller and an exploration of what is possible in the future instead it was as flat as a busted balloon there was no tension there was stuff exploding but we didnt care aside from the lack of suspense a contributing factor to the flaccid plot was the premise scifi films require a simple explanation for the breakthrough being depicted in back to the future we are taken all over the spacetime continuum we get the rules and we go along for the ride the concept of cyberhuman evolution is ahead of the story we do not get the parameters of the concept are these new beings cyberpeople? what are those flying dots? are they pieces of people or matter? there isnt a cohesive story about the scientific breakthrough we do not know when the characters are in jeopardy or what will happen when the thing gets them we dont know what the thing is even death does not have absolute boundaries in this film but there is no explanation for how johnny depp finds a way back at some point we give up trying to put together an explanation for the author and we dont believe it there ends the magic of film we cannot suspend disbelief any longerthe first two acts carried the movie brilliantly ive never laughed harder at more one word dialog lines the action was incredible and the actingsublime some of britains best leading men are on display and their charm and wit are matched only by the twinkling glee that all this is delivered with tonguefirmlyincheek and then they threw it all away in the third act what a disaster witty banter replaced with cannedcatchphrases charm replaced with scatological nonsense incredible stunts replaced with the same tired line work that grew old during the third matrix movie many movies disappoint because they never rise this movie disappoints by how close it came to being truly incredible want to know when to leave? leave when colin firth is out of the picture up to that point its a fun ride but frankly the whole picture hits an iceberg and sinks deep into the abyss after that smug cocky and secondrate the picture becomes a model of the protagonist before making his journey one is left hoping that the entire affair does not spawn a sequelthe first thing you notice is that females are universally portrayed as the source of good and happy and light and the more effeminate the character the better masculine qualities are invariably associated with greed anger pettiness and violence and the more masculine the character the more corrupt reminded me of elfquest there is a tendency in modern entertainment such as broadways wicked to portray evil by men as internally motivated and evil by women as externally provoked its not her fault she did x it was the only option available to her because of what he did its not that she was powerhungry and caused pain to retain her power shes just misunderstood and once we embrace the feminine superiority the world will be a better place retelling the story would be pointless so i wont include any spoilers what matters is the overarching theme this message is wrapped up in a cacophony of sparkle & wideangle camera work but its still a feminist fantasy in which girls are smarter & stronger than boys the feminine is divine and the masculine must be destroyedthe first five minutes of guardians of the galaxy is a hook and gets your teeth sunk in for what looks like a fun creative and quirky ride then after 1015 minutes went by i couldnt help but feel ive seen this exact movie before i had it was a film entitled raiders of the lost ark you may of heard of it if you were to watch the first 10 minutes of each of these films and overlay them you would pretty much be watching the same film so they updated it with a lot of cgi and super heroes because super heroes are the current trend right now of course pepper in a cameo with stan lee right? the movie gets worst from there on out the cgi is over the top the characters are thrown at us with no development at all but with the assumption we are to care about them one minute they are trying to kill each other or not kill each other for some reason why put him in a bag? i dont get it just take the orb then about 60 minutes in the producers decide to blast us with a 2030 minute cgi jack fest that looks just like another film this time they decided to duplicate star wars episode ii not a good film to replicate a space chase with cgi only lucas could love ten million things happening on the screen in the span of one chase scene all while blasting our eyes and our ears with brutally piercing effects your ears will be ringing for 48hrs after seeing this film you might have an epileptic seizure if you try to follow all the action as well this leaves us a little later on with peter quill mysteriously smitten over a girl that he has no connection with that has been established matter of fact he decides to risk his own life to save her and depend on the undesirable to save him sure cue more cgi and miraculous healing a minute later to his face after all he isnt mortal is he? or is he? there is also a tree in the film that walks and conveniently regenerates limbs when handcuffs are needed to be placed on him they have a prison suit that fits a 2 tall raccoon who doesnt know what a raccoon is even though he speaks english but not a prison suit that fits a 8 tree i think this was a case of the cgi department having no problem rendering walking branches instead of a walking rodent the tree has a case of the hodors but not unlike chewbacca he can be completely understood as he speaks articulated sentences except with chewbacca we could infer solo was guesstimating what chewy was saying and having fun with it this is not the case the raccoon actually understands everything the film got so bad that we saw a few people get up and leave about 90 minutes into it we took their cue ten minutes later the person i was with kept looking at me like really?? and left as well the film was an obnoxious capitalistic cgi jack fest that had no story that wasnt stolen from three other high grossing films no character development and no creativity to give you an example of how uncreative it is after ripping off the entire intro to raiders of the lost ark the director i assume tried to pull a song from the reservoir dogs soundtrack and use it to lighten the film in this case hooked on a feeling was used when? when the characters were entering prison of course why of course they were hooked on the feeling of going to prison contrast this with the brilliant work of tarantinos use of the same song in reservoir dogs its like the director never saw reservoir dogs or he had no say in the music used in the film what happened to the clever 70s music to be sprinkled in for comic relief? it just disappeared midway thru the film and didnt return til later they had to have the episode ii cgi jack fest scene to take up half the movie and the pretend romance scene i could go on from there about how bad this movie was but i would have to go back and watch the last thirty minutes maybe after my ears stop ringing and they release the fifth special edition dvd at which point 99 cents will be the going rate for all other versions i might just do that until then ill cross my fingers and hope jj can save the holy trilogy that this film and so many others try to rip off while turning a blind eye its no coincidence that the poster looks exactly like the poster for episode ivthe first few minutes were good and promising however soon unreasonable stupidity took over and the whole thing was swallowed up into just another blockbuster clich_ even if in an unusual packaging lets compare it to transcendence despite its few flaws transcendence depicted a very realistic scenario from beginning to end it was reasonable with its depiction of humans too and remained so throughout not so this one it was made for the masses and the whole premise is stupid the scary thing is that this salivating blockbuster is cheered with a 9 rating while transcendence is written off as something unrealthe first few minutes were good and promising however soon unreasonable stupidity took over and the whole thing was swallowed up into just another blockbuster clich even if in an unusual

killed a lot of people wins against a peaceful superb being that tries to heal the world and they dont just destroy it they try to deceive it using the wife who in 1 second decided to betray her husband the deception fails and the final terrorist girl just waves her gun into the air points to another friend who has betrayed will and just commands kill your fng self and your wife too just so i wont shoot your friend why will doesnt save his wife while simulating death? even better why cant will neutralize one small stupid terrorist girl? how is it he able to get over every other military unit but not this one? cant he use one of his minions to jump fast and furious? cant he attack her from behind? cant he after all just heal his friend? so one stupid terrorist girl makes the world healing machine commit suicide and basically murder his own wife for whom he was doing this all and who betrayed him in no time and without any doubts terrorists win planet loses basically this film is about that if you believe in something so hard that you will kill many people for it and just demand your enemies to kill themselves youll get what you want its about go terrorists go if you think that you are doing good thing its all good the worst possible ending everthe film seemed amazing up until the last 20 minutes of it where logic just blew away and the worst possible ending appeared

survivors of the early dustbowls made no sense corn is the only viable crop? okay i didnt get the whole antiscience apollo faked landings schtick it was irrelevant to the plot in fact the plot points out that science is mans only hope here why indeed have our future selves placed a wormhole next to saturn and not the moon where its more convenient? why cant our future selves if they are so advanced simply contact us directly or show up? why cant they appear in the past when it wasnt too late to save the planet? what was the deal with the barely habitable planets of ice and water and rocks? earth is a jewel yet these places wouldnt support any human populations and indeed they even pale to the dustbowl earth depicted in the movie how is it that weve got advanced enough technologies for ai robots and blackhole venturing spacecraft but we cant save the earth? enters a black hole enters a tesseract of space time and the best he can do is ping a watchs second hand? back to my comment about our future selves right theres only one thing thats rewarding in this movie and its the rather recycled but still fun to watch aspects of the various launches and spacecraft operation yay unfortunately this is a grand total of about 5 minutes of footage the sound in this movie is impressive but at several points it overwhelms the lame dialoguethe creators of this movie had an agenda a were afraid of technology so lets kill it no matter the cost agenda so lets make a movie about it oh and lets spend a lot of money and hire a lot of known faces to spread this agenda and the loopholes in the script wow those loopholes did jdepp and mfreeman even read the script before starting production?? seeing this movie only causes people to resent building an ai to resent progress to resent what the human species has been doing for the past 200k yeasts or so evolving there is nothing wrong in the actions of the ai in this movie only those of the humans trying to stop it eventually causing the humanitys own demisethe buildup to a change from a licentious rich kid to a heroic vigilante was very poorly written the character is not believable in the least a guy spends 5 years on a deserted island struggling for survival yet finds enough time and resources to learn martial arts a foreign language and acrobatics? come on not to mention that he somehow managed to manufacture electronically enhanced arrows and become a hacker you call that believable? really? besides he wants to be a good guy and save the city so he starts by physically attacking his bodyguard and killing people whos only visible crime is working for a mobster some good values there no doubt the other characters are not much better each of them is a stereotype of some kind not a rounded complicated human being in almost every single respect the first episode was one of the worst tv shows ive ever seen i will not watch the second episode honestly i wish i could unwatch the first onethe beginning of the movie was okay and the back story was understandable however trying to make the villain of a classic disney movie into a good guy is infuriating i understand how the directors wanted to make a change but why? there is no point in making a huge change in a classic disney movie for example prince phillip was not at the ceremony as a boy defeating the whole purpose of the main highlight song i know you once upon a dream which did not happen in the movie they met of him asking for directions another thing the fairies flaura fauna and maryweather in the original movie were at least somewhat responsible but in this movie they were the most stupid dimsighted caretakers ive ever seen in the movie they didnt even cast the names not to mention the hilarious cakedress scene they made for auroras 16th birthday aurora never dances with philip which again defeats the whole purpose of the true loves kiss speaking of which the whole true loves kiss scene never happens which makes me want to rip hair out of my head its the whole point of sleeping beauty the whole castle never falls asleep and maleficent awakes aurora with a true loves kiss what? maleficent never turns into a dragon which was the best part of the original movie where the prince slays the evil fairy and saves the princess thats what we want to see basically the only good thing about the movie were the special effects and cgi other than that the whole movie was disappointingthat summary does not mean i find work aimed towards teenagers awful as a rule i dont generalise it simply means its another addition to the genre of teenage fiction which is so poor it deserves to be labelled as tripe in and of itself the divergent series is based on books of the same name which means right from the off many of us who havent read said books knew there would be a devoted fanbase to the series i dont begrudge those fans their opinions and i cant speak for how this movie works as an adaptation what i can do is summarise its effectiveness appeal and overall enjoyability as a standalone piece of cinematography and on the whole i am thoroughly amused in a pitying way the characters have zero appeal because weve seen them all before the deer in the headlights type of teenage lead the heartless and shallow arch enemy and an ensemble of clichs including but not limited to the male warrior and sex appeal the small group of enlightened protagonists the gormless population living under heel etcetera etcetera i had an issue with the distinct lack of originality in the first movie with it bearing notable similarities to huxleys brave new world and orwells 1984 not to mention the more recent hunger games and other pieces of dystopian fiction the point is the movie stands on the work of other successful franchises  whether novels or movies  and allows those series to lay the groundwork for what it portrays as a riproaring fight against tyranny but which is in reality another slugfest of brainless acting numbing action and unoriginal plot points im not going to say anything overly negative against shailene woodley as ive yet to see her in anything but this series but im unimpressed with her acting potential thus far she isnt helped by the poor script and mediocre directing so i wont be too critical but by this stage im not holding my hopes up for an upandcomer in anything beyond typecast roles in future productions the acting of the support cast is what you might expect  an attempt to appeal to the youthful masses and bearing no distinctly original traits of their own in any sense whatsoever the worst part has to be the story the simple motive is if youve seen it in dystopian features youll probably see it in the divergent series the basic structure is flimsy with regards to the castes huxley fans will see what i did there that people are forced to choose and the idea of a rebellion against the oligarchy portrayed is so clichd that it just doesnt hold any interest in fact you might be able to accurately predict the majority of events which transpire in this film and as any moviegoer will tell you that is never a good thing we need originality and we arent given it by any stretch of the imagination action flicks for teenagers need a new format if theyre going to survive i feel and this does nothing to refresh the genre on the contrary its rather like dragging a dead horse into the town square and then repeatedly whipping it for laughs although the only laughs are mine and theyre painful if youre a fan of the novels or someone seeking pointless cinematic thrills you might enjoy this but if you have a refined taste in films or are expecting to see something worth the popcorn i advise you to flee not walk away but literally flee with cheetahlike pace and dont look backthat summary does not mean i find work aimed towards teenagers awful as a rule i dont generalise it simply means its another addition to the genre of teenage

backtell mewhat do you get when you take a bunch of computer nerds who have no concept of effective storytelling and put them into a room to make a movie? you get transcendence the whole thing is based on special effects its a film by people who think half of the cameras running at 300 fps is artor something i am so tired of movies where all that matters is how cool it looks the plot was ridiculousat the end of the movie a group of twentysomething guys were exiting ahead of us and one of the guys said that was pretty excellent i thought well i guess its working for its demographic so to everyone involvedgive up your gun toting worldisan illusion horrible filmmaking and go put your money to good uselike film schooltake the nonsense of inception multiply by about 1000 add some soap opera moments and you get interstellar i dont have to check the spoiler box because there is nothing to spoil or rather there is everythingto spoil but there isnt time enough to call out the instances of bad dialog poor acting lousy hair jobs words strung together that sound interesting but mean nothing contradictions galore real black holes aka plot holes one liners designed to emotionally hook the audience cause there aint no substance visuals to distract cause there aint no substance deus ex machinas as needed and they are too frequently needed etc and so on oh did i mention bad evil mixing? and for those of you whiners about hate no this isnt about hate its about the lack of sound movie making the only sound movie making principle followed isyou get a hap hap happy hollywood ending in sum a shakespearean epitaph is appropriate full of sound and fury signifying nothing ps i did enjoy the music but my bad couldve gotten that for a lot less investment of time and moneysweet suffering christ  this was an absolute howler  god only knows why mm got involved as i thought he was on the up  ok its supposed to be scifi and im all for a wee trip through a wormhole with a return leg through a black hole only to be picked up by the local taxi that was orbiting saturn  this garbage should have been left in a toilet hole  north korea has more street cred than this  ive had more fun scraping dogturd from the deep grooves of my walking boots  i cant believe that a movie that got you to sign up for almost 3 hours could be so consistently pathetic with no redeeming story lines  this stunk more than an overflowing greek beach toilet at the height of summerspoilers i sacrificed myself by entering a black hole in my spacesuit endured a lsd trip of love to send you this singular message not for me but for the good of mankind this is a movie which literally gets worse by the minute should your cinema be graceful and insert a break use it get out the rest of this thing will seem to last 7 years youll probably realized the heartwarming end to it already anyway apparently mankind was able to master robotics and an ai worthy of star trek but still uses current spaceships except when they dont somewhat later cause you know it just wouldnt have worked with all that landing and launching on other planets also it wouldnt have been impossible to send probes to the planets because  well that wasnt in the script either it was however possible to think that a planet orbiting a gigantic black hole so close to its event horizon that one hour stretches to seven years might be a hospitable place to found a new civilization apart from all that nonsense reality like being sucked into it or getting grilled by gamma rays so i have wasted several hours and even some minutes more to write this but if it saves one soul from enduring this spoilers are added in my short review  well  its hard to describe what i watched about an hour ago  ive read the books  of course they are not something special or brilliant but they can perfectly take place in the list of enjoyable ones  i was shocked how much the director has changed the plot of the books and the way that the main characters should be presented in this movie  one word dissapointment   somehow i lost the connection with the whole atmosphere in the middle of the movie  it felt like it is a different story that was missing something  dont know why but the performance of shailene didnt work for me this time  her pretty face just ruined everything that i imagined as a strong and tough character in insurgent   a lot of the key moments in the book were gone and for the readers especially it was not that much of a satisfaction   the second part of the movie was a total disaster  i cant believe how the writer agreed for such a dramatic change in the plot  while sitting and watching the movie i was so inpatient to see the final battle  the emotional conclusion  the way jeanine should have died but the thrill suddenly disappeared after a few scenes   what was that with the box ? some kind of joke or what ? i cant imagine what is gonna be the next movie allegiant and im not sure if im gonna watch it but probably it will be something far away from the real story  the only pros of insurgent were the great cinematography and visual effects supported with not that bad soundtrack   spoiler? just describing the first scene i sit down with my ten year old expecting to be entertained heard so much about this movie its this generations star wars right? first scene a tragic heartjerker that kills off the kids mother what the  who asked for this? i hold my kids hand and we plunge on then a bunch of running around and dumb violence about the time somebody for some reason who claims his father had been killed and his grandfather takes a big hammer and smashes someones head so blood can trickle down into this reservoir my kid and i looked at each other and said are you enjoying this at all? of course not so we left maybe it gets fun and charming after half an hour but honestly this is todays entertainment???spoiler alert i cant believe that there are so many glowing reviews of this movie on the plus side brilliant cg fx cinematography on the negative side the awful acting the terrible plot the script the hokey comic book physics explained for the lowest common denominator in the audience i really liked mcconaughey in dallas buyers club  by far the best thing hes done to date but in this movie? just another flybythe seatofthepants astronaut risking everything and everyone but it all works out in the end of course way too much time at the start of the movie setting up the ending which came as no surprise whatsoever thanks to the ghost and then we discover that love conquers all including science of course probably most of the reason i rated this so low is because with a name like interstellar i was expecting way too much depth on the intricacies of theoretical interstellar travel the time relativity concept et al sigh and the smartass wisecracking robot was the last straw just so badspoiler alert and warning they were lobbing fbombs at you on par with the quantity in the die hard movies they used the bait and switch method of advertising in their trailer the trailer would have you believe colin firth saved a kid from the streets as in obi wan and luke skywalker agent kay and agent jay enders game etc you see that trailer and that is what you are expecting then you get in there and a lot more cursing is going on than you expected then the last scene in the movie is graphic anal sex is this the best you can do after 100 years of cinematography? crude for the sake of it the man sitting next to me got up and left shortly before the end of the movie i thought surely it cant be that much longer he couldnt wait to go to the rest room he never came back i guess hed been warned about the last scene being so vulgar i wish id read the reviews before i went so i would have left when he did or not gone at all im so tired of cgi newsflash movie makers real people cant fly sideways for 20 feet i will be finding out who made this movie and i will be making sure not to try anything else of theirs until it is so old it has been reviewed to within an inch of its life so ill know of any vulgarities so i can decide for myself and not have it sprung on me with no warningsometimes i do not get the ratings at all on the site this film was without a doubt the most overrated film i have ever seen and that is saying a lot since i have been an avid film watcher for 60 years i am used to comic based films as being somewhat thin on the depth of plot lack of character development i suppose one is expected to be a comic reader to fill in the gapsi am not and filled with a plenitude of special effects to wow the audience taking their attention away from the actual film not being that good that said at least a newbie to the story line of the comic book being portrayed can get some minimal entertainment from the film genre this film did not even provide that i was embarrassed for the actors who apparently knew only two degrees of acting recite the lines with no emotional involvement or overact every single line from the simplest to the more emotionally complex of which there were few it was painful for me to see the art so debased the dialog itself was sophomoric and clichd requiring only a third grade education to comprehend the film editing subtracted more than it added to the film while there was much action in the film the editing jumped too quickly between different shots of the action to get anything more than a vague sense that something was happening with no real sense of the specifics of the action all in all at $170000000 marvel could and should have done something to engage more than a superficial response in their audience  which began and ended with opening their wallets to pay to see this $170000000 travesty i gave it 2 stars only because of the films budget and took away 8 because it proves that spending that kind of money still cannot create a film with any redeeming social or intellectual value whatsoeversometimes i do not get the ratings at all on the site this film was without a doubt the most overrated film i have ever seen and that is saying a lot since i have been an

intellectual value whatsoeversomeone who claims to have enjoyed this mess might like to attempt a brief summary of the plot not omitting as the film did why these boring people were doing what they were possibly the only really effective scene is simply lifted from jules dassins `topkapi but the actor holding the rope in this version is nowhere near as interesting as peter ustinov in the original perhaps the silliest effect in motion picture history  the entire traininthechunnel sequence is completely incredible  occurs where the cruse character throws himself back on the tgv using the explosion of the helicopter see fellows the human cannonball at the circus is faked human bodies are destroyed not harmlessly transported by explosions mmle beart however is worth rememberingso the only selling point of this movie is that it was filmed over 12 years wow yeah crazy you know what else happened over a period of 12 years? lots of nothing to lots of other people just like in this movie in which nothing freaking happens 12 years and this is what they came up with? for crying out loud this movie is less interesting than watching paint dry in the middle of an arkansas corn field for 12 years maybe my lifes so much more interesting than everyone elses who gave this movie rave reviews are people so boring that its now cool to pay to watch nothing happen on a screen? and the guy is gay didnt anyone else notice that? ive nothing against gay people but were supposed to believe hes straight come on if thatd been acknowledged at least there might have been something interesting there look hes finally coming out of the closet shocker and what did these people have against hair brushes? maybe its too much excitement to brush your hair and it might have given the movie an air of something actually happening a hint of not so awfullyboringwhygoddidiagreetowatchthis? i want a refundso the big movie of the yearthe big thinker even came up on 9gag asking is this possible i got excited oh boywas i wrong the movie is just terrible they are just throwing that space terminology around like potatoes and people think yea this is smart movie very insightful and out of the box thinking and smart and stephen hawking theorylike way of describing something the people that sayit is great and i got the movie are just arrogant 323i4h5 trying to look intelligent a lot of corners left for questioning and i hate the movie where i watch and ask out loud why the duck did you do that or why the duck didnt you say that when it is obvious it needs more explaining it all is based on us accepting some facts that they say in the movie only because they use few scientific concepts like neutron stars spinning black holes and time dilation but the rest is just pure guessing and in a bad way looks like nolan wanted to try and give it a shot and in 100 years if he got it right people will sayyea there was some guy nolan the producer and he was talking about this in the 2015but i doubt it i gave review for only two movies on imdb this one and batman dark knight risesboth same crap or maybe i am just oblivious and dumb for all of the people giving 88 on imdbso disney ambushes gregory maguire the author of wicked in this tepid retelling of sleeping beauty and the unnecessary explanation for the actions of the exquisite villain we love to hate maleficent maguire had a brilliant idea once upon a time his speculation about a wicked womans progression towards very bad behavior and the reasons behind that transformation changed fairy tales forever maguire caught lightening in a bottle using complex characters and situations to explain a life that ended with a bucket of water wicked had everything that maleficent does not compelling characters and a sturdy plot which gave the characters room to move and grow maleficent is the dollar general version of wicked for its tedious running time of 90some minutes it plods along throwing 200 million dollars of cgi imagery at you which is evidently supposed to divert you from noticing the plot holes and jawdroppingly abysmal dialog it feels padded out in many places its stingy in the extreme and comes across like a puppy thats peed on the carpet you cant hate a puppy all cuteness and earnest contrition for the wet spot maleficent wants your love so badly its willing to humiliate the best villain disney ever had we love maleficent simply because shes bad to the bone why should we care what happened to her back in the day? great villains are often just what they appear to be corrupt individuals who take pleasure in the suffering of others the original maleficent owned her darkness and in the end died for it this new terrible explanation for old mals bitchery was given to us by the horrid linda woolvertons screenplay woolverton also scribbled the wretched screenplay for tim burtons alice in wonderland this reimagining of why the old girl was such a meanie nearly turns disneys grande dame of evil into june cleaver all that was missing was a string of everyday pearls and a frilly apron lets not talk about the three fairies or the weak retelling of the famous pinkblue fight between them i wanted to spray them with raid and watch them die now thats evil evidently the backbone disney showed in 1959 allowing maleficent to invoke all the powers of hell in her dragon transformation is all gone being a real meanie is bad these days no one is accountable for doing bad things theyre just misunderstood being a meanie doesnt sell merchandise being a meanie and dying when you finally get caught doesnt allow for a sequel get ready for maleficent 2 forest frolics two stars one for each of angelina jolies cheekbone prosthetics a truly depressing film from a once innovative studioso  i was yesterday to see this big movie which has a rating of 87 close to the lord of the rings movies the same as matrix or inception and even better than seven or usual suspects it should be good right? doesnt matter that marvel made only crap movies most of them anyway with a few exceptions some of the first spiderman movies and some xmen movies maybe they nailed it this time so the movie starts and after the first scenes we see our hero on an abandoned planet dancing as he goes to collect the item he came for he is not thinking that while he is listening music at his headset someone may be nearby anyway he got what he came for and the scene is very similar to the one in indiana jones no surprise this entire movie is a rip off of other movies you have you hero which is a smuggler and becomes one of the good guys star wars you have a pair a raccoon and a tree only the raccoon understands the tree star wars again our hero out of the nowhere falls in love with the femaleagain star wars only in star wars the process was more real and more fun also like other marvel movies the characters do illogical actions in the most important moments gomora after she fights to the death with her sister trying to cut the power tries to save her when her sister was holding on the edge of the ship while peter quill and the others were waiting for gomora to cut the damn power another stupid moment was when ronan at last he lands but he doesnt destroy the planet the thing he wanted the most to do no he looks at our hero dancing speechless and how did drax survived when he and ronan are hit by a ship at full speed piloted by raccoon? so guardians of the galaxy is a movie full of meaningless special effects explosions after explosions characters that are poorly written actors that dont act very well a poor script and ideas borrowed from other movies conclusion another boring movie by marvel highly over rated i dont know how i think marvel fans are overzealous or the people are just getting dumber day by day you wanna see a good scifi movie watch any of the star wars moviesshould not be called a disney film  the original was fine angelina jolie was better in changeling a much more believable and oscarworthy role several of the actors did a bad job the guy playing the king was especially horrible elle fanning was annoying with her widerimmed smile they turned the three fairies everyone loved into completely hideous idiots bordering on child abuse almost all the characters were onedimensional and uninteresting and how was it that aurora didnt cry when her father died? why didnt anyone see the one of the magical trees at the beginning of the film totally resemble the balrog from fellowship of the ring??? ugh i wish this film could be erased from existence 210  a 2 for the nice effects but the story is overall badly flawed and tries with unsuccessful efforts to shatter categoriesseriously? some people are rating this 10? im no physicist but i do have a basic understanding of what is within the realms of possibility firstly the first line of the synopsis of this film on imdb scarcity of food on planet earth due to drought and famine? what? sorrybut no on our planet we are currently storing seeds in a massive archive from countries all over the world even north korea theyre being stored underground and kept at a very low temperature also we can grow vegetation without sunlight there are many people doing this today so why if for any reason would we be risking our crops to this unexplained environment? this is just the first problem i have with this film at no point was it explained of what the cause of this global famine was i want to know and i waited for 3 hours for an explanation that never came secondly forgoing the wormhole if gravity is that strong to slow down time youd be crushed and waves wouldnt even exist let alone 100 foot waves thirdly the robot why oh why is it a box that seemingly can move over any terrain? throughout the film the same joke humour level at 75%? sarcasm rating at 80%? oh yes these jokes came thick and fast the only joke i could see is that this film was actually made and i wasted 3 hours of my life if you want to watch a brilliant sci fi with matthew maconaghy watch contact it was made in 1997 and was written by the famous cosmologist carl sagan now thats worthy of a 10 the only good point about interstellar was the visuals married to the brilliant soundtrack if you want that then go to a light show or concert sad to say im greatly disappointed nolan should stick with bat manseldom has there been a film where the critics opinions and its true quality diverge so seriously boyhood is empty because it lacks content and form it celebrates the ordinary and mediocrity instead of aiming at something extraordinary as a result it embraces nothingness and is in that sense deeply nihilistic and even depressing anybody with the same camera and some actors could have made this movie or more likely a better one those who praise the film always point out the same circumstance the only thing they can say which is this film is like real life i have to say this is true on the most superficial level imaginable but i may ask is that a good thing? is this if film history has taught us anything what a film should be? real life according to linklater means a lifespan during which nothing happens the boyhoodexperience is the equivalent of your experience waiting in line at the supermarket yes this is the real life linklater presents us nothing happens in this movie nothing no story no interesting characters just ordinary situations from real life of course there are films in which nothing or very little happens and they can be great tarkovskys mirror antonionis lavventura or tarrs the turin horse come to my mind but you need ideas you got that linklater? you need a style or form which cannot be separated from the content you need a capable director that can create a form of visual communication boyhood offers none of those things the film gets praised especially by those who have never seen an arthouse movie and mistake it for an art film people are misled so easily boyhood is pure blankness shallowness superficiality nothingness to praise boyhood as a masterpiece is actually a slap in the face of all those directors who put a real effort into creating works of art that have real value boyhood is in fact an antifilm in the sense that it stands against everything film should be  be it an artistic masterpiece or just an entertaining fun movie the film is neither a work of art nor entertaining in that regard it can be called a nonfilm it celebrates its own nonexistence and drowns in its nihilism i doubt this was linklaters intention but it certainly is the result of what he created be warned this is not a drama the movie is the opposite of a carefully constructed work of art its nothing but a reenactment of memories a collection of unmeaning scenes we may or may not know from our own lives bowling playing video games reading harry potter etc i think it is only fair to ask what is the point? i went to see this film having high hopes and having read all the raving reviews expecting a masterpiece from richard linklater the director of the great waking life i liked the trailer which makes the movie look much more interesting than it actually is actually everything that happens in the movie is already in the trailer the basic idea of filming a boy growing into a young man during twelve years is interesting yes but sadly the film offers nothing more than that this is not enough sadly many critics seem to have liked the basic idea so much that to them it didnt even matter if the director would be able to make it interesting or not the film which is much too long follows an unstable family and focuses on the life of mason a character that has absolutely no interesting characteristics whatsoever the intelligent viewer will be unable to connect with such a person mason walks through this film as if he was in a coma or half asleep he has no ambitions at some point he gets his first kiss gets interested in photography the ultimate art form for unimaginative lazy people during high school havent we seen that already too many times? goes to college at which point the film ends i kid you not this is the whole movie the mother becomes a teacher at a local college and always seems to attract the wrong guys the father is an unemployed loser who only talks about pop music and ends up being a square masons sister the directors daughter grows up too and thats pretty much all you can say about her it is actually impossible to spoil this film because nothing happens unless you consider the fact that mason finishes high school a spoiler linklater completely fails to dramatize his ideas as a result following this movie feels like watching family home videos of a family you do not care about  just with better picture quality instead of using form or contentdrama to make the film interesting boyhood refuses to do just that and therefore remains superficial you dont get to the essence of real life by only showing the surface of things everybody could do that it is really hard talking about this film because there isnt a single interesting character or scene in it you just follow ordinary events in the lives of these people stay away from this movie yes this review will get negative votes just because i didnt like the film unlike the critics union well none of those critics were able to offer a single insightful argument that would speak for this nonmovie in fact many even admitted the film lacked interesting characters or style but because of the 12yeargimmik they call it a masterpiece give me a break i would be willing to debate any of these pseudointelligent critics and tear them into pieces over and outscript 010 acting 110 dialogues 010 characters 010 environment110 special effects 010 marketing 1010 all those positive reviews are fake this movie is nothing but a good marketing campaign the first two hours were so boring that people started leaving the cinema apart from the giant wave at the end of the film there are no other special effects the robot is so primitive that you want to cry the director of this movie is hopeless just watch the ad on youtube and it will be enough entertainment for the poor and tastelessscience fiction fans dont need everything spelling out for them thats why the narration was removed from blade runner thats why 2001 a space odyssey has no dialogue in its opening and closing twenty minutes thats why r2d2 doesnt speak english and then theres interstellar matthew mcconaughey even takes the time to explain the origin of his daughters name to his daughters face this blunt method of explaining murphys law to the audience is just one example of the unnecessary exposition which interstellars running time is so bloated by it is also the first of many inferior echoes of contact in contact james woods explains occams razor in a similar fashion however it is justified by the court of law context in which the scene takes place more significantly however is the lifting of a major theme from contact in which jodie foster never fully moves on from the loss of her father jessica chastains character here does likewise only without the emotional resonance because she is so bitter that its hard to sympathise with her the other female character in interstellar yeah theres only two also spends all her screen time pining after a man feminists  stay away another silly moment is the shot for shot homage to event horizon yes there really is a direct lift from event horizon this is where one scientist explains to another scientist what a wormhole is which is like a driving instructor explaining to another driving instructor what biting point is it wouldnt happen like ever at least when sam neil gave the low down on wormholes in event horizon he was addressing blue collar workers so it was once again justified by context perhaps the goofiest thing in the whole film is tars a computer with delusions of being the next hal 9000 which is actually nothing more than metallic origami have i mentioned it knows a joke? yeah it has been programmed with one joke and it uses this joke many times the joke is that humour is quantifiable by percentage why watch this when you can watch contact 2001 a space odyssey or silent running? why go for christopher nolans take on dust bowl migration when you can read john steinbecks instead? on a positive note there are some cool graphics to look at you know like the cool graphics in the hobbit or transformersscene a semidarkened meeting room some people with dark robes are sitting around a table chairman ok people i present to you this years insult to human consciousness and spirit  this time in movie form you know we have popular hit music we have mainstream news socalled moviestars but we need a more open and direct insult to worthless masses as you know these masses are nothing more than viruses wait lets also use this line in the movie robed character #1 noted chairman good also dont forget to mention how we use tabloid news for communicating by the way feed the tinfoil cap trolls on international forums let them produce more disrespect and ridicule for truth seekers lately more people seem to be able to read symbols rc #2 can they understand that we ridicule them in plain sight once this movie is released? ch what? are you kidding? they still believe official stories for everything lets release this movie and youll see how many people will say hey this is great fun to watch people kill each other violently in blood fest humanity deserves wars and torture people the have no real respect for each other and for life did i say theyre like viruses? rc #1 yes master well add this line to the moviesave yourself the time with this one unless your less than about 12 years old or have a very low iq its like the ideas been pieced together from other shows its stupid inconsistent hypocritical ridiculous and most of the acting is terrible its a pity because the underlying story with the mother and her associates is the shows only redemption you just have to sit through the agony of the rest of the show to get this maybe they should save us all the heartache and just tell us what happens with that story linesave your money and your time except that the cgi moments were great but were better done in the new cosmos tv series and the film gravity this film at nearly every level of filmmaking was boring this certainly would be true if you have no interest whatsoever in science fiction or fact i had problems enjoying this film on several levels 1 the annoying musical score never seemed to fit the moment bombastic 2 the overthetop soap operatype melodrama all characters it seemed carried an unlimited supply of angst and tears 3 the irritation of trying to hear the actors mumble inane dialogue especially michael caine 4 burning corn fields look like iraq oil fields on fire 5 after 23 years the watch left on the bookshelf still ticking and evidently keeping time 6 chasing speeding drone through cornfield with a flat tire all with a smooth ride 7 hollywood wildwesttype manomano fistfight between damon & mcconaughey in air tight space suits through a worm hole on an ice planet in another galaxy far far away 8 midway and unexplained appearance of the topher grace character 9 sets and props often looked like they were borrowed from ancient tv show twlilight zone 10 absolutely zilch onscreen chemistry among actors 11 poor ellen burstyn looking so artificial in all that heavy latex and make up i quit you get the picture of this picture awfulrented this movie over the weekend after oscar nominations and reading reviews etc i think the appeal of this movie begins and ends with the fact that linklater made a project of filming his daughteractress for 12 years in what appears to be very self indulgent and opportunistic i cant understand how an actual documentary like hoop dreams gets snubbed not too mention selmas director getting snubbed but this nearly 3 hour marathon receives nothing but accolades from the academy the novelty of watching the family physically grow for 12 years is about as interesting as it sounds you watch them physically grow thats it thats the big wow factor of the film id of preferred to watch grass grow actually the acting and scenes seem forced and i couldnt figure out if he was trying to make us believe this was a documentary? a documentary would have been soooo much more interesting and entertaining mason the sons character never really evolves the clich single mom who makes bad choices when it comes to men has been done before keep in mind this is not a documentary this is a moviestory i couldnt help but think to myself while watching this film that i know several families and individuals that have actual interesting and compelling true life stories that make this film look ridiculous i mean mason gets called a slur in a bathroom? oooh masons first alcoholic step dad makes him cut his hair without even asking? a commentary on the banality of life is what this movie amounts to for me? clearly im in the minority as most seemed to have enjoyed the film i dont see the originality excellence in acting directing etc outside of using the same actors for 12 years one of which is the directors daughterrented this movie over the weekend

everything at times the big question is why? as a film in its own right its not terrible but comparing it to the original it literally pales in comparison despite being a liveaction rip why did we need this  sure on some level it may reach those who havent seen the original and dont want to watch an old anime but really  why should we indulge the multiplexers who refuse to watch anything made before 2005? its not bad  its poor a poor relation of the original in the uk we often get 50th anniversary etc rereleases of old films nationwide admittedly not in all cinemas in fact cinderella monogatari was out a few years ago so the idea that a cheap copy is good because itll help open it up to new audiences the cast are all ok  until you watch the original anime overall its soso as a film however when you compare it to the original its really a poor show and because its a carbon copy you cant help but compare it line for line scene for scene actor for actorremakes are regular

philip glass from watchman 10* ?* story 2* way the story is given to us 10* logical error 100* really i love quantum theory but pointing logical errors i dont refer to quantum theory this movie is simply a 3h of melodrama  1h about the food is ending?? imagine the the day after tomorrow with the 1h intro about deadly force of cold  in one part of the movie the two people are traveling on foot faster than starship that is send after them   you can catch the drone by laptop when you driving a old car but you cant stop space ship having 2 supercomputers  apparently in the future gta is no problem because even the hangars do not have security?? no wait you have to use card and thats all the fly control  and the crew is sleeping?? there is plenty of others logical errors that cant let you watch the move so dont waste your money  you were warnedreally flynn? you treat your customers of your art like this? so bad empty no sense no closure just brutal way to treat us you are writing to entertain do that dont punish us with an ending you just cant figure out on your own  hire help im sure stephen king or dan brown could have given you a better ending  no charge the story moved along nice and you had me but the twist  it was good i think the hole in the script was the couple that stole money from amy they would have gone to the press probably sold their story once they realized who they stole money from i mean those kind of characters always do that? i actually thought thats what you would do wrong instead you killed 25 hours of my life plus another 10 minutes writing this dribble next time im reading spoilers for any of your stories to make sure i dont waste any more timereal life well yes for this boring persons and heroes of this movie life is here that is for sure but life that really should not be meant for anybody as you can see that heroes of the movie are bored with their every day life and if that was intention than they really nailed it but then again why watch it what is the purpose in making movie about completely regular life of one functional but boring family at the end of the movie i started to value my time only because i lost three hours spending time with this people while i could have spent it on my people and again if this was purpose of the movie then again great job as i am going with my family now and we will have some joy and happiness so totally opposite then this and who nows maybe we will record things on video from now on and we will maybe make more enjoying life movie with heroes getting older and with no budget at all i wonderreading the other reviews here its hard to conceive that i watched the same movie everyone is gushing about the central premise is hardly noble although perhaps quite the likely selfish outcome ie after trashing this planet lets go trash some others the black hole visualizations were quite lame this is not a great scifi film even remotely in the league of 2001 although a cursory superficial viewing might suggest so to an unthinking nonscifi buff a great scifi film would naturally start by 1st adapting a great scifi story these are yet to be made such as ringworld dyson spheres and fleet of worlds concepts to think that all these mind boggling stories exist yet this rather old and tired story concept is chosen to lavish money on is strange although it is somewhat understandable as the aforementioned stories would be much greater challenges all around and so its best that they are ignored rather than poorly realized as this primarily propaganda piecequite frankly one of the worst movies ive ever sat through forget the length forget the plot forget the acting the story was so far fetched and actually insulted the intelligence of the paying viewers this movie isnt even worthy of a review the acting was terrible across the board with the exception of rosamund pike even neil patrick harris was terrible ben affleck has some talent but ive never seen an actors talent meter swing so radically from one side to the other theres no redeeming value or consistency in anything affleck does those of you that are digging deep and sharing your views of the brilliance of this movie need to have a reality checkprobably the worst movie i ever seen ive just logged in to imdb to write this review i cant believe that this movie is on the top 250 top 250 of worst movies probably is the right list for this not into fantasy movies in general but there are some limits i didnt realize that there was any plot at all just some random scenes all around a galaxy its really sad that i cant vote 0 out of 10 regarding visual effects the picture was really nice and served in 3d but this was the only plus side of the whole experience boring trying hard to be fun but wasnt really and amuse a popcorn audience well hope we will not have a sequel for this nice wasted 2 hours of a sunday evening hope i will not see another  artwork like this in the near future i cant understand why the expendables are not on top of this movie its a crap title as well that should be popularpretty much all movies which i ever liked are highly rated on imdb although not all highly rated movies on imdb are movies which i like and this is one of them the movie was shot over many years and this is its main selling point cool thats it nothing else it was a clich scene after clich scene for almost three hours three hours which ill never get back  id rate it with negative 3 but theres no rating lower than 1 sometimes a movie starts bad it goes on for a while but then at the end something new and unique happens and you think oh i totally did not expect that so it was worth seeing it well not now bad start middle and end oh he met another girl really they like each other? is this how people who like each other act? the acting was so poor and just about every line said was said in so unnatural way real people in real situations simply do not look like or act like that i felt no attachment of any kind to any of the characters none of them seemed to have any social skills none of the characters has done anything worth mentioning in all their lives they had some failed attempts for deep and meaningful conversations the plot for such conversations goes like blah blah life blah blah meaning blah blah now be impressed with how much we said blah blahpretty much all movies which i ever liked are highly rated on imdb although not all highly rated movies on imdb are movies which i like and this is one of them the movie was shot over many

to be his sister the leading female actor was the wrong person for the role she did not portray a rough and tough charactershe was just a pretty girl with the perfect eyelashes after a fight scene if you have not seen the first movie of this series do not go see this movie you will not under7stand what is happening and why you will be lost the movie also did not seem like 3d movie do not waste your money on this movie wait till it comes out on dvd trust me you will thank me for the advice duaneplease save yourself 3 hours of your life and read this before you watch this movie im sorry to those who want to say this was a profound moviei feel sorry for you this by far was one of the most unimaginative movies i have seen ever the continues praise of how real this movie is really? if i wanted to watch reality i watch a documentary there is a reason why we have documentaries and why we have movies this was not entertaining thought provoking or even remotely imaginative yes it took 12 years to make so what? i mean they had 12 years to think of a story? or give some meat to these actors to chew on i dont understand how there are so many awards and nominations this movie is getting its as if people who watch movies and who are suppose to be critics forgotten what a movie is suppose to be or how to be critical im not a critic but i have spent years and years watching movies and i can tell the difference between whats good and whats not whats art and whats sh*t rolled in glitter let me break it down story = none acting = uninspiring shallow character = one dimensional cinematography = point and shoot directing = great imaginative writing = none existent if a movie has no story no real depth in character or breaking boundaries in cinematic techniques then its not a good movie i do appreciate the fact that this is a unique movie in terms of its actual built but in terms of a movie no i didnt feel a second of inspiration when watching it and now feeling angry that its taken 3 hours of my life this years movies have been the worst in years at lease the positive side of things is at least it wont take me long to forget this movieplease dont waste your time or money on this hypedup piece of garbage i dont think ive ever been as disappointed in an ending not that the beginning and middle were all that great as i was with this stupid illogical movie the only spoiler i have is one of the biggest plot fails ever shes escaped her captor by slitting his thread shes virtually covered with blood and the hospital simply allows her to go home where she coyly showers it off totally amazing that this movie has gotten the positive press and reviews it has received  if this doesnt make you realize how incredible hollywood hypemarketing system is at distorting reality nothing will i only wish i could give it a zeroplease do not waste your time or money on this nonsense oh boy where do i start ok for me the worst thing is when she gets back and tells everyone that neil patrick harris kidnapped her rosamund he did this by bludgeoning her and she lost a large amount of blood which he cleaned up then he takes her diary to her husbands fathers house to burn how does he even know of this location?????? but he makes such a p$$ poor attempt to burn it which would take 5 min to do properly as opposed to the 30+ to clean the blood and no one questions this even once no one even looks for any wounds or asks about her wellbeing and she is not treated for any wounds oh and the hospital sends her home covered i mean a copious amount blood no flipping way the hospital would clean her looking for wounds especially with this much bloodi could go on and on but just read the other truthful reviews they will point out most of the other glaring mistakes and downright intelligence insulting nonsense i really wish imdb would have a 0 or negative review number as this does not even rank a 1 i give this 5 for utter bull$h1*parents dont let your kids to see this movie it is a brain wash action to show evil is good and humans are bad maleficent it says is a fairy but she is looking nothing like one she is projected to be a demon and the images with her above clouds with black wings and huge horns trying to really brain wash people she is not a angel or a fairy most of the fairy creatures from the movie are ugly and same as the bad actress angelina are evil the movie is not pg should be pg13 at least someone or many are trying to change perspective of kids and kill the innocence dont be fooled by the special effects see behind the scene before is too late if is not alreadyoverall the movie was ok and i dont regret watching it it was entertaining and beautifully shot even if many scenes were referential to other movies as for the acting elle fanning was ok as aurora though the character felt a bit empty but to be fair there wasnt much in the script to work with i wish she had a little more to her than childish goodness there actually wasnt much for any of the actors to work with i wont lie im no fan of jolies acting she comes across as haughty in every role humility and vulnerability are completely outside her range but her haughtiness works here and she was good as maleficent except in the scenes where she was supposed to be angry i got no hint of her anger fire or passion she was merely shouting i wanted to feel her rage biggest problem with the movie is the number of plot holes there is no real explanation given for why the moors and the kingdom of men are enemies the king decides to attack for virtually no reason the relationship between stefan and maleficent is graced over and yet this relationship goes to the core of maleficents being we also see nothing of stefans life so we are unable to fully understand his actions and motivations stefan becomes mad and paranoid with no real love for his daughter and that just sort of happens i could go on and on about things left with little explanation another major problem i had was the previews of the movie lied to me in a big way the movie wasnt a retelling of sleeping beauty from mealficents point of view it was an entirely new story i wanted to find out why maleficent was evil  the maleficent i know and lovehate or hatelove i wanted to see maleficents evil with new understanding lets face it maleficent was nowhere near evil in this movie shes angry for a moment and thats it which lead me to imagine other ways to tell the story perhaps humans had seriously wronged her aurora was the child born to unite the 2 warring kingdoms of men and that maleficents plan was to stop this union for real substantial reasons  the story could have been easily told with a new perspective while being seamlessly woven into the known fairy tale every story has two sides right? in conclusion i wouldnt recommend this movie if they were going to deviate so much from the known disney or perrault version they could have fleshed out the story a little lot moreoscars coming up next month  which nominee do i wish to see??? after much debate with my wife and friends we decide on boyhood flashback 11 years oscars coming up next month  which nominee do i wish to see??? after much debate with my wife and friends we decide on lost in translation back to present im sitting here recalling the two worst movie decisions of my life craziest thing would be if boyhood actually wins best picture ha as we all watched our backsides getting numb we occasionally exchanged puzzled looks at each other as if to say what the heck is going on here? the movie much like its 11 year old predecessor made all of us ask how could we all be so different from the critics that raved about this movie its only claim to fame appears to be that it took so many years to film it duh we have things nowadays in hollywood called make up and multiple actors that pull off time changes with no problem  just look at benjamin button ive seen better hidden camera performances than this scripted documentary displayed i would believe that the director didnt have to say action hed just say act normally mason and nicole have a great little chuckle at the end of the movie they know what they just pulled off what a waste of time 35mm and moneyone of the worst movies ever painful for ridiculously drugged out people or those lacking any knowledge whatsoever take your pick overacted and pretentious moronic actors using big words with a total lack of understanding of what they mean i never want to see anne hathaway again ever i only want to see mcconaughey was even worse if that is possible i feel sorry for the actors who played small parts in this movie i formerly had respect for most of them some of the pictures were pretty cool too bad the dialog didnt rise to the level of the cinematography but neither did the storyline the characters were not fully developed in the story it was sillyone of the most ridiculous spectacles of bad storytelling i have ever seen in my entire life gone girl gets its title i think from the fact that she was supposed to be done away with murdered and disposed of but is really gone psychologically‹she is a pure psychopath the movie tries to tell you that she is highly intelligent and meticulously plans to fake her own murder and frame her husband for it heres the pathetic execution of her plan 1 he leaves the house one morning and she springs into action 2 she breaks the glass coffee table pours about a half quart of her own blood in one puddle in front of the kitchen sink that much blood from a violent attack would be all over the room 3 she flees leaving the front door open 4 a nosy neighbor notices the door ajar and calls the husband somehow the neighbor knows exactly where he is but no one saw the wife leave 5 the husband comes home he has not a scratch on him 6 he is totally cooperative with the police 7 they eventually find her diary in a wood stove at the husbands fathers house the wood stove door is ajar and the diary is only partially burned it really makes you wonder how that played out‹that the husband put the diary in there to burn but just left it singed all that work cleaning up the blood at home but not to burn the book as if he needed to make a special trip to his dads house to dispose of a stupid book and the only thing incriminating that she wrote was on one page which he couldve simply torn out 8 when the wife runs away she only changes her appearance slightly and then instead of secluding herself she makes friends with some lowlifes with whom she sits and watches her story unfold on tv 9 she murders the neil harris character in an attempt to switch the blame to him that would then imply he was the one that drained so much blood from her back at her home he cleaned it up and he put her diary in the wood stove ? his car wasnt seen at her house he then kept her a prisoner starved and raped heryet she found the opportunity and strength to kill him but didnt call the police from his house to come rescue her rather she jumps in his car and drives all the way home 10 upon returning home she has no wounds consistent with the bloodletting at her original house or at the hands of her alleged kidnapper 11 there is no visit to or investigation of the alleged kidnapping crime scene‹house on the lake 12 the hospital sends her home in a nurses uniform underneath which she is still caked in blood this movie is just about the lamest piece of s**** i have ever seenone of the lamest most unconvincing pieces of video material ive been subjected to my stepson said it was good so i gave it a try its shite ive loved comics since early childhood so its another reason why i thought this would appeal to me its so repugnantly fake im at a loss for words youll be hardpressed to find a moment where you can get immersed and forget that its obnoxious actors on screen that youre watching i just dont know what else to add except to speculate what made it receive 82 rating from the audience women drooling over the protagonist? kids into parkour and commercial tunes? im baffledone big disappointment i kinda liked divergent but insurgent tries way to hard to be the next hunger games the movie doesnt have a good story line and the acting performances of all the young actors was very bad especially shailene woodleys performance was unbelievably bad this movie tries way to hard to be the next hunger games but it fails at each part bad storyline bad acting and an uninteresting story is why i see this film as a big disappointment if you liked the hunger games you better wait until the next hunger games arrives in november sorry divergent fans but insurgent isnt going to be the movie of the yearomg this movie was so stupid like really waist of timei even pulled out my cell phone and browsed fb while it was playing because of how stupid this movie was the music at some parts was just so way over kill too loud and too way dramatic the whole story was crap and did not make any logical sense so ur telling us that nasa did not know that the best pilot to fly the space ship was living only about a car drive away from ur secret hiding base? u did build a space ship to fly out but cant have mri machines anymore? a drone was flying for 10 years and no one saw it or knew about it? wtf its like the person who wrote this movie was like thinking we are all so stupid and wont understand who this movie is not making any seance ok the only part i did like about the movie was when they found the bad guy who try to kill the main character that was something interesting and his trying to dock into the space station it was nice story but still none nonsensical bc with time it just dont make any sense so they 2 walk away from the space ship and then when he called the space ship to rescue him u can see they fly so far no way they could of walk that distance then at the same time they rescue the good guy via plane the bad guy can walk all the way back to another plane? while a 3rd one get blown up???wtf and also how many shipped did they send anyways it just did not make any sense to me this movie its just way too stupid sorry but it wasi want my money backoliver may not be dead  f**k series where the hero dies and to the half of the season  my wife and i will not watch the series if oliver queen not stay alive and return to the series through a maximum of two episodes so  giving time to change the scenario  liven it in any way except for memories of other characters in the series oliver and felicity have to be together and that we have not yet seen in the series atomic  ant  is superman and thats what he needs to become in the series  if he has already put some superpowers  now it turns out that all permanent characters in the series to become a super heroes which makes no sense just because the current craft shops in the series  giving the lowest rating oliver back okay this movie is a comedy right? okay i know that its says here on imdb that it is a drama mystery sci fi but it must be a comedy because the movie is totally laughable the script is totally laughable or worse its a kind of the lawnmower man from 1992 remakewhich was also laughable but you can forgive the lawnmower man for being a bad movie but this one you cant this movie is just like if someone gave a scientist 20 millions dollars so he could invent a technology that could turn cheese back too milk again a total waste of money i sincerely hope that mr depp and mr freeman has donated most off their money that they earned from this to doctors without borders or a children cancer foundation i once saw an interview with mr deep saying that he never goes to any premiere now i know whyokay so i am not one to judge tv shows it is not hard to please me when it comes to watching tv i watch a drastic range from the walking dead to the mentalist to family guy i absolutely adore superheroes and can not say enough about last year movies like the avengers dark night rises and so on so when i wasnt feeling well tonight and decided to stay home i found the perfect opportunity to check out this new show my sister recommended it and i saw the commercials the guy looked hot it looked full of action and seemed like a fun night the last show she recommended to me was revolution and i was not disappointed hmm what she failed to mention is that no one in this show can act the plot is not bad if looked at it overall but each episode is so boring there is no chemistry what so ever i had to force myself to watch eight episodes and i quit i was about to go to sleep when i got angry how the heck is this show doing well? seriously how is that good shows get canceled that actually have great characters plot and directing and this peace of ++++ is actually getting acclaim am i missing something?????okay lets make this simple this is perhaps the worst movie ever made it is more than predictable it so lacks originality that i not only figured out what was going to happen throughout the entire movie less than 10 minutes into it i even could tell you the lines of each character before they spoke them the highly touted fx? they were average at best and considering the budget of this film they could have been infinitely better the acting editing and cinematography were far from cutting edge the best part of this filmthat it ends but not nearly soon enough your best bet skip this movie watch the miniature golf tournament on espn2 insteadokay guys i gave this movie the lowest score possible for good reason so the movie is a revamp of the guardians franchise some horrible american actor plays a human who was abducted and raised by space pirates that teams together with one of the worst female actors to date  her character is essentially a ninja wicked west of the west let not forget to mention the other 3 main characters a tree a raccoon and a meat head who team up to defeat the strongest entity in the universe + a back and forward treasure hunt the acting is crap the story line is so obvious within minutes of starting even the feeble minded could predict the outcome as for the title guardians of the galaxy i would like to comment that while there is a lot of space flight they only save one planet sort of i am so glad i downloaded a cam version of this movie and didnt waste a cent i would like to say a big eff you to whomever picked the cast to this point marvel has had amazing casts iron man thor  captain america? this movie taints marvel in their pursuit of profit they have created another flop do not bother watching this movieokay from where do i start? first when i heard ben affleck was in it something told me movie would suck & it seems my inner voice was right lol at first movie seems weird no intense moments nothing like that i keep watching in hope something interesting comes but in vain its just so dead empty & jumbled that lacks everything oh by the way there are lots of mistakes im not going to mention all but a few for example she is interviewed at the hospital were she arrived covered in blood telling the story that she was raped and nobody cleans the blood of her in the hospital and she is in a room with lots of cops plus husband lawyer etc etc then she leaves with her husband that was accused of murder and they go home together its just an enormous junk heap of illogical and nonsense movie oh and movie is so stretched its 230 minutes of boring uninteresting & unrealistic plot its as bad as finchers fight club which is another overrated piece of junk just avoid this movie do no waste your time on itok so i will start out by saying that i am a huge fan of the books and the series i love it this movie just made me extremely angry i burst out the theater exclaiming they ruined it they ruined it and i ranted on about it for about an hour or so after btw this is my strong personal opinion heres why i hate it so severely 1 it was extremely unfaithful to the book 2 they took out 90% of the books story and replaced it with an awful replacement book by far wins 3 this movie was dark and disturbing a lot of killing and pain and blood and several scenes were otherwise classified as dark my opinion 4 the box does not exist in the book the simulations to open this box do not exist in the book and i hated seeing jeanine torture the divergents 5 tris hates herself and thinks about killing herself i dont think thats a good message shes sending out for a main character to hate herself and think about killing herself may appear that its ok for people out there to feel and do the same and its not 6 the script was poorly written nothing else needed to add 7 the plot was extremely predictable i understand that a ton happens in the book but this way it isnt predictable and i get excited to turn each page in the movie you know what will happen oh this is a simulation even though they pretend it isnt oh they pushed her weak point of course she will do what they want her to do oh she did that yup i knew he would come oh i knew everyone would join yup i knew they would overpower him that sort of junk so there you go i dont want to come off like a hater but i thought it should be known especially with this movie that you should save your money and go buy some ice cream hope i helped a bit and didnt spoil to much =ok ill keep this brief but ill also nail my credentials to the mast first i know science cosmology scifi and filmmaking pretty well i have in the past taught film studies at degree level and worked on the production of more than one major hollywood scifi film i read stephen baxter and i like space stuff a lot more than a lot and why am i telling you this? because i should have loved interstellar but i didnt for one simple reason it is a truly dreadful piece of filmmaking i wont even bother with dissecting the science in the film because that isnt really the issue it is wrong on pretty much every level im not even going to bother complaining about the absurd audio balance in the sound mix and ill ignore the substandard special effects  because fx dont a great movie make the issues i have with interstellar are essentially these the film is an arsenumbing three hours long and feels far longer the pace is stunningly poorly judged  the first hour in particular could have been cut to ten minutes and far more would have been gained than lost the characters are paperthin and i didnt care about any of them the plot is entirely derivative mostly of the vastly superior contact the special effects arent special at all and the editing or lack of is so selfindulgent it is a text book example of a director so enamoured with his project that he loses objectivity the result is a plodding flabby and desperately dull movie devoid of any real excitement or emotional impact i wont go on but special mention must be made of the planets  paddling world and coldworld you see virtually nothing of either and so utterly uninteresting are they that what should have been a moment of genuine cinematic wonderment was squandered with a bit of poor cgi painfully inferior to a perfect storm and a location less dramatic than your own back garden ive probably not been a brief as i intended but as i write this i feel the disappointment and actual anger i felt on leaving the cinema bubbling to the surface again it was a total letdown and a waste of more than three hours of my life the gushing reviews on here are ridiculous and absurd and i am forced to conclude that reviewers either watched a different film to me or saw something so brilliant it completely passed me by i am fairly confident i didnt doze off although i desperately wanted to so in conclusion contact did all of this far far better fifteen years ago in contact the characters are human believable beautifully realised and you care what happens to them the relationship between father and daughter is deeply moving and inspiring but then the plot is far more sophisticated anyway dealing with the social tensions and impact of the discovery of extraterrestrial life the science is accurate and entirely plausible it was written by carl sagan after all the movie is genuinely thrilling and full of spectacle and it has something very profound to say contact is everything interstellar is not and it has a considerably shorter running time contact brought tears to my eyes interstellar bored me to tearsok i was fooled by both some of the reviews and the high score and i wasted about 3 hours of my life sitting in the cinema i cant say im a scifi lover but if films like blade runner only get 82 then this one should get 45 i watched gone girl the other day which is so much better than this one both in pacing and plot and that film only get 84how can this one get 9? another thing is the ending is too predictable and too sweet happy ending is good people love things that make them happy but in reality there never has a perfect ending like thatthe ending seems too sweet for me and some people are spoiled by these good endings also dont understand why made the brother a completely fool? he seems has nothing to do with everything? a contrast? to what? and the film never mentioned him after the girl sorry i even dont remember their names find out the secret which doesnt make sense to me anyway im disappointed and i dont want t say more about this film i fell asleep several times due to that horrible pacingi cant believe a film could be sooooo long which almost becomes a torture for meok i admit im a marvel fan seen almost all the movies and i know some movies are better than others i was quite surprised this movie got a 85 on imdb so it should be good right? my reaction after the last dance was seriously? marvel made this shyt? let me put this simple this movie steals like everything from the original star wars mixes an evil yonda not yoda in it together with pj the raccoon from over the hedge an ent living tree from lord of the rings and a little bit of star trek also the real bad guy gets the hammer of thor only a bigger one but thats a marvel studio idea already it could be a weird but good mixture but it ends up as a deadly cocktail where only the cgi is better than star wars and would actually deserve a better rating than 1 seriously this is a one to watch if you want to see marvels biggest blunder ever marvel isnt marvel if there wont be a sequel but i will skip that one on forehand leaves me to the question how the **** did this movie get a 85?oh my another science fiction film made by those geniuses who never took a science class in life interstellar is a boring slow plodding condescending type of film that thinks is much more smart than it realty is cantt just people go and explore three planets without this melodramatic nonsense? wouldnt it be much better if all this humanist approach was discarded in favor of a story based on the true adventure of traveling through a wormhole? if people want drama there are a huge number of other much better films if i want to feel bad i will watch schindlers list if i want some good science fiction i will watch aliens is it that hard for people to get it? this was supposed to be a science fiction adventure for gods sake why do these genius have to butcher what could have been a great film with all this overbloated sentimentalism this sacchariny mess? this is yet another proof that the masses are brain dead they laud anything that is over complicated with mindless twists with some sort of stupid revelation as the work of a genius interstellar is another extremely over rated film it rivals prometheus in stupidity id rather shoot a nail through my foot than ever watching it againoh lord where art thouÑ? well let me start with this i was thinking of many different titles for my little essay most of which were either political incorrect or simply too plain to use but still just a few what happened? or oh my balls or the peak of feminism or the extinction of mankindÑetc so the point is that the story we all know well from our childhood got so many twists that you can easily forget it and look into the world of a totally other tale the evil fairy godmother back in the days just an innocent but strong young lady was betrayed by the pretentious young male whos aspiring for the throne of the kingdom of his own country since both of them are orphans no moral issues can interfere with their goals but while maleficent becoming a strong yet caring semigoddess of her realm her counterpart in the humans world still wants the throne but not through some noble deed but as a merit of his servitude evil humans preferably males claim the right for the neighboring country of fairies but fail miserably in their attempt and maleficent fends off the attack with no problem so the king puts a bounty on her head and who else but the onetime lover of the strongest fairies can seduce and bereft her from her wings so mother nature i mean maleficent becomes vengeful waiting for her time to come turning into the evil fairy weve all been waiting for in the meantime for his servitude the little orphan becomes the king of his homeland forgetting about his fairylover and marring a beautiful human being who has all the characteristics of a devoted humble wife she gives life to the young princess aurora and actually her part of the story ends here we never see her again the storyline shows only here some reminiscence of the original tale maleficent bestowing the little child with her curse but from there the story evolves into another path maleficent carefully watching over her cursed goddaughter since the inapt fairies are unable to fulfill their task as babysitters little aurora becoming a young innocent blooming lady caring for nature and her surroundings not knowing of her true origin meets maleficent by chance and the two becoming friends  once maleficent even trying to withdraw her own curse while she is

honestly dont know what to do with my manhood?oh imdb seriously? i trust your ratings and always check before deciding whether to watch or not i was not furious on my money or my time being wasted like that but did anyone ever thought giving 8+ ratings would put this movie in the league of godfather the shawshank redemption the lord of the ring series goodfellas star wars and likes its utter disrespect and blasphemous for these great movies to put this good for nothing movie and listed and counted among them to praise boyhood as a masterpiece is actually a slap in the face of all those directors who put a real effort into creating works of art that have real value just because you took 12 years filming this doesnt mean you get to get a 99% rt and an 84 imdb without deserving it okay let me see what was this movie about? nothing 12 freaking years of shooting for what? what really happened there? first of all there was no plot no story whatsoever it shows look a boy was 9 playing with his sister fighting with his sister eating macaroni going to bathroom he got taller grew his hair he cut them back grew them again hes eating going to bathroom again drinking kissing a girl breaking up with a girl going to college oh come on thats what kids do they grow up right? the film which is much too long follows an unstable family and focuses on the life of mason a character that has absolutely no interesting characteristics whatsoever hes not a hero not a zero not a lover not a loser not a fighter not even a dreamer theres nothing about this character that will pause you and let you think about it mr linklater couldnt even catch any memorable scene out of it i appreciate his movie shooting technique but there should be more of it since boyhood supposed to be a story about a boys life his inner world his feelings his dream or his struggle growing up his happinesssadness but there is no depth at all for instance i was once a kid now im grown up i saw my life then how my times were my thoughts my actions my dreams etc it could have been like mason as boy how were his thoughts by the time he was growing up what changes he had to face in his adulthood how he struggled or how he enjoyed what was his dream how he adapted with his struggling family instead mr linklater showed some ordinary does not mean they needs to be extraordinary folks leading lives where nothing happened at all this is a not a growing up story this is certainly not a movie about teenage crisis in fact this movie is about nothing so thats the point? call this 12yearsgimmick a masterpiece? oh come on give me a breaknothing we havent seen you already know is about ai so the first 15 minutes resembling robocop or any other futuristic movie are slow with nothing to add to the plot all along the movie you already know whats going to happen there is no twist at all i can summarize it in one sentence ai goes out of control in the most lineal way visual effects are ok but very repetitive there must be at least 10 shots of people healing themselves after getting shot it reminded me of zombie movies i cant understand why guys like bradd pitt with world war z or johnny depp with this movie are taking part in these kinds of productions what a disappointmentnote if you read my review please vote so that i know if you found my review helpful or not for that matter thanks this movie has johnny depp  this statement alone should suffice but for the sake of humanity i will try to elaborate many years from now if the world is destroyed by nucular holocaust global warning or some such calamity and then an alien ship lands on earth and them aliens get to watch transcendence most probably on bluray with high definition surround sound from the cloud they will regret not reaching the earth earlier they will also have to accept the fact that they could never reach the level of mankind after watching this movie they would laugh if someone told them that marlon brando and lawrence olivier were probably some of the best actors this movie proves that usa movie industry is million miles  no light years  ahead of bollywood movie industry if you just read the end credits you will know that my statement is true never has bollywood been able to have so many americaan names in their credits whereas this movie alone has screens full of bollywood cgi guys if this trend is continued after sometime hollywood will have no technicians to work with and have to give up moviemaking altogether some jealous people have mentioned that this movie is a copy of bicentennial man which is an outright lie transcendence is absolutely fundamentally different from bicentennial man for example the scientist in bicentennial man does not wear glasses also the robot there is not called dr will caster for those others who say that transcendence has borrowed from i robot and twlight zone etc i say only two words cia conspiracy oops i so sound like kevin trudeau i strongly believe that cia used some covert technique such as staring at goats to extract the thoughtwaves of depp as he claimed he has been planning for this movie for the past 10 years and then has given those ideas to bollywood movie makers to diminish american read hollywood achievement even when hollywood makes a movie entitled dances with wolves there is no wolves dancing in the movie and that alone shows how far ahead the tamil film industry in comparison to hollywood is some reviewers have stated that this movie would win all the oscar awards one has also mentioned cannes since movies such as terminator godzilla i robot transformers and others  all of which are made based on concepts stolen from parts of endhiran by a method i mentioned earlier hint cia was involved  have won so many oscar and cannes awards transcendence is bound to surpass them all by winning in all categories at the oscars and cannes negative points the only negative point of this movie is its short length this movie should have been at least 6 hours long for detailed character development and other aspects if simple movies such as once upon a time in america which neither had songs nor cgi could be 4 hours long transcendence the greatest movie ever made surely should have been at least 6 hours long on second thought i also think that the number of songs is too less for such an epic movie with the honorable mr depp sorry if the spellings are wrong note if any of you would like to say something personally to me you may please write to me at pinchashodi at yahoo com thanksnot worth a visit to the theater totally clumsy and amateurish ignorant of the most basic cinematography completely out of pace absolutely no sense of time rendering the plot is so unstructured that its just a mess eg we are introduced to the prince then he disappears then he reappears and thats it so lifeless that editing seems like the land of lost opportunities there no actual interplay between scenes they just follow one another in mere succession no character development for example you get no sensible feel of who the three fairies are and why they behave like they do a repetitiveness of emotions the scenes with maleficent and the beauty are the same and the same and the same no escalation nowhere throughout youd expect the scene where maleficent becomes who she is to be a tower of power but no they could not even get a single scene right the final battle is so out of rhythm that its just a bore instead of having your beat rising the storyline is just a plain line to sum up it feels like a high school production of a play written by children in all this mess angelina could be nothing but flat as if steppedover by an elephant just a long puzzled snore shame cause it really could be an awesome movie but thats what you get when you hire a guy robert stromberg who has never directed before  for your 200000000 movie and they say hollywood is conservative and unadventurous i m pretty sure that the 75 is not untouched after all it cost 200000000 and they have to make sure they get their money back i m also sure that after it runs its course the real rating will be revealed to be much worsenot that funny at all it was a total embarrassment this was one of those movies in which i wish i could have put a bag over my head while walking out the theater because i was too embarrassed for people to see that i had gone to this movie the good ol f word seems to make up most of the script the movie was filled with stupid scenes very little of anything original came out of this film i thought the scene with freebird blasting would never end this was just plain embarrassing tell the writers and producers to please make some better movies than this im really trying to forget i went to this movie so this gets two thumbs downnot sure how this movie has such good reviews it is one of the most boring and dumb movies i have ever seen in my entire life this is 2 12 hours of my life i will never get back do yourself a favor and dont waste your time on this garbage i honestly gave it a shot i watched the thing the whole way though about 14 of the way through the movie i really wanted to turn it off it just didnt keep my interest the ending makes it even worse and just puts the icing on the cake for a terrible freaking movie i am glad i didnt go to see this in the movies because i would have demanded to get my money back i am usually pretty open minded when it comes to movies there have been a few ive seen that are like wow that was terrible this is definitely one of those in my opinionnot only did everything happen way too fast it didnt make much sense either as it was told to us near the end he was the more or less same person as before death doing everything not because of his own desire but because of the women he lovesd what she wanted was explained and he did exactly that being able to heal the planet being able to cure diseases and injuries enhance and watch over literally everything just why in the name of pickles did he decided to throw everything away? his processing capabilities were supposed to be beyond comprehension and the best thing he could come up with was basically sending the world back to the stone age? and people were actually lining up behind this idea? lets see no communication no worth of money no medication no order no disaster recovery its the end of economy so what comes are spreading sicknesses starvation maybe a few wars here and there just to spice it up a little its pure chaos and anarchy nothing more so against the wishes heal the planet to help people of the most important person to him against his owndesire to keep her alive he was like ah screw it that the blondie wouldve shot the other guy my apologies im not good with names is yet again irrelevant with the power at his fingertips he wouldve been able to recover him as well but killing off his love himself and probably billions more is sure a better idea and please dont try the people fear what they dont know or they were scared it would take over the world bull**** because with just an ounce of intelligence theyd have realized that the upcoming suffering and deaths of this new dark age and more suffering and deaths in this still imperfect world is no better option than the worst case scenario the hive mind and loss of individuality order prosperity and evolution again that was the worst case scenario which was not at all the case personally i find it difficult to understand his everything but logical decisions to put it lightly for me this movie was simply horrible an awful experience ps i do not exactly care about the actors the acting the serenity the animations or anything elseat all i am talking about the story the plot nothing elseno spoiler needs to be flagged here it was spoiled from the start 165 minutes of nothing a waste of film and 13 years i havent watched a movie boring in years at best patricia arquette was almost ray light however the movie was so bad i even got tired of seeing her if i had rented this movie at redbox for $1 it wouldnt have been worth it cartoons have more depth im not sure how this movie is up for any award unless maybe a golden raspberry since it took 13 years you could give the golden raspberry for lifetime achievementno need for a spoiler here the ending is so bizarre unbelievable and pretentious it is the type of ending a hollywood director on lsd might make that being said nolan does make the 5th dimension a realitystupidity i cant believe the yawning of 10s and 9s i guess you cannot trust the critics or the movie audience anymore if you believe that movies should be believable coherent and enjoyable then you fail the test to see this move period so my advice to you is simple read the book first oh wait there is no book? that is because there isnt a publishing company that would print it let me give you a line from the movie and you tell me if it is worth seeing who are they? i dunno but they are real and wanted us to be here that is because we are they oooookaaaynever posted on imdb before and i never thought i would but this time i had to i am a movie buff watched thousands of films and i love it i was looking forward to this movie great reviews and 84 on imdb i never read reviews listen to my friends or ever watch trailers because i like going in with a clean slate thats when ive had my best film experiences try it this movie is garbage i love finchers work but he failed miserably at this one so the movie starts out as an interesting dramathriller with the usual effects then it turns over to black comedysatire with the same direction?? i couldnt believe the last third ive never seen this many plot holes in any movie unbelievable garbagemy goodness where do we start? first of all the many 10s this got must have come from the cast and crew or a bunch of people with the scientific knowledge of a 3yrold nolan must know nothing about real science he bandies wormholes and anomolies around like he really knows what they are had there not been so many high paid actors in this it probably would have never been filmed at all just shows that putting big hollywood stars in a movie doesnt guarantee a good product in the end i wont go into all the flaws and idiotic ideas mentioned but just imagine a movie with less scientific expertise than the old 60s show lost in space will robinson and his robot were more believable than anything shown in this laughable attempt at a science fiction movie the biggest irony is that the whole point of the movie was to save humanity as soon as possible by finding a new planet to live on yet they didnt even get back the first time for 23 years and when they return nothing has changed on earth at all his kids are grown but they still live in the same run down house and michael caine who was about 80 when they left seems not to have aged at all when they get back and the crops that were supposed to be dying off causing the death of humanity all look exactly the same still acres and acres of corn fields waiting to be harvested every time they tried to say something intelligent the audience laughed no one in the theater took this movie seriously at all sad because they might have done so much with this idea had they incorporated people who understood space travel and general science bottom line this was a low budget script with a load of expensive actors what a wastemost overrated show ive seen ever i know that a lot of tv is awful but gets swallowed up because people do not venture far from the mainstream dumbed down hypnotic crap which constantly flows through the screen like a sewage pipe however i did not know that the amount of people who are this uncultured and blind to any critical thought was this huge imdb used to be still is in many cases its a good site either way a reliable source for figuring out whether a showfilm was worth looking into put seeing the high ratings of arrow which is 82 at the time of this being written and the latest hunger games movie ive lost hope the spoiler free premise rich brat kid goes on a boat trip with his dad hes got a coke problem and lacks moral and discipline boat sinks everyone dies except him he manages to maroon himself on an island during this time he somehow manages to survive without any food nor drinking water and probably with some bad coke withdrawal symptoms he makes a bow out of what he can find on the island gets really good at hunting animals and survives long enough for another ship to find him well this doesnt seem too bad leaving out some of the backstory and other revelations of course but for some reason he is now a parkour master with martial arts skills hacking skills did he practice on a homemade computer he built out of wood and bear skin or something maybe he powered it by putting a propeller in a tube and farting really hard to make a windturbine? now what he should have done on that island is trained on his damn acting because it blows if i was an actor in la trying to make a name for myself i would of bought the boxset and hit myself in the head repeatedly until i died from head trauma but if that isnt horrible enough the entire cast share the most stale unnatural awful awful acting abilities as the lead it wouldnt have surprised me if the director got blown by every single member of the cast to be on this god forsaken show its just so sad to see resources which could have fed starving children go to waste on this melodrama of an actionshow too bad dramas require acting which the cast does not suffice to provide it should be called bags of skin who might actually be robots reciting the terrible writing of a talentless person on camera held by another talentless person who somehow managed to get payed and recognized in a extremely tough business instead of acting in this case the style of this series is extremely similar to smalville with a lot of bright light and water drops in the eyes of the pretty female actresses to make them look better which is the one thing they actually can do for the most part with the oily 80s pornflick filter and the halfarsed special effects though smallville actually being a half decent show gets a pass there was one scene i laughed out loud at it wasnt actually the scenes where the directorwriter intended it to be funny because those scenes were so tryhard funny that i literally cringed it was a scene where mr arrow shoots an arrow next to this generic bad guys head the bad guy says hah you missed whereas mr arrow replies i didnt lol apparently he shot the the arrow which actually had a flashdrive instead of a tip into the usb slot behind the bad guy which also contained a virus which mr arrow had taught himself to program on the island or something? which brought down the evil database epic haha great writing indeed no clichs included i actually dislike this series so much i feel good writing how awful it is maybe i can discourage a single person to watch this lobotomy of a show and that would be enough to make me feel glad tldr horrendous acting clichridden awful holeridden unoriginal and uninspiring writing horrendous acting overrated by people who would drink the koolaid as long as the trailer had explosions in it directing and special effects on high school film project standards thats actually insulting to high schoolers since they actually have creativity sorry acting horrendous terrible makeup jokes and humour about as hilarious as reading obituaries

trying to understand this movies plot every other minute some guy takes off a mask so i had a very difficult time understanding who are the good guys and who are the bad guys and im not stupid i think the creators of this film went a little bit too far in trying to surprise the viewer all they achieved is a lot of confusion if youre interested in watching a surprising and understandable movie go watch the gamemindless entertainment usually has some charm to it if nothing else guardians delivers none of that throughout the whole film it provided maybe two sincerely funny moments while the rest of it came across mostly as unintentional comedy thanks to a gibberish script ive never laughed at someone dying of cancer before but the prologue of guardians is just so hilariously godawful it had me in stitches all through the opening credits oh christ what a forgettable uninteresting and pitifully bland mess of a film this was i suppose it appeals to easily impressionable simpletons but i struggle to see how theres hardly any character development the plot is nonsense from start to finish the antagonist is some bland and boring caricature who seemingly only exists as a vehicle to introduce thanos who is a big deal im assuming? and its all just so damn predictable perhaps worst of all the ending is just another anticlimactic retread of the old and tired power of love trope i may have given guardians at least one point if it had decent effects and camera work put into it but none of that is to be found heremementothe dark knight trilogy the prestige inception and moneyball there all pretty decent films wouldnt you say? one thing that all those films had in common is the fact they were all overseen in a dop sense by renowned cinematography wally pfister dont even try say that last name correctly christopher nolans go to cinematographer until his recent upcoming interstellar working with nolan on his modern day classics wouldve taught you a thing or two about the thinking mans blockbuster wouldnt you say? well sadly with transcendence it looks like wally didnt listen in class looking to debut his directing career with a scifi not dissimilar to the large thinking themes of inception pfister has gone for the knockout straight away and left himself completely exposed to the blows that a weak storyline shoddy editing and mismanaged performances will deal out transcendence looks to delve deep into the modern day tech filled world that is increasingly blurring the lines between what it is to be human and human emotion being overtaken by artificial intelligence its a high end concept and a concept no doubt ripe for exploration yet pfister doesnt lay hold on any firm grip of his subject that gets lost in an uninteresting love story badly played jumps in time and a finale that not only feels rushed but feels horribly underdeveloped much like the movies performances stealing previous nolan acting collaborators in the forms of rebecca hall still crying out for a decent role cillian murphy morgan freeman and lucas haas its clear that pfister was able to draw some serious talent to his tale mix these actors in with johhny depp paul bettany and kate mara and the recipe was all there to provide one of this years most unique and intriguing ensembles the cast however here is universally terrible working with material that is clearly underdeveloped the increasingly acting for hire type role by johnny depp comes off worse as will caster but there is no one staking a claim here for acting honours in what is a showcase for pfisters inability to draw out commanding performances something his teacher nolan has always been able to achieve transcendence has a few neat visual tricks up its sleeve which is to be expected for a man whos given us some of recent cinemas most iconic imagery but even these flourishes cannot paint over the fact that the film is a complete mishmash of half cooked ideas uninteresting dramatics and weak acting efforts somewhere deep inside this tale something is waiting to burst to life but this is one startlingly bad debut by a cinematographer that should be on the phone to some of his old mates begging for his job back as his latest career move looks to have stalled before it really even began half an abnormal raindrop out of 5 for more movie reviews and opinions check out

dust cloud follows the pickup as they plough through the cornfield chasing a drone this is a totally unexplained encounter the family are so busy watching the drone that they nearly drive over a cliff even though they are on their own land perhaps because they are driving the pickup blind yet fast enough to keep up with a jetpowered drone hello??? no intelligible explanation for how mm landed the drone what he found in it how a groovy pile of dust helped him find the space station nor why they hired him to fly the mission why should michael caine be the nasa project director  he is hardly an obvious rocket scientist why such a bizarre robot? and did it wake them all up before the worm hole  or did i miss how that was to happen in the mumbles lo and behold  despite having travelled for months to the wormhole end near saturn they find themselves right beside a suitable planet at the other end but i guess that was the work of them it is key to the plot but there is no scientific concept that would make 1 hour on a planet into 7 years and how come the open sea is paddleable and a vast tsunami appears? despite the size of the waves all is immediately calm and they seem to be predictable stuck some equally improbable idea was going to solve this problem but id lost interest it is the moment i walked out the movie to that point was uninteresting and wholly illogical i really thought with all the hype it would be compelling instead it was plain irritating anne hathaway was okay at least we could hear what she was saying and we could hear everyone else for that matter poor miscast good ol boy matthew i have now read the wikipedia synopsis which is likewise unintelligible and am hugely glad that i left  even though i have wasted one hour of the two hours i saved by writing this reviewman oh man this movie was terrible how this got an 86 is beyond me and in fact thats what i went based off of and luckily never really go to movies now days because of all the crappy movies hollywood pumps out there is nothing to this movie i went with a friend and i literally kept falling asleep every now and then looking at my watch hoping it will be over its just an empty movie all action with no story nothing just some shooting here and there and stupid jokes all recent movies like this including the new amazing spiderman 2 are just terrible movies with nothing to them hollywood is just a cash cow now and this is why i refuse to pay for movies in theatresmaleficent was marvelously shot with beautiful effects and a dark and dreary setting that let you escape from your normal everyday world it even had some good performances but besides that dont even waste a dollar at redbox to see this piece of crap what in the world got into their head that made them warn to change the original character? in order to change that character they had to reroute the entire storyline and transform beloved strong willed characters into weak and stupid characters or good willed characters into evil one dimensions ions psychopaths and make a very important character pretty much pointless to the story okay from here on there are spoilers if you have not seen the movie do not read on maleficent was changed into a weak and clichd piece of crap character to try in promote strong female roles in other films but she was only taken to a deeper level of weakness in the original she was strong and evil and she didnt have to have a back story because her story wasnt the main story she even turned into a stinking dragon in this version she was symbolically raped then she went all stereotypical and clich strong girl on us and decided to get revenge on her ex lover only this time she just cursed his daughter come on i mean thats not even exact revenge thats just stupidity if i were her idve killed the sucker immediately and just not worry about the daughter and then she tries to help the girl age cursed by attempting to break it how does being an antagonist with a heart of gold translate with audiences? uh not very well on top of that they changed her into a hero halfway through for no good reason at all except to make disney happy so its not like ultra dark unfortunately while doing this they ruined the dragon not only was maleficent not the one that transformed into the dragon it only took the soldiers like a total of 30 seconds to bring it down i mean seriously i counted then to top off this review i cant forget prince phillip the strong hearted prince who comes to save his true love for the evil sorceress only in this version hes a random guy who says hello to aurora once then gets this absurd infatuation with her and gets it into his head that he wants to kiss her then theres stephan and the fairies which if youve seen the movie dont even

with her and gets it into his head that he wants to kiss her then theres stephan and the fairies which if youve seen the movie dont even need an explanationmaleficent is the very first movie in my long list of movies that i have seen that i wanted to walk out of lets start with the positives angelina jolie was incredible she was beautiful she was strong and she executed maleficent beautifully her relationship with aurora was refreshing and nice the magical world was something that has been seen on movies like bridge to terabithia but it was still beautiful and engaging but all of this does not save the movie i expected to walk in and see a movie similar to wicked where we get a better understanding of the bad guy yes us understanding the bad guy does not excuse what they have done but we can see where they come from in the musical wicked and even in the movie great and powerful oz we have sympathy for the character we previously viewed as the bad guy we could see where she was coming from in those adaptations nobody truly ended up becoming the bad guy most were victims of circumstances in maleficent? it was ferngullyavatar all over again magical people good man baaaaaad instead of giving depth to all the characters that previously were left rather flat and on the background on the original sleeping beauty suddenly the king has been reduced to this one dimensional villain that created the evil maleficent and later on becomes obsessed with killing her he was given no aspects that would make us have even the tiniest bit of sympathy not the smallest bit of understanding he was just a vile man that broke maleficents heart mutilated her and cared only for power even when he tried to protect his daughter it was made appear more like he was protecting his property rather than a person he loved yes he graveled for her for a bit begging maleficent not to curse her but that was it the movie left all traces of the good of the humanity from it ok it had some of the good of humanity but the only human that was portrayed as good was aurora the movie tried to portray the three fairies as the comic relief but ended up just portraying them as idiots incompetent selfish creatures the fairies in the original disney movie were clumsy and unused to taking care of a child but they were like that because for the first time in their lives they could not rely on their magic to achieve things in life if were as modern people were thrown in to the middle of the woods and had to do everything by hand then yes we would be as lost as they were but they were given 16 years to evolve to learn and to grow but no the fairies were not given even the smallest of story arc in this movie they were creatures that switched sides when ever it benefited the movie i mentioned before that i liked the relationship that maleficent and aurora had in the movie but even that was shattered later on in the movie the solution to the problem was not a surprise at all it was taken straight out of frozen it was refreshing and incredible when frozen did it because it was the first time disney did not use the age old solution of a man being the one delivering the kiss of true love but when the same solution the same realization is done in a movie that came out within year of each other? it is boring and in no way exiting it is in no way entertaining we have learned nothing new is this disneys new approach in relationship? love between man and a woman is obsolete but the love between girl family kind of love not lesbian kids apparently cant handle that and also family excludes male family members at this moment as well only women can feel true loveis the strongest of all the loves in this world in the end the movie basically told the audience yeah the moviestory that has been told for decades is actually a propaganda and i should know because i am queen aurora and i was there all along the original sleeping beauty was rather black and white good vs evil when i walked in to the theatre i expected the lines to be blurred to be thought all stories have two sides not all of our actions are blatantly good or evil but instead the writers and directors and what nots decided to make the line between good and evil even more visible the good creatures are good no matter what they do and the bad humans are bad and rotten all the way in conclusion the movie might have given some depth to a villain that previously had been left as a rather one dimensional character but in exchange they created a new one dimensional villain just switching the genders around the worlds was beautiful and the lead actress was amazing but even she could not save this rehash of a movie in the endmaleficent attempts to tell an old story anew but all it does is completely redefine the title characters personality without taking the time to create a feasible explanation and alternative to the well known fairytale in disneys new maleficent we first see maleficent as a young girl with magnificent wings she is the largest fairy and protector of the magical moors from the greedy humans in another nearby kingdom she meets a human stefan who befriends her and she eventually falls in love with him only to be betrayed by his selfish and sinful humannature this is the new and unknown backstory that motivates the maleficent we know from the animated disney narrative children will enjoy this movie it is beautifully designed and full of wonderful scenery with magical creatures and talking trees disney plays into the innocence of children and fascination they have for nature and capitalize on it there is the darkness of a discernible villain and the light of a righteous hero adults and fans of the fairy tale will be disappointed the film is drawn out because no story progresses nor evolution occurs within maleficent the plot is flimsy weak and completely inconsistent with the narrative and poorly conceptualized nothing makes any sense and the title characters behavior is neither explained with a backstory nor revealed as a sad misunderstanding the writers try to make you believe that maleficent endured the ultimate betrayal and by her closest most trusted loved one there is absolutely no proof of this with the exception of a fabulously believable freak out by angelina jolie when she awakens to find herself mutilated no wonderful love story involving the future king stefan is shown and the first five minutes should only exist on the editing room floor there is a nice sentiment behind the makers intentions but the entire story is unrefined like a first draft director robert stromberg is new and it shows he lacks the confidence ability and experience to take the initiative and lead the story the writer linda woolverton is most at fault in her creation of a feeble unconvincing and baseless story executives should have used some of their $180million dollar budget on consulting with gregory maguire then there would be an intelligent logical but beautiful plot and woolverton could do what she does best create a screenplay to match now for the worst party of the film the fairy god mothers oh dear lord what have they done to the fairy godmothers? they are flighty imbecilic selfabsorbed twits since the story is so moronic the fairy involvement in raising aurora is explained with an impractical sentence as is most of the film then they spend the whole 16 years they are supposedly watching aurora by complaining about its inconvenience and arguing like the three stooges elle fanning is not the enchanting aurora and her aurora is annoyingly cloying they try to make it seem like this profound love exists for aurora from maleficent angelina jolie looks like maleficent she has the stature the prowess the harsh beauty and the outfit but little else sadly she never really acts and her accent is slacking she just stands and glares i never sense malice anger love betrayal or anything for that matter and certainly not ominous villainous evil i am supposed to believe she has a quiet strength from her power? no im guessing stromberg was taken by her beauty and celebrity and thought that sufficient with a flimsy story bad acting and a complete disregard for the storys structure the whole thing is preposterous is creating a harmonious rational account where a fairy turns evil really that difficult? or did executives hope that nobody would notice behind the cloak of the disneyjolie name i never felt anything watching this movie especially considering the immense power a disney

tortuous experience for me i sat there forcing myself to finish it forcing myself to forgive its shortcomings praying for something profound to hit me i think the film really shows linklaters failure to connect with the generation he attempts to portray hell use a pop song or a shot of an ipod or some other cheap reference to suggest a specific moment in time but his perspective is that of an ignorant adult oversimplifying or completely misinterpreting the internal experience of childhood maybe thats why so many critics identify with the film because they like many adults suffer from the same disillusionment when failing to understand young people today and why are there so many onedimensional characters in this film? this is inexcusable the lead actor the sister the mother the two alcoholic step fathers the girlfriends the most interesting character is by far the dad played by ethan hawke who is actually a complex human being like the rest of us who grows always trying to guide his son and impart wisdom where he can even when unqualified everyone else is a shadow of a borderline offensive clich why arent more critics mentioning this? the lead was clearly cast because he was a goodlooking kid there obviously isnt a single acting bone in his body he doesnt even seem interested in anything there is a dull lifelessness in his performance i cant help but think linklater views teenagers as dull lifeless emotionless creatures i give the filmmakers credit for experimenting with their creativity and committing to the process but is this really the best picture frontrunner?

family problems in american culture etc  but the other 2 hrs was really disappointing while the timeline of actors and culture serves to make this movie somewhat unique there wasnt much of a plot other than this is what its like in real life in which case it would be a documentary but it was not there was a good introduction in the 1st houri was still waiting to anticipate how the plot would go but not much buildup no climax and no resolution pretty disappointing to what i thought might be a good storylisten im not a smart man but i have basic reasoning skills and common sense now whilst i understand that scifiction doesnt follow the rules of reality suspension of disbelief and all there still has to be coherency rules and order however fantastical within the made up world so that people buy into the movie this movie lacks those attributes in spades and is a bitch slap to the viewers intelligence in one snippet of the three hour nonsense youll endure and i do mean endure the intrepid saviors of the world decide to check out a water planet because their predecessor sent a beacon that this was a viable planet for new earth but within minutes of their landing on two inches of water they realize that a giant wave had smashed their scout to bits promptly after she landed years before and they were about to suffer the same fate but oh happy day they manage to escape wasting only a few hours of their time but decades of earth time well that sucks but it makes sense that they had to check it out right? not when you realize they could have avoided the watery planet from hell if the first scout hadnt sent out a beacon saying the planet was viable in the first place after all how could she know that in the mere minutes between when she landed and was then smashed to bits?? nice to know that when the fate of mankind is in the balance a responsible scientist would jump to such a rushed conclusion hey guys i just landed here looks great come now xoxo then you have another scientist on another planet who was supposedly selflessly brave enough to go on a oneway trip to scout a planet then chicken shis out when he gets there and realizes its not viable and hes a dead man so selfishly dooms mankinds one chance by having them waste their limited resources to get there just to unwittingly rescue him but then decides he can still save mankind by killing his rescuers so that he can complete the mission all by himself holy whiplash with his conflicting moralitiesimmoralities batman i could go on and on but i wont i conclude by saying it really irks me when a movie like this gets lauded as a masterpiece when its really just acid tripping rubbishlike many others i was shocked by how bad this movie was and the many plot holes its hard to know where to startamy being sent home from the hospital still covered in blood was one low point i also agree with the earlier reviewer who says the movie is antifemale empowerment it makes the commentators on tv talking about domestic violence seem like the enemybecause you know at that point the husband is wrongly accused so you see the women talking about husbands murdering wives on the pseudonancy grace talk show as false accusers and man haters very disturbing however i wrote this review to point out one plot hole one very big plot hole nobody else seemed to notice again spoiler here amy is a psychopath supposedly the whole story turns on the idea that she is sociopathic and abusive and has been for years witness her framing of the exboyfriend 8 years earlier why then does she givelend her parents almost her entire trust fund simply because they ask? it is already established that they care more for fictional amazing amy than for her her reason at the end of the day the trust fund is really their money huh? thats how a psychopath sociopath thinks about parents she doesnt like? or was it part of her evil plan all along to end up broke in missouri so she could start to hate her husband and try to frame him? sarcasm its just dumb how did this movie and book get such great buzz? i left the movie wondering sadly is this what people like now? btw i watched this with a largely college age audience who laughed several times especially when amy flips her nonbloodsoaked blond hair at the end of the bloody murder scene at then laughed again when the credits were rollinglike many others i was disappointed with the fact that for the big screen almost all the elements which made the tv series mission impossible so entertaining  the team ethos the complex contricks etc  were jettisoned in favour of a huge ego boost for the one man show that is mr tom cruise it is particularly annoying given that the plot chosen to replace it is so bogstandard and predictable an honest hero is framed for something he didnt do and spends the rest of the movie trying to clear his name and out the real spy this seems to be the plot of every third blockbuster these days  two titles released just before mi using exactly the same storyline spring to mind judge dredd and schwarzeneggers eraser it was also totally unnecessary to take the hero of the original series and make him the villain of the movie  can you imagine a film version of the untouchables with the cops hot on the trail of the evil gang boss eliot ness? there is also the fact that the movie is deeply insecure one feels that it would like to be a coldwar style espionage picture but does not have the courage of its convictions so tacks a cheesy and implausible action sequence onto the end i could go on but at the end of the day my list of criticisms are all are all pretty subjective and dont really point to this being a bad film simply one that i dont like but then suddenly it struck me the reason i find this movie so intensely pointless and the reason i think its no good is that so many scenes are so stupid or just completely extraneous take for example the films most memorable moment  the break in to the cia building to steal half of the noc list we are told that this is the most secure room in the entire world that it has every security system known to man except it seems a plain and simple good old cctv camera sure the scene is well directed and a fair amount of tension is wrung from it but if you take a step back to think its preposterous besides by my reckoning there is no reason for hunt even to have the real noc list if he is planning on double bluffing simply to smoke out the spy so the scene shouldnt even be there why would he endanger all those agents by handing over the real list? nit picking? certainly but it sums up for me why the whole thing is a waste of time there are plenty of movies one can enjoy by checking ones brain in at the theatre door but when a movie cloaks itself in a supposedly complex plot and encourages the audience member to engage his or her brain and then doesnt even stand up to scrutiny i find the whole process deeply depressing  more so when the film takes itself as seriously as this one evidently does i cant even be entertained anymore because i am acutely aware of how shallow empty and ultimately pretentious it all is so sorry folks but if you ask me this is a red herring wrapped up in a macguffin wrapped up in a shaggy dog story with fleas all designed for the sole purpose of making tommy look good its a real shame that the supporting cast production values direction etc are all so high since the film itself is so thoroughly worthless at my most generous id give it 410like many other reviewers im giving this a 1 in a feeble attempt to balance out all the unwarranted 10s i keep seeing even though i really think it deserves a 5 or maybe a 6 i actually created an account just to do this so i figured i might as well include a review along with my rating many will say try to tell you that you shouldnt attempt to compare this movie to 2001 that they are two totally different movies etc this is ridiculous they are quite similar on multiple levels with interstellar obviously taking many cues and inspirations from kubricks masterpiece i feel that if we compare the two we can get a good idea of where nolans film went wrong the main reason 2001 has remained so powerful and held up so well is that it doesnt try to explain and rationalize everything that happens we see the events of the movie unfold but as the movie nears its psychedelic conclusion we are really left to our own guesswork as to what is going on has he entered another dimension? an alternate universe? an alien spacecraft? is he just dead? the mere fact that we have no idea whether this scene depicts something spiritual something scientifically quantifiable or a mix of the two makes it so much more moving than if kubrick had tried to explain it through the available science of his time interstellar answers far too many questions which as is often the case ends up raising infinitely more nolan makes it clear from the get go that this film is supposed to function on more of an emotional level than a scientific one then why even bother have the film fact checked by a astrophysicist? why create this confusing mixture of real and pseudo science in the first place? to me in a lot of scenes this kind of shatters the air of mysticism nolan seemed to be going for the floating bookcase in a black hole sequence for instance seemed really magical until cooper suddenly has a bunch of epiphanies and becomes positive that the structure was created by future humans not aliens that they created it specifically for him so he could navigate 5d and communicate with his daughter and that he can save the world only by manipulating a watch with gravity boom there goes all the mystery and lets assume his theory is correct and this structure was indeed constructed by mankind from the future hmmm guess it turns out that we didnt perish from constant dust storms after all‹instead we survived hundreds of thousands of years into the future and went on to create mindblowing interdimensional space technology then what exactly is future us so worried about? they seem to be doing just fine without any alteration of the past this is just the tip of the iceberg as far as far as all of the inconsistencies and unanswered questions youll find in this movie if you have a very analytical mind steer clear of it‹i am not a mathy or sciencey person by any stretch yet even i struggled at times to put my logic in the backseat and just enjoy the ride thats what id advise you to do if you want to have a good time watching this movie dont overthink it if you can just do that youll find an entertaining film with truly stunning visual effects a great if maybe a little too over the top score from hz and very convincing performances from the actors i found some scenes very moving i liked the concept of a future that as a result of a technological lull doesnt look very different from our present there are a lot of positive things to say about this film and yet the end result is sadly maybe just a couple pegs above mediocrelike its protagonist kenneth branaghs liveaction adaptation of the disney animated classic cinderella proves to be little more than a dull vapid mess covered up by a sparkly blue dress and no amount of computergenerated mice slapstick pumpkins or good old fashioned bonham carter charm can save it once again director branagh shows that the only thing he does better than shakespeare is soulless cgi spectacle everyone is familiar with the cinderella story and being that this particular iteration makes no effort to diverge from the triedtrue fairy tale anyway this critic shall not waste any time in summarizing it to be brief heroine ella  cinderella being a derogatory nickname cooked up by her

proves to be little more than a dull vapid mess covered up by a sparkly blue dress and no amount of computergenerated mice slapstick pumpkins or good old fashioned bonham carter charm can save it once again director branagh shows that the only thing he does better than shakespeare is soulless cgi spectacle everyone is familiar with the cinderella story and being that this particular iteration makes no effort to diverge from the triedtrue fairy tale anyway this critic shall not waste any time in summarizing it to be brief heroine ella _ cinderella being a derogatory nickname cooked up by her

even children are sure to be unimpressed by this obviously mechanical piece of cold corporate cashinlet me start by saying that maleficent has been a personal favorite of mine when it comes to disney villains throughout her many interpretations she has simply been evil yes with a capital e so forgive me if this review is a bit of a rant in this adaptation she is reinterpreted as a good fairy because shes apparently not a human sorceress anymore? that simply has a hissyfit she is certainly not evil  just angry for a little while she even ends up becoming a godmother?? even king stephens character is butchered why does he go insane over her? if he were really the bad guy why wouldnt he have killed maleficent when he had the chance? what possible reason does he have for being indifferent about the welfare of his daughter? speaking of aurora its worth mentioning that she is relatively alright but still not too close to her original character a petty aesthetic thing about her is that her hair and eyebrows are not the same color which is really distracting additionally they rehash the concept from frozen which is that true love doesnt have to be from some man if this trend continues from disney all well see is sisterlygodmotherlyfamily love movies where romance is thrown out the window because it apparently doesnt end with a happily ever after anymore overall this film was simply horrible if you respected maleficent as a villain if you did like maleficent as she was i dont recommend seeing this movie even if you like the idea of there being no such thing as evil i urge you not to see this movie dont support the people who made itlet me start by saying that i have enjoyed christopher nolans work in the past memento insomnia parts of the batman trilogy i find him a very talented filmmaker with strong ideas and visual sense therefore it makes me very sad to state that categorically this is an absolute turkey in many places the plot is so full of holes that you can do little but laughout loud there will be reviewers on here talking about depth intimations of mortality etc etc forget it this is just a total misfire actors used to say despairingly that they were playing johnny exposition  you know the guy who explains everything to the audience note i said despairingly this has almost every character explaining everything from wormholes to the mystery of love oh yeah after a totally boring drawnout beginning which seems to be there to prove that nolan has watched the grapes of wrath many times over we get the first huge laugh when we meet sir michael caine with a laughable posh  cockney  american accent he is playing the part that sam shephard in this or morgan freeman usually play he is not up to it never was never will be it takes a certain amount of skill to be able to deliver line after line of pseudoscientific gobbledygook and make it sound real caines performance  like so many of his performances  screams out wheres my bleedin paycheck? when coop gary cooper  westerns  get it agrees to fly this practically suicidal mission to the outer reaches of space he blasts off like a cosmic cowboy all bravado and charisma  at which point his fellow crew member shows him  with a pen and paper  what a wormhole is yes when he is leading a flight into outer space a little late doncha think? it gets worse when poor anne hathaway playing as my son said  science girl has to recite a monologue about love and how it can cross all dimensions of space time blah blah blah i really felt for her i wont expand on the plot i couldnt if i wanted to and the last 30 minutes have to be seen to be disbelieved this is not one of those films that you see and forget immediately you will wake up in a few months time laughing at michael caines last scene or his recital of dylan thomas famous lines  not once but twiceand the end oh the end mcconaghey gives it his all having to cry on more than one occasion  believe me i know how he felt dont believe anyone if they tell you you didnt get it thats like saying you didnt get an episode of two and a half men ambitious yes but a turd is a turd  even if they meant to produce a new hybrid roselet me start by saying im certain i would more than struggle to make a better film i am humbled by the energy love and devotion required to produce the few moments that literally flash before our eyes i also consider myself a huge fan of the nolan brothers following memento the prestige inception all films of exceptional quality and fantastic storytelling for years christopher nolan has worked literal movie magic telling his audience exactly what to expect from the very beginning yet delivering a performance that leaves them no less than astounded interstellar begins no different nolan practically hands the ending to the audience leaving little to surprise but unlike previous masterpieces interstellar drags the audience on a painful bumpy ride through space time love and death leaving some in hypnotic wonder the rest simply insulted wishing for nothing more than to get back the past 169 minutes stay a message delivered by cooper to his daughter across space and time and yes we knew it was him all along stay the message potential viewers should hear loud and clear stay home its safe and warm revisit memento the prestige or inception and marvel at the layered depth of stories told so well you ache for them to be told again and again and again perhaps next time the nolans will deliver on that hope until then stay away from interstellarlet me just say that the plot is good the story seems cool the message is good but when you start watching the movie it just gets worse and worse till the end it is a complete waste of time giving you nothing but a bad taste in your mouth this movie really sucks anyone who thinks this movie is great has never seen a good scifi movie before or is on drugs or being paid matthew mcconaughey keeps mumbling threw out the movie absolutely cannot stand the irritating music that booms on boring things trying to keep you interested in actors that dont even do a good job i mean matt? seems like a amateur everyone seemed very lame and there are no aliens there is no life there is nothing to make you go wow you see the same people doing a lot of nothing hoping they all get killed so the movie will end and the logic the science they screw up on their mission and some of the special effects are worse then 1960s doctor who the only thing good about this movie are some of the great cgi scenes other than that i think it is one of the absolute worst scifi movies i have ever seen so many bad things it would take me a year to write it all down it is a classic movie classic as being top 10 of the worse ever scifi made in the last 10 years how can this crap get such high reviews? it is very low budget bad acting bad everything has anyone ever seen star wars star trek? inception? or apocalypse now? if not watch one of these great movies then watch this total crap movie it should get a score of no more then a 4 at the most but the ruining of the actors makes me give it a 1 on top of all the illogical nonsense especially at the end he goes into a black hole? like his body could survive it? but lets just say he could then multi dimensions to where he turns a clock and then that saves humanity somehow? while crashing into a building somehow looking in a window then somehow they build a colony in space that of course he wakes up to a baseball game which is probably the only reason he agreed to do the movie to them rebuilding his old crappy house back home? i mean what the heck? makes no sense at all how did this movie hack the movie rating system?last year i made the horrible mistake of paying and wasting my time to watch frozen in theaters because i thought it would be a great disney classic like tangled finally i can say that something good has come out of watching the overrated trash that is also known as frozen thanks to my terrible experience with disneys frozen i read the entire plot for this movie before watching it thankfully i ended up saving a few bucks as it was evident that this movie like frozen was not worth paying to watch maleficent was basically a nonanimated nonmusical version of frozen apparently disney ran out of ideas and decided to regurgitate the ideas from frozen with different characters wonderful as expected the main point was a rehash of frozens true love between women is better than true love between a man and woman because it sells well after this movie i can officially say that disney has completely lost its magic we are now to believe that dream guys dont exist in fact all men are either extremely evil or just stupid what happened to the brave prince charming in classic disney stories? disney has deserted them and has decided to start making more realistic movies nowadays and by realistic i mean movies with strong independent females who are clearly superior to the men disneys recent movies make me question whether they are even supporting the concept of true love or dreams anymore i grew up in a time where little girls could dream of finding their kind and classy prince charming but wait the people at disney had an epiphany having high expectations for guys is bad instead lets encourage little girls to dream of being bffs with a sister who ignores her for years or becoming her fathers worst enemys goddaughter instead im just thankful i dont have to grow up watching these lame disney movies i truly find disneys efforts in reversing its reputation of true loves kiss just pathetic hmm cynicism in fairy tales? just what we need as a classic disney lover count me out just a few comments 1 prince phillip used to be my favorite disney prince but here i guess hes just another tool used by feminists to shove their message down our throats 2 maleficent doesnt turn into a dragon yup you heard me whats the point of the movie then you ask? i have no idea also as you have probably already guessed theres no intense battle between prince phillip and maleficentasadragon either just splendid 3 why on earth is king stefan the villain? he was infatuated with maleficent and only married queen leila to take over the kingdom? what on earth has disney come to??? this movie is an insult to disneys sleeping beauty stefan>maleficent #teamstefanforlife 4 last but definitely not least whats up with trying to blur the line between good and evil? yes frozen im also looking at you this is by far my biggest issue with recent disney movies im sure walt disney is rolling in his grave actually since he was cremated perhaps i should say that his ashes are turning in his burial plot? either way you get the idea of all the stirring legends of the triumph of good over evil none has ever been so inspirational to me as sleeping beauty  walt disney i hate to say it but disney is dead walt disney however will forever live on in our heartskingsman the secret service  the triumph of bad taste poor script poorly executed the action fake the play of many actors is weak colin firth is good but samuel jackson is ridiculous the music is just noise filthy language in every sentence it left an impression that the people in this movie dont know any language to express their needs or emotions absence of sense of class taste or style the first 5 min was intriguing but the following was boring frustrated my children decided to nap but the typhoon of the torturing noise didnt allow them to relax when the film finally was over people left the room speechless and with relief production of such movies is a confusing message to the youth a terrible disappointmentkingsman is yet another comic book mess this time about a south london petty criminal who is given the chance to join a private intelligence agency only to find himself fighting against both class prejudice and a mad dotcom genius with an aversion to blood who wants to murder most of the population to save the world from global warming its amusing to see a film be disrespectful about obama and agw but the film is morally repulsive and stupid it wants to be a silly but fun globetrotting adventure like old james bond films but those films had wit exotic travel high living and great stunts whilst this film is crude stuffed with fakelooking cgi charmless and has stupid jeopardyfree action scenes i lost count of just how many times the bad guys goons had the hero in their sights but missed him the promised chav to gentleman transformation never occurs  apparently being comfortable with who you are is what makes a gentleman  with the hero starting as a lout and ending up as a lout in a bespoke suit what really sinks the film though is its lack of a moral compass i could complain about the crudity of having a swedish princess offer anal sex to the hero but the real culprit is the way the film mixes comic book sensibilities with hyperrealistic violence people are tortured and cut in half without a qualm worst of all is a sequence in the middle where a hate church full of people are driven mad and kill each other in an orgy of improvised and graphic violence which is shot like an action scene as if it is entertainment and goes on forever if you want to see colin firth brutally and repeatedly stabbing a woman in the stomach then this is the film for youjust seen the film gone girl i really struggled with the book and found it incredulous so never finished it but the film was getting good reviews so i thought id give it a go what a pile of crap two and a half hours of my life wasted the story is just unbelievable neither character makes you like them or hate them they are just bland and well unbelievable by the end i just wanted someone to firebomb the house and kill the pair of them i would have stood up and cheered as it happened it has a really lame ending a waste of my life utter tripejust saw the movie and wasnt a fan interesting premise but i felt some moments it tried to be funny tried to be over the top or even tried to be serious without being interesting it was if the movie was written for specific fight scenes and then pieced together in a rush recommend as a rental but even then it should be low on the list the others i went with had similar opinions with only the argument of which was worse this or jupiter ascending having only seen this one i am rating it a 4 because of the decent acting cool villain and good scorejust like the hobbit movies in which there is 0 real danger for the heroes guardians spends 98% of the time trying to convince you that the guardians are in danger there is no realism no heart to this movie the special ed character i am groot i find to be disturbingkinda like the guy in the ron burgundy movie is he there for laughs? is he there to show that the mentally disabled are just like normal people? conveniently there is no light in a scene so groot just grows pretty glowing light skin flakes from his arm you know for the adult children idiots who liked this film pretty colors tough girl sexy princess check animal character with bad attitude check egotistical smuggler check smugglers friend who turns on him check all powerful bad guy who is betrayed by the next worse bad guy check this movie is a complete rip off of star wars easy escape from detention area check incompetent prison guards check turning off power to escape check i just wanted to puke the action and dialogue belong in a childrens book why does the bad guy hate people? just cause? why does the bad guy suicide his ships instead of use them to shoot down the other planes? why does the bad guy throw people around instead of just killing them because this is a pathetic formula movie with no respect for real adultsjust hate nolan or nolanlovers should i say constant bombardment of science humbug correspondence to theory is not the point contrast it with the silence of 2001 contrast it with the film it tries to imitate now an average scifi story is elevated into the rank of greatest films without even a solid cinematic base except those visuals and effects that become a standard technical expertise you sciencegeniuses all needed this information overload to accept a noteven average story as a cinematic masterpiece how i hope the days come when this movie shall share its honorable place in the dustbin of history alongside battlefield earth or armageddon etc when the nolan fanboys and its industrial franchise fade awayjust dont watch it the movie has plot that has been in some muddle pud for a 3 hours star trek hologram episodes have more sense than this movie its an 3 hour cryfest no sense its not even visually goodugh i want my time back one of the worst movies ever definitely and anyone who says different is lying himself then you this movie has more holes than swiss cheese even prometheus has more logic than this not to mention those ghost whisperer scenes holy god that is so boring drama is expected every 5 minutesevery 5 minutes somebody cries there is 5 minutes of action everything else is just explosion noise and crying and crying and crying and crying just plain horrible mormons have more logic than this moviejust could not believe nolan would have created this junk i could hardly see any action sequence and all i get to see is a family melodrama in the name of a scifi movie the plot is good but the movie clearly missed the direction it needed well the concept of space travel gravity wormhole blackhole all looks good in books to know more about it i would have read the brief history of time again or watched more documents on the theory of relativity or blackholes but to bring it out in reality one has to really evolve a lovely plot which was definitely missing in this movie if it was any other director i would have give it a 5 star but i have always looked upon nolan in the leagues of spielberg james cameron or guy ritchie so for all the great expectations and the disappointment all i could give is 1 star sorry nolan half the theater was empty by the time 1 hr flew and i had a take a short nap while the movie was running at a slow pacejust because this movies gimmick was that it was filmed over 12 consecutive years so you witness the kids growing up does not make this a fantastic movie the script was awful and went no where it was nothing but a series of boring unending vignettes strung together to try and tell a story which it failed to do the characters are onedimensional uninspiring bland and apathetic what child when given a birthday giftteenager or otherwisehas no reaction as if heshe is in a permanent braindead coma? how is that just like real life ? those raving about this movie are just those trying to jump on the bandwagon of the emperors new clothes well spoiler alert the emperor is naked they are saying it is just like real life i dont know anyone who acts like what was portrayed in real life no one outside of patricia arqettes one outburst reacts with any kind of emotion passion or pathos i have had more entertaining experiences getting patdowns from tsa at airport security dont waste your money dont waste your time if you want to see a movie about kids growing up filmed over several years watch the harry potter series at the very least you will be entertainedjust as with other of nolans flicks this is as pretentious and filled with nonsense how can anyone believe that travelling through a black hole will be as simple as walking though a park? even the visuals weret that great just look at some hubble pics for petes sake the story line was weak unbelievable this movie made a mockery out of everything scientific it is scifi at its worst did anyone notice how this movie was a hack of twister? tars collected the data? like how the mini transmitter things were let go in a twister to transmit data? i find it really disturbing so many people think this movie is close to perfect i was shifting in my seat anxiously waiting for the end this piece of bs is not worth the time and money close to 3 hours of my lifei will never get that back thanksjust another piece of hollywood trash if youre under the age of 8 or youre an adult male who reads comic books youll probably like this if youre a normal adult youll probably think its the stupidest movie youve ever seen it has all the depth and seriousness of kung fu panda the plot is nothing more than a rickety vehicle for a bunch of adolescent snarky jokes and inane dialogue the plot climax in which the main character challenges the villain to a dance off practically screams at the audience ha ha ha you stupid idiots we already got your money seriously this movie doesnt even need joel tom servo and crow  it mocks itself this movie is really just beyond bad if youve ever wondered what it would be like if a faraway civilizations looked like bad nickelodeon shows or b a hollywood producer let his 12yearold son write a scifi screenplay youll find this intriguingive never seen so bad movie since indiana jones and the kingdom of the crystal skull how?how can this movie has a rating above 8?? from the beginning of the movie till the end all you see is a mess childish plot childish characters and awful awful humor all the times  even in the serious and important scenes theres always a stupid joke to ruin the momentwhich is already ruined but anyway countless clichs and a story so bad that made me burn many many brain cells the cgi where just ok and the fight scenes were at best indifferentthere were also some slomo scenes with nothing really to offeri mean its like a guy jumping in slow motionseriouslynothing cool about it nothing newnothing about this movie is new or original i have nothing else to say for this moviestay awayive never seen so bad movie since indiana jones and the kingdom of the crystal skull

newnothing about this movie is new or original i have nothing else to say for this moviestay awayive got to admit that guardians of the galaxy caught me by surprise its rare that a movie turns out to be even worse than i imagined it might be you try to sit through movies like this like battlefield earth or buckaroo banzai or total recall the schwarzenegger version i still havent bothered with the reimagined remake or the fifth element or any one of a thousand others and it becomes nothing more or less than self abuse my government knows no shame proclaims ronan in guardians of the galaxy nor apparently does his studio you know your movies in trouble when the one and only character worth watching for even a nanosecond is a cartoon raccoon named rocky rocket who incidentally has the best line in the movie all of them in a big hurry to get from something stupid to nothing at all pathetic thats called a nutshell review by the way this is just plain sloppy storytelling based on one of the leastinteresting comic books ever to see print and antman is next??? what are these people thinking? theres no rhyme or reason to anything theyre doing forget the lack of continuity this is simply hyping cgi sequences that might as well be cut and pasted on a disc unto themselves without the human elementive finally come to see this terrible movie and im still not done shaking my head in disappointment classic tale of pure good and pure evil plus saving the world plus wolf turned into sheep i mean into a beautiful woman burglar with whom the main hero evidently falls in love plus redemption through selfsacrifice plus obliterating all bad guys with a casual ease plus and all these pluses add up to a terribly big minus this is a spy flick even worse and lamer than james bond it is as far from being realistic as it gets virtually nothing that tomcruise does smells like reality watch it if you think that magnificent stunts and burning kerosene and pleasing your twisted need for grandeur are what a good movie is made of the two good things about the movie are the stunts bravely done but absolutely unrealistic for the setting and the soundtrack that is quite decent for these two i give this movie a weak 3 it wasnt worth the timeits outrageously stupid i have read all of the bad reviews currently posted for the kingsman and none of them hit the right mark the movie is violent raunchy campy sexist racist and vulgar and thats all ok but does it have to be so incredibly stupid? honestly does it? and why is the cgi so incredibly terrible last time i checked this is 2015 not 1985 i usually dont care too much for special effects but there is a given level of competence which i expect a film to achieve before it just becomes distracting kingsman has cgi on the level of a cheep syfy channel special feature the acting on the part of the star taron egerton is terrible every time he is on the screen it makes you want to punch him in the face especially every time he opens his mouth same is true about samuel l jackson who played valentine that entire performance felt like samuel l jackson asked him self self how would snl pay this part if they were trying to make fun of me? then he used his fertile imaginations imagined it and played it exactly like that its samuel l jackson acting out a caricature of samuel l jackson playing the role of valentine i think the man seriously is just screwing with us at this point truly a terrible movie not unlike the the league of extraordinary gentlemen only with uk hoodlum playing the main roleits not a science fiction movie  its  um i really dont know how to classify it other than its full of itself ive watched every science fiction showmovie out there and if youre like me you will be mad after watching this movie you can make a movie if your premise is right for science fiction movies and or shows if you explain the science in a believable way even though its not physically possible you have a chance at making a half decent science fiction movie you can use outrageous theories or whatever to show whats happening on film might be possible well winterstellar they dont even bother to do that and if they have some explanation to their science its like they just got some scientific words and strung them together to make a sentence if you like star trekany of them tv spin offs or movies star wars babylon 5 battle star doctor whoold or new and even 2001 space odysseyboring but well made considering when it was made take my advice and stay away you will loose 3hrs of your life the worst part is you wont be able to explain anything about the movie because it simply makes no senseits disgusting tom cruise turned a clever fun ensemble show into yet another big effect vehicle for his mammoth ego i could hardly believe my eyes when in the first few minutes cruise his movie i hold him responsible kills off his entire team which consists by and large of far more talented actors just so he can do his lone wolf vengeance thing this time its personal in those few minutes he destroyed any relationship the movie had to the show its a disgrace ive never liked tom cruise but his astonishingly arrogant appropriation and destruction of the missionimpossible theme is a new low aside from this the movie itself is utterly formulaic uniting the implausible with the predictable jean reno is good in anything but no one can save thisits appalling on every level two dimensional characters shocking acting an utterly fake working class character cynically shoehorned in to broaden the audience demographic an absurd lisp a pure clich_ english gentleman out of central casting and yet another phonedin performance from the reliably awful michael cani havemychequenowplease caine even the violence is tedious its a mark of something truly dreadful when even mark strong looks poor two hours of pure tortureits appalling on every level two dimensional characters shocking acting an

performance from the reliably awful michael cani havemychequenowplease caine even the violence is tedious its a mark of something truly dreadful when even mark strong looks poor two hours of pure tortureits a shame that people are rating this movie so high i registered just to put some sense into imdb i actually dont believe in the ratings of this site anymore possible explanation for a high rating is that people are paid to rate the movie or most people think they are geniuses if they tell their friends that they love a scifi mindblowing movie even though that movie actually doesnt make sense i love nolan but he dropped the ball on this one this has potential but he created a mess out of it a lot of scientific inconsistencies useless characters messy plots one of the most overrated films ever lets bring back some credibility in this siteit would seem the impossible mission is to find as many ways as possible to degrade an original inspired seriesidea first lets get rid of the jim phelps character so that tom cruises ego has no competitors and he can take over the lead spot in any unfortunate spin offs from this mess second lets forget clever story lines and substitute ridiculous unbelievable special effects cruise must have been made of asbestos to survive the train explosion scene brian de palma directed this ? the originalimf force was a team effort lead by the uncorruptible jim phelps and they relied on brains plus meticulous planning to succeed in their missions each member had his part to play in order for the team to survive and they were the good guys saving us from the bad guys this movie will do nothing for de palmas reputation the final result is a disappointment  more so because in places the movie does get it right and it becomes evident what could have been and should have beenit was awful absolutely pointless without any drama that we can expect from this kind of directors nolan tried to make you excited by visual effect and music but these tricks also doesnt work we can clearly see everything comes from market last year gravity made and worked and matthew mcconaughey comes to media because of one successful series and film and today these two come together for more profit or to just save the humanity  its very funny and this film received high points because it cant even entertain you i think generally saving the world idea like this film is bullshit and wasting the time but i diet think that it can be successful jet in box office like this dont waste your time and dont engage in fake worldit starts off with a farmer independence day style and then we are quickly transported into a world where the planet is doomed because well were not really sure why but it involves a lot of wind then nasa gets involved and our heroes get sent into a kind of space that comes complete with bad paintings of old hubble pictures lots of space type language and gravity the gravity is ever present nothing ever floats about and they get skipped off the orbit around mars before whizzing past saturn it has rings and arriving at a black hole they get through the black hole like thats possible by looking slightly concerned and talking like cowboys the robots look and act like corn flake boxes the humans mostly well known look bemused and at that point i had to stop watching i was hoping it was all going to turn out to be a joke but it wasnt i dont like ranting so i wont suffice to say that if the earth has to end at least let it explode before hollywood can make another turkey like this embarrassingly badit started out funny like the previews showed with only a little graphic violence ill give it that then it started getting extremely graphic mass murders heads exploding our whole family of 5 adults were so disturbed we couldnt even talk all the way home we all wish we could unsee it i felt it was a terrible movie even with the few chuckles we got in the earlier parts this movie taught me a lesson i will not be seeing any more movies in the theater without reading every review i can get my hands on this isnt the first time i have been blind sighted by gore and disturbing content if you see this movie i beg you not to take your kids even if they are adults i wish i could go back and not have gone to this one frankly i am disappointed that movie makers feel americans have sunk so low as to find this

us absolutely nowhereit is very difficult to describe how angry i felt after sitting through nearly 2 hours i felt like some smug a**hole who thinks hes smarter than everyone just kicks me in the head spits in my eyes and then call me names i have never felt so insulted by a film but then again i had never bother to watch the star wars prequels the plot is full of holes and the twists and turns are hardly plausible it is true that here are instances good acting can be a saving grace for a bad movie but there is precious little of that in the film the lead characters are unconvincing and tedious bores ben affleck well hes ben affleck sometimes he does decent work but only sometimes the biggest disappointment is rosamund pike i know she is no maryl streep but she is usually not this bad first of all her american accent she talks like she is in some black and white movies from the 50s fine so may be she is channeling some heroine from a hitchcock film but who talks like that anymore okay i am being a nitpicky here my bad her character was supposed to be highly complicated but there was no depth she couldnt even do a halfway decent mimicry of a damaged person its down right pathetic all the supporting characters are awful all except kim dickens she is the saving grace of the film if there is one its wonderful to watch her as the lead investigator of the case of missing wife and the only thing that keeps the movie from flying away like a kite in a wind storm she held on as long as she could all the way until near the end when david fincher ran out of time alas she cannot save this hot stinking pile of garbage somebody please give ms dickens a better position in her career she deserves it the worst one is probably neil patrick harris what happened there doogie? i cannot talk about what is wrong with his character without going into a tirade and spill too much beans so i will stop there doogie stay with comedy please i am glad that not everyone is fooled by this american beautyesque bull doo doo frankly i did not go in with too high an expectation i saw the high rating on imdb but i also heard grumbles that it was not that great the bar i set was in the middle and i still gets crushingly disappointed that is how bad this movie isit is so pathetic that disneys remake was extremely bad unlike the genuine cinderella movie unfortunately disney in its easy copying of the original movie achieved a total failure the weakness of this film if compared to the previous sequels it would simply appear as a clich disney pictures will rely on heavy advertising in order to attract the audience to see it if you are looking for creativity and an interesting movie this film will not cheer you up if you have much money and you got much free time to waste then all you have to do is see this awful movieit is so pathetic that disneys remake was extremely bad unlike the genuine cinderella movie unfortunately disney in its easy copying of

to do is see this awful movieit is so disappointing to see a real classic destroyed by the same people that own the right to preserve it sleeping beauty 1959 stands among all disney films because of its great characters incredible art all the landscapes drawn by eyvind earle are legendary and because disney wisely used tchaikovskys ballet score well maleficent has no personality at all i must admit that jolie fits the role perfectly but sadly her character is so bad developed that it hurts king stefan is such an idiot with no depth at all and that also hurts because in the 1959 film he is a good king fanning does not give any charm to aurora the public does not fall in love with her regarding the art direction well at the beginning the film is a kind of dark crystaltinkerbell movie then it turns into lord of the rings it would have been great that this film would have an original art direction to honor the animated film the story is so rushed aurora sleeps like 15 minutes and the she wakes up to help maleficent kill his father and she gets real happy afterwards it is a shame reallyit is incomprehensible to me that i watched the same movie that the majority of reviewers of this movie on imdb seemed to perhaps i was unknowingly sucked into a blackhole wormhole or plot hole that most of the other reviewers of this movie managed to avoid all i know is that my hardearned money was sucked into this monstrosity along with me and for that i am truly regretful like a few other commenters i had absolutely no feelings or connection with any of the characters even hoping at times that they would all fail in their meaningless endeavors a ridiculous premise with outlandish and unscientific bases very little of this movie makes any sense at all it amazes me that nolan was able to draw the acting talent to this waste of time as their considerable skills are completely wasted on this drivel i should note that on several occasions i actually couldnt help but laugh out loud at the absurdity and that fact was truly telling for me mr nolan et al  you owe me two hours and fortynine minutes of my life backit is beyond me how people can claim the movie to be brainy intelligent well written with all the things i read about the movie prior to seeing it makes it the biggest disappointment ive experienced from cinema in years i give 1 star to bring balance to the current rating in reality this movie is of course not that bad the whole idea behind the plot is that mcconaughey ended up in this blackhole where 5 dimensions were compressed into 3 dimensions and stuff and where he was able to manipulate gravity by sending his daughter the message which was imperative for saving humanity so what in fact happened is through this ridiculously improbable chain of events mcconaughey ended up inside this blackhole all this was apparently the result of a bigger plan all along was there really no easier way for future humansaliens to transmit this data and if they built this timespace warping machine inside the blackhole  means they had access to the data all along? and also means they chose mcconaughey daughter on purpose? so i dont understand what was this purpose? could they not have connected their portal to professors office a long time ago or go for one of the ten billion more rational alternatives? on a side note is it not funny how mcconaughey ignored the message not to go from the same ghost yet followed the rest of the directions? while in the end of the movie he idiotically repeats his feeble attempt had he added its you dad or any other sensible hint he would have saved his daughter years of suffering and maybe a lifetime for himself when he realises this and i dont even want to get into how ridiculous it is that he transmitted data by moving the hands on the watch which was unaffected after being picked up meaning it was hardly gravitational manipulation was it? what was the point of trying to be scientific and trying to explain it in this way then if he could do that he ought to have found a better solution that did not require his daughter 25 years to figure out and anyway they saved humanity by building this massive station named after his daughter by that time they knew what he went through and they still named it after her? why couldnt they have done the same thing on earth? just build the same goddamn station on earth without needing to harvest their gravitational energy bullsh*t bam humanity saved in the same way grand ideas dont make great movies if you cant deliver them properly it is atrocity to compare this to kubricks masterpieceis it just me or this series is just going down the drain every character is getting awfully whiny as each episode is completed if it goes at the same rate this show will probably take the honours of he whiniest show out there when the show started off i thought it was just laurel but it was understood as almost every story out there has to have someone like that to make sure a segment of viewers stay interested but then there was thea even that was agreeable to a certain extent as shes a confused just out of teens kid but then somehow the lead character oliver begins to whine about everything happening in the city is his mistake instead of doing what he was supposed to do  wthinterstellar was yet another over hyped hollywoodized movie 1010 visuals and an ost that sucks you in but the rest was pseudo intellectual bullshit designed to seem deep if youre on drugs or unversed in the sciences of what it actually talks about those with knowledge in string theory other dimensions or who have an intelligence even slightly above average who dont get trapped by hollywood and consumerism would likely agree it sucks i can in all ernest rate that movie a 310 with only the last 20 minutes of that 3 hour movie being evenly slightly worth watching it would get a 110 if the visuals werent incredible and the acting decent the supposed relationships between characters were awful it was slow paced while simultaneously rushing the only 20 minutes that were slightly interesting despite being pseudo intellectual and was all way to predictable minus the attempt to be deep in the last 20 minutes by trying to connect a 5th dimension to the story line and his daughters ghost in her room which was foreseeable the first second he saw her through the bookshelf weirdness that was a waste of time i want my 15$ backinterstellar was supposed to be a cardinal point for mankind at this stage 2014 as far as technological science go and the perspective possibility or not of a new habitat in space it let me so down instead of a true vision for the future interstellar works out an ordinary hollywood blockbuster that vegetates on emotional blackmail in a father daughter relationship sorry christopher nolan but this is not what i payed for why should man go into space if all he cares about is miserable inter human nonsense? the unprofessionalism of the astronauts is limitless austronauts dont go into space without a strict course so not in interstellar in this movie the astronauts choose randomly with course to take this is supposed to be science? dont make laugh what a drivelinterstellar one of the worse films ive seen in a long time 170mins of self indulgent rubbish slow and tedious does not even begin to describe this $160 million piece of nonsense the horrible church organ hans zimmerman music score often drowns out the dialogue so badly that the sound mix must have been done by helen keller terrible special effects that look like they come from a movie made in the 70s a shameless ripoff from 2001 gravity dark star contact to mention just a few awful wideeyed hammy performances from all concerned a terrible nonsensical script with enormous plot holes and hilariously bad science christopher nolan should never be allowed to make another film again i deeply regret those 170 minutes that this monstrosity has taken out of my life unfortunately theres no wormhole that can take me back before i made the unfortunate decision to see this filminterstellar is christopher nolans big bigbudget homage to kubricks 2001 except it is not where 2001 robert zemeckis contact which also cast matthew mcconaughey and alfonso cuarãns gravity used solid science as a launch for deeper philosophical musings interstellar begins with ersatz science and degenerates from there the premise that a planet orbiting a black hole would be a suitable place to relocate earths population after earths environmental collapse is a fatal flaw black holes radiate powerful deadly radiation and everything circling around them are inevitably sucked closer and closer into the black holes crushing gravity somehow the hero cooper gets himself inside the black hole unharmed where he sees myriad display screens of himself at various times in his life and somehow he sends his past self a message the illogic of that circular logic ignores first cause breaks the entire arc of the storyline such as it is then there are illogical subplots like the crew rescues an abandoned astronaut dr mann from death and he repays them by trying to kill all of them for no expressed reason the fight scene between dr mann matt damon and cooper mcconaughey is intercut with something happening back on earth setting fire to a cornfield that doesnt have any apparent connection the sound balance raises sappy music designed to portray emotions like heroism way above the volume of the actors voices the audience cant hear much of what they are saying i thought at first this was a flaw because i assumed that what they were saying would clarify some of the meaningless actions but now i believe that it was just as it was supposed to be gibberish although nolan spent many many millions and some reviewers think this movie rates their highest number of stars i say it is close but not quite the worst movie of all time giving it the title of worst would confer too much attention to this sorry wasteinterstellar is a terrible movie three things one the movie is too long two the beginning is boring three it is stupidi never saw a movie this boring before i dont recommend this movie to anyone it does not get interesting till the very end of the movie if you want to see a good movie this is not the movie for you to watch interstellar got so many people wanting to watch it including myself and it was terrible dont watch this movie it is not good i would rather put a stick in my eye then watch this movie again it is boring i never saw a movie that was this badinsipid tepid vacuous the first 30 minutes are the most pretentious script ever written in the history of film making please somebody burn every copy of this film ever distributed to try to sit through this film to its uninspired and tired read lame ending challenges the endurance okay lets start with the actors ben affleck has not made a good movie ie a movie a viewer might be able to sit through since jay & silent bob strike back who forcedcorralled rosamund pike into making this?? who willingly makes movies with affleck besides jennifer lopez?? really? i was sitting on the couch with my wife for the first 30 minutes of this movie and was forced to hit the pause button an physically leave the room for minutes at a time during the first thirty minutes god help america hollywood acting and moviemakinginception had some problems but its concept stretched the imagination christopher nolans new film delivers exactly what a pessimist would expect if a puffedup batman director thought he could eclipse kubricks 2001 with a puerile adventure story interstellar begins badly and goes steadily downhill as its longwinded prologue introduces the stereotypical elements of a steven spielbergnorman rockwell scifi coproduction  a dying earth a widowed exastronaut farmer his chiseled jaw a feisty daughter a crusty grandpa paranormal activity dust storms baseball cornfields  and lots of corn after about an hour  which seems like two  a valiant crew lifts off in search of a planet to save humanity once theyve journeyed through an intergalactic wormhole the implausibility dimension expands to cosmic heights of absurdity scientific hocuspocus is stirred into the sentimental sludge as gigantic tsunamis deranged astronauts spaceship chases time travel tomfoolery and black hole baloney eventually lead to a schmaltzy hallmarklevel climax the visual effects are above average but far short of awesome when all is said and done the films ludicrous selfimportance and mawkishness leave one rooting for humanitys extinctionin this movie theres cgi in every shot even cinderellas shoes are but cgi hard to believe yet true i can barely watch so much visual boredom lacking real props in the acting i cant see fairy tale type of acting too i would have expected to see the acting being at least as intensive as in the wizard of oz or cinderfella the actors mimics are close to nothing i dont comprehend on why press reports are reporting cate blanchetts performance as overacting gee if anything else than a botoxed face is already declared as overacting these guys should definitively stop gazing at mannequins im a huge fan of kenneth branagh from his shakespeare movies but this time he set the bar too lowin the opening night i walked out from the movie theater totally disappointed to see one of my favorite directors has diminished himself to such a low lever of performance poorly developing plot immature explanation of astrophysics unbelievable and unrelated events and characters especial effects leveled to a disney comedy and horrible music are only parts of my negative impression even mathew mcconaghey did not seem believable looking at her daughter older than himself mat damon probably did his careers worst acting the robot was another annoying part what did anne hathaway and two other guys add to the story? using a laptop to bring down a drown and control an intergalaxy spaceship??? finding a livable planet after passing through the worm hole in another galaxy seemed easier than finding an atm machine in a us interstate highway why would a director hire a blackholeworldexpert as an executive producer to explain a worm hole function by drawing a line on a paper and punch it with a pencil? just reading the worm hole article in wikipedia would give you much more sophisticated knowledge mr nolan looked completely confused in delivering a solid message awareness of climate changes saving human species teaching relativity theory to common movie goers or the power of love each of them bold and superficialimdb 82 rating? seriously? this is basically the worst movie i ever seen i am still very sorry for my 3hourinlife has been wasted a week has been passed and i am still very sorry so i decided to write my very first review here to tell people how bad this movie is if i wanna watch a movie i wanna watch movie with plots with happenings with characters development but not a reallifelike  boring pointless film if i wanna watch a reallife something i rather watch a penguin grow old in 12 years with its family and i am sure it will be more interesting than watching boyhood the boy before aged 8 still adorable but once he is in high school he became a puppet with no facial expression and act like nothing worth him for a laugh this movie is long like i have been spending 12 years in the cinema its like forever i literally clapped when its end as i am too excited and over the moon that the movie is finally over boyhood definitely deserved a best picture best picture to sleep on best picture that deserved the worst picture ever best picture to make you feel regret for your 3hoursin life best picture to exchange puzzled eyes with your friends during the whole movieim very disappointed the script the direction the stiff acting by rebecca hall paul bettany and kate mara ive also seen enough of morgan freeman to last two life times please stop already i wish i had my two hours of watch time back so i wouldnt feel so cheated and used poor johnny depp ive seen this movie in one form or the other from years ago junk it up with cgi computer magic doesnt make the script any better maybe the players would be a bit more believable if i wasnt able to say their lines as they were said on the screen the bad guys wereeveryone in my bookim not a fan of comic book heroes and wasnt even familiar with the character before i noticed the pilot listed on tv im down to only two hours of television per week i cant handle any more than that and thought it might be nice to see something new and it would be nice  if there ever was anything new i made myself sit through the whole pilot which by todays standards equals about 40 minutes of programming and 20 minutes of commercials long before it was over i found myself asking a familiar question does it cost less to produce crap than it does to produce quality remember when the commercials during the superbowl were all funny? maybe some of you arent that old but believe me its true they used to be funny why arent all commercials funny? does it cost less to produce stupid commercials? i wonder tv shows used to be creative technical artistic and dramatic a few of them still are ok maybe two of them still are the rest are crap does it cost less to produce crap? i have to admit that my expectations of any new show arent very high but arrow like so many other shows today fall so far short its laughable lets not talk about the oh come on situations like how does a guy come back from a 5 year absence to a lair set up and running with the latest computer technology waiting for his return think about how much technology has changed in the last 5 years how does the heros friend secure a venue for a party at the last minute that just happens to be right across the street from the bad guys office? and how do people who cant act cant write and cant direct get jobs in tv anyways? is the golden age of television really gone?im going to start off by saying that this is the first movie or show that i have ever reviewed and i have watched a lot of them boyhood seemed like a great concept to me and the trailer looked interesting enough to give it a shot but what really made me go to see it were all of these reviews calling it a masterpiece this may have been one of the worst movies i have ever seen if sitting in a chair and watching absolutely nothing happen for 2 hours and 45 minutes is something that sounds appealing to you then i highly recommend this film i honestly have no idea how someone could even call this a good movie let alone a masterpiece or a once and a lifetime experience im legitimately angry that i watched this movieim always excited to see movies that arent what most people consider your average already done hollywood blockbuster but this was so awful i had to write just how much i disagree with all the praise this movie has gotten the idea of filming a boys transition to manhood over 12 years of actual time sounds like a fantastic idea but im afraid that is really all this movie has going for it we follow the main character through his childhood and teenage years i dont know about you but at least for me those were the most exciting and sometimes heartbreaking times of my life i cant really say why the director didnt want to show any of masons truly pivotal moments or his true emotions he just shows us the truly mundane moments and expects us to be amazed at his originality sorry i wasnt in fact i was quite bored mason mostly sleep walks through the whole movie no real emotion about anything happening in his life sure he cracks a smile now and again nothing like the true rollercoaster that is life the other people in masons life are about uninteresting and one dimensional as he is this movie is a one trick pony that doesnt even do that one trick well critics have praised this to the hilt which convinced me to see it i sometimes disagree with critics but have never felt as opposed to them as i do about this film if you can sit through this absolute snooze fest twice you really should get out moreim a huge fan of the original mission impossible television series on which this was based when it was announced that a movie version would be made i naively got very excited with anticipation of seeing it i read every scrap of information published about the movie before its release however when i saw it i was very disappointed this wasnt mission impossible at all but a tom cruise action vehicle i never bothered to see any of sequels its too bad that a whole generation of movie goers will think that this is mission impossible without ever having seen the brilliant television series it doesnt surprise me that greg morris walked out in the middle of this film and said its an abomination because tom cruise has tainted mis image so badly no one will ever make a television show or motion picture that faithfully captures the essence of mi at least not during mr cruises lifetime or mine thanks a lot tomill try to be as objective as possible here but unlike the premise of this film you wont be able to travel through a wormhole and warn yourself of the impending waste of three hours first im not a scifi fan but rather was a nolan fan so i did want to give this film a chance i dont claim to be a film expert by any stretch but this movie reminded me of a similar experience with the thin red line 1998 in that the entire film was a play on visual that subsequently lacked substance further the visuals in this film were extremely boring its outer space throw in something to look at even if outside of textbook physics with the exception of the black holes its literally black the entire time or a saturn backdrop they also poured in some heavy scores to make an attempt to glamorize the visual effects or lack thereof so earth is dying but they really never get into the whys and hows in an understandable fashion that would help to put into perspective the importance of finding another planet to live on life on earth seems to continue for decades after they start their mission which only exemplifies my point unless einstein himself wrote this script the dialogue in this film is meant to be so overthetop that nobody in the audience is meant to understand it nor question it i had an issue with the character development and lack of justifiable emotion at no point in the film do you really care about any of characters because the storyline goes around like a hulahoop good actors cant make up for their own lack of character development sure cooper cries when leaving his daughter but he is on a spaceship up in outer space before his daughter can grab a tissue to wipe the tears away i think what bothered me most and fits the theme for lack of visual effort were the stupid robots they are basically chrome atm machines with block appendages if i was going to cram a bunch of people and adequate supplies into a spaceship i wouldnt design the robotic assistance to be a huge box that takes up half of the cockpit pure visual lazinessr2d2 was more interesting while being created 30 years ago the more i write and think about this movie the more im reminded of how awful it was this to me was hollywood hyping something up and ripping off movie goers time and moneyill start this with the good points angelina jolie does an absolutely amazing job as the dark fairy maleficent the various acting jobs range from acceptable the three fairies to quite impressive maleficent and aurora in particular also the effects and design are simply gorgeous the magical effects and creatures are wonderful and just look great now the bad i had really hoped disney was above the trend of gritty rebootsremakes but i have been sorely disappointed the draw of maleficent in the classic sleeping beauty was how incredible a villain she was she was just plain evil by turning her into a character who is not only sympathetic but eventually heroic this movie does a great disservice to the character who invoked all the powers of hell to ensure her victory maleficent watches over the young aurora keeping her safe while the three bumbling fairies maintain *complete* uselessness for the sake of comic relief eventually after she and aurora meet face to face maleficent begins to lament her death curse even trying and failing to undo it by the end of the film one is supposed to be rooting for maleficent because the kingdom of humans is corrupt greedy and evil the king completely insane i cannot imagine what executive thought this would be a good idea but it falls prey to gritty reboot syndrome resulting in something that feels more like character named after the ones in that other movie instead of a different interpretation i dont quite mean to say that the movie should have been exactly like sleeping beauty but it just shows no respect for the classic in the first place dont waste your timeill start by saying upfront i was only able to tolerate about 15 minutes of the movie being a primarily marvel comic book reader and tv showcartoon viewer since the mid70s im dont care too much for comic book movies as they are not as interesting as or true to the comic book so yes i started watching with a bias but three successive clichs in the first 15 minutes were immediate strike outs for me 01 the dancing to soundtrack while you work scene 02 perfect fighting and comical acrobatics scene 03 the hey thats my property youre impounding give it back scene never mind the overuse of the charm and whimsy of an cgi space raccoon paired with the comic relief of a cgi walking talking catchphrase spewing tree or the deliberate use of a song hit soundtrack etcyawn i think you get the point imo the best comic book movie thus far is watchmen and i dont even read or care for dc comics and no i never read any guardians of the galaxy comics either the movie would have been better done as a cartoon or all cgiill start by saying upfront i was only able

is watchmen and i dont even read or care for dc comics and no i never read any guardians of the galaxy comics either the movie would have been better done as a cartoon or all cgiill start 1 12 years of wasted time 2 literally nothing happens for 3 hours 3 scumbag stepfathers everywhere 4 the transition from cute kid to an emo kid 5 i only write this cuz imdb requires 10 lines of text 6 12 years of indie rock bands 7 not sure if gay 8 most epic twist in movie history lol jk 9 cant believe its nominated for an oscar 10 best movie to sleep on 11 how to throw away $4000000 12 the boring life of a regular kid 13 unfortunately it didnt get more hd each 20 minutes 14 desperate housewife 15 much feels wow 16 this is why you shouldnt trust imdb ratings 17 shot in 12 years lasts 12 years alsoif you like fairy tales and believe in love then youll hate this film its beautifully filmed and well acted by angelina jolie but the story is so over the top with the male hatred it becomes ludicrous by the end of the film i just started laughing at how insane it was made me think the writer just had to be a woman and she must have suffered the worst break up in history or else she just really hated men i was looking forward to seeing this film ever since it was teased in theaters now i wish i had my money back some may say this film is like frozen thats only if we discovered christoff was actually in league with the evil prince and olaf was their spyif you have technology to build spaceships that go through black holes and technology to make ai machines and robots that look like the monolith from kubriks space odyssey then you dont have to leave earth or any space body since you wouldnt need to any more you just remake the world as you see fit you can stop storms change the weather anyway you like it and grow any kind of food without even planting it you just synthesize all the minerals you need and give them any taste that you would like so the whole idea of this movie is ridiculous and the story itself is so full of plot wholes and just as inception it doesnt make any sense i mean come on some fake scientists writing some fake formulas to solve some fake theorems using some fake scientific methods are you serious? what is this bs???  to tell the truth this movie is nothing but a communist propaganda on a large scale to fool people into believing that life is really way too complicated to make it good for all people are made to think that living in compact spaces in tight spaces in an environment of deprivation is something that is ok and should be taken by people as something normal to fool people into thinking that if they are not going to shrink their living space then they have no chance of surviving they fool people to think that we need to give up life and become just button pressers sitting in small boxes high on fantasy they already have us sitting in our flatsapartments connected to the internet and they feed us a ton of bs every day all day all year and as you see since we have moved in into the cities the bs is getting stronger and stronger with each year and the tighter we are compacted into the cities the level of bs is so high that it just stops making any sense whatsoever have you noticed that all stories now at least the mainstream stories do not make any sense?? everything is so soaked in propaganda that the reality itself is getting destroyed by that propaganda you people should think about it all you who live in small flats and have no life you think about it next time you discuss how great all these movies are you think about how some bs fantasy drama bs moved you how emotional was the experience you think about it and then go back to your tight living space you know what? i dont think you get it the ironyif you ever saw kubricks 2001 then do not waste your time in this movie if you did notthen rent or buy 2001 and avoid this piece of crap interstellar is a dumb and lazy written cash cow disguised as a philosophical statement inception was the same thing but less stupid and more entertaining or at least had more action and violence  do not be fooled by the concept there are just one or two interested statements in this movie but taking three hours for that is excessive the whole things must make sense in nolans depressing mind the world is ending but people is still selfish enough to make matters worse the movie has zero humor and the positive or hopeful message is as fake as the special effects in fact this is a movie about god but nolans refuse to even refer about religion so the movie is about something that is never clear and makes absolutely no sense ***spoiler ahead*** without saying too much about the first ending there is a second happy ending to ensure better box office receipts and is even more absurd  why whoever could create such a device just pass the message and solve the problem ? ***end of spoiler*** mcconaughey is talk is almost incomprehensible anne hathaway is always good but his character is under written jessica chastain has to deal a completely absurd and unbelievable and over dramatized situations and she does not succeed in brief do not commit the same error i made save your money for a better and more sincere money this one is just a scamif you can look past the horrid acting the more than just lacking substance plot and the under developed characters  this series is for you but then again if you watch something based on the leads sixpack somber mood and distant stares then you will love this poorly created series personally i prefer stories of substance a tale with progress characters and a protagonist that has more going for himher than just a pretty face orand chiseled abs it is hard to believe that arrow has survived critics and audiences and has made it to a renewal of a second season its sad to see quality writing ie smash be removed from channels and hogwash such as arrow be allowed to fill the mind of the average intelligent humanif you are a big fan of the television series starring peter graves and martin landau like i am then you will hate this movie as much as i did it has nothing to do with the television series other than its title and opening musical sequence i went in to this movie expecting more if you can get beyond these prejudices then you can expect at best a mediocre movie right off the top of my head i can pick five or six episodes from the series that were actually better than this movie its a shame because i like tom cruse hes better than thisif this is what passes for blockbuster entertainment these days then after 50 years of cinemagoing im opting out for good are the filmmakers of the 21st century so devoid of originality that everything has to be a cut and paste from the past? so a brief run through of the tedium that passes for plot from that most dreaded of all auteurs the writerdirector a dude from the past 1988 gets taken into space subhitchhiker galaxystyle and gets to spout substar wars dialogue in a subspaceballs kinda plot i was looking at my watch after the first half hour there was no irony or intelligence in the story the hero takes off his space helmet in the vacuum of space and hands it over to the sourfaced flatchested star trek reboot and they both survive the director could have at least looked at total recall if the physics were too tough for him if they can censor the best part of zulu for alleged raaacism then i truly hope this garbage gets shredded for stupidity and cynicism a sequel is naturally in the works god bless you stanley kubrickif this had been written and played as a straightout dark comedy  and if it had been at least half an hour shorter  perhaps it would have passed as a run of the mill movie but since it has been presented as a serious mystery it has committed the cardinal sin of filmmaking  that of disrespecting the intelligence andor perspicacity of the audience for us the film represents a significant achievement in that it contains more and larger plot holes than any other movie we have ever seen  and weve seen many this was even worse than babel that said  and a warning that reading further will take you deep into spoiler territory  the following is by no means a comprehensive list of the major holes in the plot so ladies and gentlemen start your engines and drive your semis straight through an impressive array of plot stupidity 1 amy buys a car listed on craigslist for cash so theres no record of the purchase how about title and license? where does she keep the car until she needs it? how does she get to it when she needs it without being seen? 2 amy buys lots of tech toys and crams her sisterinlaws shed with them how does she get into and out of the shed without her sisterinlaw who doesnt like her noticing? 3 the shed is where her husband sometimes has liaisons with another woman they dont notice the accumulating gadgets? 4 the gadgets are bought online who is signing for them? 5 when the gadgets are investigated whose fingerprints will be all over them  if there are any? 6 desi is supposed to have broken into the house beat her bloody and kidnapped her theres blood all over the kitchen but none where she would have been dragged out of the house? 7 as he supposedly leaves the house with an at best barely conscious amy desi picks up her diary takes it to her fatherinlaws place and attempts to burn it in the furnace why? 8 how does desi know where amys fatherinlaw lives? 9 several days elapse from the time of the supposed kidnapping until amy winds up at desis lake house can nobody attest to desis being at home during the time he was supposed to be kidnapping amy? 10 what will be made of the video cameras at the lake house not showing anyone there for the first several days? 11 desi was supposed to be holding her prisoner did nobody at the casino notice them there  including the man who thought she looked familiar? 12 where does amys car wind up? 13 phone records i amy makes the anonymous phone call tipping the police off to the contents of the shed no record of that? 14 amy scores a hole in one at miniature golf and jumps up and down for joy  which causes her money belt to fall off this apparently was an acme money belt on loan from wile e coyote 15 a couple robs amy of all her money being the psycho she is are we to believe that she is going to let them get away with it? 16 phone records ii what is going to be made of amys phone call to desi? sure it was from a pay phone but isnt it going to raise any flags? 17 amy selfinflicts wounds  supposedly in the bathroom out of sight of cameras  to make it seem as though she has been bound and raped yet wouldnt the cameras show her entering the bathroom without wounds and emerging with wounds? 18 amy winds up in the hospital upon her return they put wristbands on her and one guesses they examine her  but they dont bother to wash the blood off of her 19 do they also fail to notice that there is no evidence of the injuries that would have occurred had she lost copious amounts of blood at the initial kidnapping? 20 nick knows that amy tried to set him up for her murder thus opening him up to a possible death sentence he also knows that when her plan blows up she elects to murder someone who has never wronged her other than being male in order to cover up her actions which until that point may have been criminal  but not capital  offenses why does nick elect to live in the same county as this woman let alone in the same house? i could go on but i realized before the movie was halfway over that i had already wasted too much of my life on itif they shortened it down to maybe 1 hour and 45minit would be worth two starsbut they didnt as most hollywood movies with overpaid people who cant actthey stretch it way beyond way beyond what they got storyline i havent read the bookand after watching the movie i dont want to either rosamund pike does a fairly good job of being a manipulative cunning bitchbt could just as easy be replaced and affleck does whatever its he doeslook stupid i call itbut others referred to it as acting theres so many plot holes that i wouldnt know where to begin start with all the stuff he supposedly boughtmost stores have security cam these days should be fairly easy too see if he was the one purchasing the items or notif no one has any objections to the church scene i wonder how they would have reacted when it would rather be a mosque or the greenpeace headquarters this movie shows the exact same thing valentines device did how it could use good music to make you laugh at the most horrible things and think literally it is ok in a way this movie places valentines device right in the theater and shows us our true reactions to horror dished up in the right atmosphere totally acceptable i wonder how we would react because we are aware of the moral wrongness if this music was played and well choreographed in a nazi concentration camp congratulations if you liked the church scene and the scene where the world leaders lost their heads you just experienced the numbing effect the nazi soldiers have felt as they led people to be incinerated full of the music of the f™hreri would normally not comment on a film that i didnt like because it would be universally panned but when i saw how high the ratings are on imdb i was astonished are there that many people who actually do not believe that men went to the moon or that somehow education for the masses is a bad thing? are there people who think that somehow having more farmers means more food production? if the food supply were to be tittering on depletion it would most likely be because education and scientific research had been discouraged long before there was any food crisis this film begins with the absurd and then proceeds to the unbelievable that down home farmer with the rebellious daughter just happens to be the long lost astronaut who is going to save the world its here that the movie switches from social criticism to fairy tale it is just so disheartening that a film so full of misconceptions and false premises appeals to so many peoplei wish i have better things to say about this show unfortunately i have none i wont complain too much about the execution of the badly written scripts i have seen them before and i can stomach that to an extent what made me throw cold water on it is its bad acting stephen amell has the most inexpressive face among the guys ive seen playing the lead role the girls who are mostly present for ornamental reasons thanks to the writers also manage to actively support amell in his able job it left me with a feel of watching a bgrade material they had a promising start with the narrative going back and forth between the time when ollie was marooned and arrow fighting injustice in star city i guess thats all there is to it till the end or up until i watched it the plot didnt spend time in developing any of the other characters the lines were not bad but none of them will ever stick with you if one is looking for action entertaining plot or pretty faces it would pass all sent to be chopped to pieces so some brass could get his medal some politician could get elected and so on thats a strong metaphor for a film and thats why i respect tmc as a honest work of art fc lacks any of that artistic integrity this is just pure crass commercialismi will usually watch any film with johnny depp in it but i wish that i had made this the exception to my rule somehow as soon as this film began i knew i was in trouble call it an intuitive sense based on the number of films ive watched or whatever but the truth is i was correct it is a tremendous waste of exceptional talent in a film that is way beyond preposterous i can deal with expanding what is believable but this film presents it in a way that is incredibly not interesting i found myself not caring within 30 minutes actually to make a scifi film so lacking takes a certain kind of talent its a shame because the genre is screaming for intelligent wellmade movies its also a cruel joke to fill it with so much top talent and then waste it with so poor a script johnny depp could not look more bored and one of his over the top performances might have helped herei will preface this by saying that i have not read the books i did see the first movie and actually enjoyed it i usually watch movies such as this with a skeptic mind and the first one wasnt bad this movie however was terrible heavy spoilers roasting over an open fire to follow ive heard that the movie deviates almost unforgivably from the book if thats the case i cant speak for the book but the movie script looks to have been written by a highschooler at best the movie is riddled with clich_s main character with a dark inner battle raging due to prior decisions made boring people and armies showing up just at the perfect time forgivable once not around the 5th time bad guys who couldnt hit a target 20 feet in front of them while shooting an automatic weapon man those guys suck and the ultimate faked death with poisonparalysis scene wow that whole scene was bad throughout the whole movie the main character the annoying tomboy girl tris keeps being painted as tough and deadly she is neither of these in fact she is quite laughably the opposite could her personal trainers not put her through some weighttraining classes? her hairstylist was definitely present as her hair looked like she just stepped out of a hollywood salon right after the scene where she cut her own hair with a pair of rusty scissors it looks like she couldnt even do 10 push ups yet she was fighting people and saving people falling over ledges with ease but she looks like a huge wuss her little girly grunts and squeals she made when fighting or doing action made me bust out laughing and the scene where she breaks through the glass is meant to be badass and instead just left me hoping she would bounce off the glass and fall flat on her back man i wanted to laugh so bad and probably the most unforgivable part of this whole movie was how pointless everything was examples they fight the factionless on the train killing several and doing serious damage to many more not really sure how because tris fights like a sissy girl then the main character four says his own name and the leader of the vagabonds through bloodied teeth is like oh we cool bro never mind you just headbutted me in the face and killed my friends the hell?? oh and triss brother is a huge pussy they continue to fight hard and kill people to narrowly escape the perfectly uniformed drone guards of the capital so that they can go in to hiding then the main character just gives herself up i think it was because the villain was threatening to kill innocent people with her mind control devices never seen that before but it doesnt really matter then shes given the chance to escape by her double double crossing friend didnt see that coming and yet she chooses to stay to open the mystery divergent box well what was the point of anything if you wanted to open it anyway?? i was dying to contain my frustration also how does the evil capital lady have this perfectly built divergentboxopening proprietary chamber system complete with bulletproof glass and mysterybox holding pedestal just already set up? does no one question this stuff??? and to top it all off the supersecret mustbepreservedatall costs message in the box the entire point of the movie divergents are cool dont ostracize them oh and the rest of humanity is living outside the wall cheers what? no one has bothered to check this whole time?????? gag enough roasting to conclude lots of movies even good ones have clich_s and information that you are just supposed to assume but this movie was genuinely terrible maybe all the people reviewing this with an 710+ saw a different movie than i didi will give this movie a 1 for visual effects only 1 because the director put the emphasis on these but stole ideas from avatar and man of steel  the flight looks cool doesnt it? other than that the movie is sending confusing messages to the ignorant people of our times who dont know that maleficent means one who does evil so  in anyones opinion  how can an entity that looks like a devil fairies dont have devilish horns and dark colored wings with ugly horns on them and is called one who does evil named from birth not after she suffers the deception how can such a person be presented as kind? honestly?? its something new from disney  to have a voiceover say in such a gentle voice hello dear stupid audience  heres our dear devil that we want you to love she looks ugly but try to love her love her horns love her ugliness love her evil name love her companion whos also named like a devil this is the new kind of love that were telling you its the real thing its in tune with the youths love for vampires werewolves and ghost stories that so many have fallen in nowadaysi went to watch this movie expecting it might be a decent scifi movie but it turned out to be yet another terrible crap here are the few reasons why i found it crap 1 if a guy fell in a typhoon a usual earth disaster it is most probable he will die but mr coop is made of some different material the guy went inside a black hole where matter collapse beyond nuclear and quark level but he comes out in one piece with all his consciousness intact this very presentation by nolan just cheapened the depiction of a black hole 2 so top notch team was sent out by nasa yet they cry and whine about so small issues like oh i want to see my daughter back even at my company of 16 people we act more professionally seriously people buy whatever crap is fed to them in the name of nolani went to this movie expecting an incredible masterpiece as advertised on a saturday afternoon there were about 25 people there i was so very disappointed this movie went on and on and on so much so that i continued to look at my watch wondering when this movie would end would it ever end?? and then it kept going while the idea of filming over a 12 year time frame is unique and very clever the film just needs major editing its the story of a boy growing up there was abuse which was painful to watch but basically the film was just too slow paced and boring it goes on for almost 3 hours so take a meal with you if you decide to go despite these alerts it is just slow long and boring i seriously considered just getting up and leaving and asking for my money back i wasnt sure if everyone was in the same pain i was but i also considered standing up and yelling when will this film ever end?i went to this film and all i can say is it was the longest technical demonstration of bullshit i have ever seen im having a hard time writing about this film because i honestly wish i could forget about the film the film has its strong points and those are visually appealing cinematography and an impressive use of sound the negatives of this movie are however to many to put in a single review the film has an alright beginning and the build up of the characters is done pretty well and you get to see matthew mcconaughey do some wonderful acting however none of the characters were developed enough for you to care for them however the movie jumped around so much from plot to plot that your emotions got shocked when very predictably a character gets killed but then the story moves right along with a nice action scene thrown in to keep you awake the movie is full of quantum physics jargon that no one could possibly follow the jargon is about an hour of the movie and i have a fairly basic grasp on physics having taken a few college physics courses but i can say for a fact that many of the things might be true out of context but in the frame of the movie didnt make any sense im not writing anymore in this review i just recommend you go see another film it felt like a waste of a good night to me but judging by the reactions of all the people in my theater you will probably find it a confusing a deep trip into breath taking quantum physics induced acid tripi went to see this last night with my wife in a screening and we both thought it was total tripe it was a brainless movie with terrible acting story and script even the special effects were done badly the story was absolutely rubbish and it was also far too violent the violence in this movie is so extreme it will make many people uncomfortable  i normally have no issues with violence in movies however this was totally and unnecessarily excessive there was also sadly the usual braindead racial stereotyping propaganda and ignorance in the movie as has become the norm for hollywood movies and some of the acting was so bad it was beyond laughable i have never seen acting as bad as samuel l jacksons acting in this movie and i also have no idea why people like michael caine agreed to be in this rubbish this film has been totally overrated by the media and has had ridiculous blanket advertising in most uk cinemas its sad to see this kind of rubbish getting so much financial backing and being forced on people  there are so many good movies which get no advertising or support this is seriously one to avoidi went out of the movie theater with mixed feelings i love scifi i would have like to travel to other planets not anymore i wanted to like the movie so much that my brain forgot most of the bad side of it first i said to people that interstellar was only for scifi freaks that it was not a feel good movie pretty damn dark and depressing but it was overall a good movie but my love of scifi had block all judgment after talking to other people who saw it my view of the film change radically here are why  1 have you seen stupidest robots than in interstellar 2 the pilot farmer daughter saw gps coordinates in dust yeah right and they goes to those coordinates and find nasa bunker they are abducted by the nasa and the nasa chiefs tells the farmer  you are the one we were waiting to pilot the spaceship that will save humanity even tough the nasa didnt sent the dusty coordinates wtf 3 the extra beinggodor human of the future had placed for humans a wormhole near saturn why so far? 4 they went to a sea planet to rescuesee those sent before that is a sea planet with no ground to plant foodanimals not a good choice and they couldnt see the giant waves from space? 5 they went to a ice planet to rescuesee those sent beforeice planet without animalsplantswhats the point so close to a black hole that a few hours on the planet = 23 years to the spaceship in orbit is that a good choice to try to establish a colony on a ice planet near a black hole? 6 the spaceship is relatively small we could see the 2 shuttles and the ring that create the gravity inside the ship there is the machine to create babies 10010000 ? fertilized human eggswithout ? the incubators if you find a planet yes to the babies but the spaceship so small that the foodbaby milk would be out quite soon 7 have you seen so bad cryogenic bed? a kind of trash bag that wrap you up 8 nobodys really knows whats inside a black hole but nolans view is ridiculous add that the the farmer go out of it and survive to find is old wrecked house inside a giant spaceshipi went into this movie with decent hopes given the high rating it had but its not like i was over expecting or anything in the end i found this thing a total a mess i think for me it tried to ride too many lines and as a result failed in most aspects it tried to take itself serious as a spy movie yet it also tried to be this weird comedy and while i think movies are capable of doing both this one just didnt do it well or right to the point where it just bounced me out of the movie completely far as it taking itself seriously i found it to be way over the top unbelievable and unrealistic to the point of being stupid far as the comedy i just didnt think the nuclear head explosions or the mcdonalds being served on a silver platter was funny at all granted im american and i get that english humor is a bit different but i love monty python snatch mr bean even most of the bond films yet most of the funny moments in this movie i just found remarkably unfunny to the point where rather than it being a quick laugh it just completely bounced me out of the movie and the few comical moments that were actually funny were already covered in the trailers so for me this movie totally fell flat on the comedy scale to the point of actually hurting the movie now on the taking itself seriously aspect the whole spy gig the young recruit it just failed on that level for me as well certain aspects of the action scenes were done well and some of the bullet time action was good but i thought the editing needed a lot of work the massacre in the church i just thought was way over done and too long i find it amazing in movies like this how fight scenes go on for many minutes and when its all done people are barely winded breathing normally give me a break go watch professional boxers or mma fighters and see how they look after just one round and they are real athletes who train vigorously so while some of the action was okay it was so over the top that again it bounced me out of the movie so between the bad comedy and overcooked action i was constantly being reminded that i was watching a movie rather than be swept up into one my last beef is with the main kid and the whole recruitment  training camp probably what bounced me out of the movie the most was here we have some reckless rebellious kid whos training to this point has been gymnastics so okay hes flexible has good balance etc yet with little to no further training at all hes the biggest bad ass? the recruitment  initiation program was a joke it wasnt a training program of any kind it was basically lets throw these kids in a no win situation and see how the fend and who comes out on top i get the idea was they were trying to weed through all the recruits to get the best one but the whole while i kept thinking so this kid is just a natural born bad ass because he did gymnastics and has daddy issues? then once hes out and starts real life spy work hes untouchable and better than all the worlds master assassins its like her moms bf who bullies him early in the movie who he confronts in the end and im thinking so other than being this super spy what has he done to actually improve his skills as a fighter? overall i thought the action was decent but very over the edge of what youd consider to be believable movie believability i mean the black comedy was pretty flat and did very little in making me laugh or enjoy myself finally the believability of this kid taking over for his dad and his quasi predecessor was just absurd i give it a 3  10 one point on principle and because i liked the main spy girl a 2nd point because some of the action was decent and a 3rd point for the best part of the movie which was the bare ass scene at the end which shocked me enough to yell out helloi went into this movie thinking it would be a nice movie from disney since i had heard it was a darker adaptation from the classic sleeping beauty from the perspective of the villain and i still think its a great idea and still expect to see the same thing with other classics even if in this case the idea was very poorly executed starting with the director it was a risky bet by disney because robert stromberg had never directed a movie his work is almost exclusively visual effects and it didnt pay off even though he did a good job adapting from the original story there were some parts where the story and some actions from the characters didnt make sense at all then the acting was also sad bad acting from the three fairies lesley manville imelda staunton juno temple and from all the male characters especially sharlto copley angelina jolie did a good job not her best of course but a solid acting the idea of maleficient was to tell the story of sleeping beauty from the perspective of maleficient but it didnt even give depth to the character there are holes on the story and that hurts it pretty bad the images and effects were also very average and not good enough for 2014 overall the movie wasnt appealing at all and the story acting and effects were weak however i applaud the idea and hope disney learns from this movies mistakes and do more of these kind of movies but much betteri went in with low expectations but nothing can prepare you for such a dreadfully uninspiring convoluted ass numbing experience matthew mcconaughey is totally miscasthardly audible at timesterrible southern droll there is so much crying in this film he cries his daughter cries the scientist cries the insert villain cries this film treats dangerous black holes like an elevator journeytheir dangerous magnitude and awe is lost and ignored in a few short scenes the colour pallet for this film is washed out greys dull and lifeless the 2 planets they visit are so badly realised and uninteresting you can hear several astronomers and physicists weeping in their homes and hanging up their lab coats christopher nolan is on a mission to devolve the human race with total nonsense its just awful another space film ruined by a weird crazy space odyssey endingto be honest the film lost me long before that the robot is terriblelike something clunked together from lego by a 4 year old every scene with it in made the audience cringe or laugh 165 million dollar film with some of the worst effects ive seen on the big screen in years the camera angles were baffling especially following the shuttles in and out of orbit they were filmed so closeit was like the director knew they were st and said its ok guysill pan to a member of the crew crying i didnt care about any of the charactersnolan is just awful at conveying human relationships awful script writer with his brothernepotism at its finest im still recoveringshockedim done with nolanthe dark knight rises was awful inception was awfulthis is just the icing on the cakethis should have been a space exploration film wowing the hard paying audience with its gripping story and dazzling effectsin the end its just total toshlifeless boring and self indulgenti watched this painfully boring movie to the end  all 2+ hours of it everything in the film rang false i am not as erudite as some of the negative reviewers here but they are not lying i hate movies that try to press the same fake emotional buttons over and over again parental guilt love duty heroism blah blah blah this movie does it at every turn until you cant stop groaning the suspension of disbelief what every work of fiction aims to achieve once that stops working youre in trouble no you cant drive a truck at top speed with a flat tire through a cornfield without losing control no corn is not harvested by a combine and left lying on the ground when it is green then there were a lot of scientific facts that were ignored or glossed over about space travel im not a scientist but there were many times when i said wait what that doesnt sound right anyway i think i reached the minimum number of characters so i can stop do not pay to see this movie enough saidi was very much disappointed by this flat action movie and its predictable ending i am a fan of the old missionimpossible series of the 60s and 80s and therefore i think the plot is ridiculous at best why should jim phelps do what he did? he was always loyal through the many episodes of the series and there he could have gotten much more money if he had betrayed his team the reason why peter graves jim phelps did not star in this movie is because he did not agree with what i have just said anyway this movie is not for fans of the series because there is nothing left of the teamwork spirit of the series it is a one man show for tom cruisei was very disappointed with this film i cannot understand why anyone would complain about the complexity of the plot compared to an average episode of the tv show the story was simple meaning that one action follows the other and nothing really unexpected happens in other words it is very constructed and you can sense it for example the way in the terminal room is much too easy i think in a tv episode the writer would have invented much more tricks the thing that might make the film hard to understand may be the way how the simple story is told in addition to that some scenes are so illogical that they are already silly for example the helicopter in the tunnel not to mention the often criticized fact of making an arch villain out of jim or the stereotypic dialogues i will not spend a cent for watching part 2i was very disappointed after seeing this movie especially after having read so many positive reviews the portrayal of physics and astronomy here is so pseudoscientific and so preposterous that i found myself constantly sighing or scratching my head all throughout the movie i dont have a degree in astronomy or any other science field for that matter but the scientific freedoms that this movie takes are so incredibly blatant and obvious that even i found myself bothered by them even for a scifi its far too liberal in this regard but thats not the only problem with this movie the characters are paperthin and the way events unfold is often irrational or portrayed in a very contrived manner for example an ex nasa pilot stumbles upon a secret nasa base which he found by interpreting strange dust formations into binary code which he then somehow immediately knew were map coordinates  makes so much sense huh? where he is immediately offered to pilot their only rocket which is to save mankind and is to launch the following day because all their pilots are inexperienced and have only flown in simulators whereas the protagonist has flown before many years back and only barely leaving the atmosphere but thats fine theyre sure he can manage an intergalactic journey involving many years of travel deepspace hibernation traveling through a wormhole and finding a new world to save mankind no need for any training or a medical check of course surely hell be just fine he just needs to show up tomorrow for the launch incredibly when our hero performs the greatest feat of space exploration ever  traveling through a wormhole he and his crewmates just play it cool the feat is given no more significance than a casual stroll through a park there are quite a few other examples too where the plot is painfully contrived and makes the whole movie difficult to take with even a bit of seriousness another thing that completely broke the immersion was the very unscientific language that was used all throughput the movie a movie that was supposed to be about space exploration and science youd have to be mentally challenged to actually believe that this insultingly simplistic chitchat resembles anything close to actual scientific language that high level nasa scientists professors and engineers would use this is nothing short of an insult to our intelligence ill end by saying i really fail to comprehend how people claim this to be the best scifi movie ever it seems to me that were stooping lower and lower in our expectations of what makes a film great its almost a standard now to expect a movie to be bad when reviews are surprisingly positivei was so utterly disgusted with one scene that it compelled me to write this review my first oneever okay so to begin with i thoroughly enjoyed the film prior to the last 20 mins it was highly entertaining humorous in bits and the lead actor did an amazing job i did feel however that due to the amount of foul language and over the top violence in one particular scene at a church that it lost one point this movie wouldve made it on my top rated list so youre probably wondering what was so terrible that it completely ruined the movie for me so let me tell you now bear in mind that i am a woman in my mid 30s and not conservative by all means but there is a scene in the movie where eggsy the main character is propositioned by an imprisoned princess what is so wrong with that you ask? nothinghad she not offered her ahole in exchange for him saving the world why? it completely took me off guard and cheapened the entire film it was completely unnecessary and utterly distasteful such a shame because it was such a great film tooi was really excited from seeing the review score on here and all the hype i had heard from other people via social media i eagerly pressed play the initial opening scene was quite intense and moving and i was quite taken aback by how that went i wondered if this level of intensity would set the bar for character development throughout the film and i was immediately grasped my illusions were soon dashed as the film fast forwards to when the boy is grown up and is stealing an item he is most definitely not grown up and a complete idiot i guess this bit is meant to appeal to 6 yr olds? it is almost as bad as trump jokes i cringed i let it slide and hoped for better it got exciting when the chase scene was happening then they went to prison then they broke out and then they tried to sell the item that pretty much summarises the whole film the main protagonist is a buffoon who swears a few times for good measure kids watch this film the only character that seemed to develop was draxx as he reflects on his poor choices the bad guy isnt even scary  he doesnt do that much compare the bad guy to loki and the difference is infinite no character development apart from a 1 minute scene with draxx the annoying rocket character that had zero impact a non entity villain a weak weak weak plot line and the dialogue was so flimsy in fact most of the characters flip flopped around in reasons to do things that didnt really make logical sense the only saving graces were the planet scenery and make up i hesitate to say the cinematography as it was cgi the worst bit out of many was where the racoon decided he wanted a mans prosthetic limb to escape the prison and then sniggered about how he wanted to see the guy hop about  i actually found this really offensive and dont want my children to think that is a funny and b ok the best bit was the soundtrack overall a very disappointing disjointed film it felt as jarring as star trek into darkness coupled with star wars jar jar binks and a smidge of the goonies but nowhere near as goodi was looking forward to seeing this film but the points i would give it is nothing out of 10 everything about it is remarkable in its awfulness writing acting absolutely unconvincing and you knew what they were going to say before they said it i hope that is not the american way of life because its unreal the word they use throughout the film is awesome and whenever even the tiniest thing like batting a baseball ended up with the high five i would have been better off weeding the gardens and growing swede it would have given me a great deal more pleasure it is a film i wouldnt say is a turkey but a massive pork pie with plenty of jelly even that sounds quite nice i am always thoughtful about films i love films and the film that leaves the memory lingering is jet boy a remarkable canadian film i would give that 8510 if anybody wants to waste their time in totality get this film for £10 remember you have been warned i put the film straight in the firei was genuinely excited to hear that disney was going to make a film about maleficent my favorite disney villain of all time i was interested in knowing the why behind her actions in sleeping beauty since we never really got to see that i will say that the cinematography is amazing i will also say that while angelina jolie was not my first choice she had the look her costume was spoton and there are moments where you can see where she is at least trying to play this role correctly and really who could replace eleanor audley? but one thing ive noticed over the past 1015 years is that animation and design seem to be their main focus rather than story or character development in the movie maleficents back story was incredibly rushed so much for going into depth on why maleficent is the way she is this movie does not explain why maleficent is the way she is disney is showing us a completely different character while giving her the same name as disneys most iconic villain now theyre trying to say that maleficent is a misunderstood character who becomes evil but that never happens she becomes angry and bitter but not evil maleficent in this movie is not even a misunderstood sympathetic character she is a total victim who never becomes evil at all oh she does do one evil thing she does still curse king stefans baby out of revenge and she has second thoughts about it two seconds afterward see? not evil at all and while im at it i should mention my distaste for the way she cursed aurora disney completely lowered the stakes by having maleficent utter the words sleeplike death and be the one to offer the cure of true loves kiss no its merryweather that counters the death curse in order to save auroras life oh maleficent may say later that she doesnt believe true love exists but thats a matter of opinion isnt it? again lowers the stakes and what was linda woolverton thinking when she took king stefan and the three fairies completely out of character and gives them a complete 180 in order to make maleficent look good? if youre going to show us the point of view of a famous villain its okay to give them layers and gray areas in order to make them more interesting and multi dimensional even to show they werent always evil but not to say they were never evil at all that just completely defeats the point of the character same with the good guys they may have their own flaws show that they have their own prejudices or that everything they did wasnt perfect but not to say the good guys were really evil or stupid the fairies flora fauna and merryweather i refuse to call them by their new names are nothing like they were in sleeping beauty and this is a big deal in sleeping beauty say what you will about their flaws but their ultimate motivation was keeping aurora safe at least they tried even if they failed maleficent 2014 portrays them as nothing more than stupid buffoons who only care about saving their own skins aurora was just a means to an end for them they have no relationship with her like they do in the original the movie also took away their own personalities so they are no different from each other i cant even keep track of which fairy has which name watching them on screen with everything they say or do was as cringe worthy as i expected it to be king stefan has to be one of worst written villains i have seen in a while he has no real motivation for what he does we see him as having nothing in the beginning and then the movie glosses over his relationship with maleficent in order to get to the good part where he steals her wings in order to be king after that he wages war on maleficent for cursing his daughter and yet he only looks at aurora as afterthought property why is he even after maleficent then? what else has she done to him other than cursing his daughter? elle fanning as aurora was very impressive i do think she gave the character more of a personality that was lacking in the original and she stole the film in every scene she was in unfortunately that wasnt enough to save the movie nor were maleficents interactions with diaval as enjoyable as they were and of course maleficent does not turn into a dragon in this movie i have to ask why disney? you knew how loved of a villain maleficent is and her being a dragon is one of the many reasons why also we live in an age where technology and special effects are abundant you didnt use the opportunity to see how your most iconic villain looks as a dragon when done with liveaction cgi? why would you waste a perfectly good opportunity like that? besides the fact that maleficent is not evil in this film she also is very wimpy and pathetic she cant do anything when we see her fight an army at the beginning all she does is fly around and slap a few soldiers with her wings the tree monsters did most of her fighting for her in sleeping beauty she could transport herself to another place in a matter of seconds she could shoot lightning from her staff and she could transform into another form other than her own she didnt do any of that in this movie just like with alice in wonderland disney wasted a perfectly good opportunity to effectively adapt their animated work to the liveaction screen maleficent may not be the absolute worst movie ive seen but its definitely in my bottom list nowi was extremely excited to see this movie when it came out boy what a waste of excitement angelina jolie was terrible i swear she only had about 30 lines in the whole movie most of her scenes were of her posing in her costume and looking or trying to look evil stick with the original sleeping beauty movie if you want a movie with an actual plot whoever made this movie focused on what it looked like and the cgi more then the actual acting which was horrendous the whole movie was just eye candyabsolutely no depth to it whatsoever no more angelina jolie movies the woman cant act at all all of these big blockbuster overhyped movies have no depth or plot its like they put all of their energy and money into the visual appeal of the movie and said to hell with it when it came to the actual acting and plot such a shamei was expecting a lot more from this weak and slightly laughable movie johnny depp is literally sleep walking he has all the presence of a cardboard cut out and seems like he just doesnt care depp plays dr will caster a genius who takes technology all the way by working out how to upload a human consciousness into a quantum computer well lots of them a terrorist attack sees the doctor poisoned with weeks to live so his wife evelyn rebecca hall and best friend max waters paul bettany do the unthinkable they upload him this idea is not new there have been other films with a similar idea and also a twilight zone episode the character of joseph tagger morgan freeman could have been played by anyone as the character had no substance what so ever and freeman was predictable and unchallenged there is a ghost town that ends up home to the doctors mega lab locals made invincible and joined like the borg on star trek the entire government is represented by one man the army by a few more the terrorist wind up working with the good guys to stop the doctor never mind that they where the ones who killed the doctor in the first place well his body anyway its silly and it ends badly but not too soon for mei was anticipating this movie as i was an ardent fan of the original series and the remakes in the 80s what a major disappointment this was the film begins ok but then it all falls apart and becomes just another run of the mill action movie using the same format that hollywood churns out so often cruse is totally misscast and unconvincingthe point of the series was its cleverness and the fact that you could not work out how they would do things this was just the biggest disappointment on film i have seen apart from the even worse 2 follow ups i am sure many younger movie goers would like this film simply as an action film but mission impossible it is not and jim phelps turning traitor? pleasei was actually intrigued by this movie a spy movie with action and comedy i love those types of movies the beginning started out good i actually liked this movie until all the killing dont get me wrong im not one of those antikilling people movie type person my problem with this movie is that the killing distracted me from the story the story lol especially the fireworks scene in the movie yes the special effects were cool in all but come on fireworks? when youre gonna kill a bunch of people you turn it into a fireworks show that part completely ruined it for me onto the story i got the basic plot of the story but once again the killing kept distracting me away from the story in conclusion the movie had a lot of potential but did not live up to my expectations i do have the admit cinematography was actually pretty decent compared to the rest of the filmi waited with great anticipation for this movie and was sorely and truly disappointed i dont understand where the 10 reviews came from? what planet were they on perhaps they were from viewers from the other side of the worm hole or black hole i have been a sci fi fan for many years but this movie took a leave from all logical or good sci fi explanations plot was ambiguous storyline convoluted technology was not linear one sees a 20th century saturn v lifting the crew up to a 22nd century space craft sleep pods with crew jumping into them like they are going for a nap exploratory craft that operate like a star wars movie landing on a water world with some silly time dilation theme that doesnt affect craft in orbit? cant these people survey the world from orbit? black holes 5 dimensions with metaphysical connection shameless referrals to 2001 it was embarrassing on and on for way too long han zimmers music score was good with a few good special effects but that was iti vote 110because its awful to compare other marvel movies hulk is good  iron man 123 are great captain america 12 and avengers are awesome thor 12 and this are bad at logic unreasonable for adult if this movie is for 012 kidsand not marvel presents i will not say anything and wont recommend any friends to see it in my impressionmarvel is a very good movie maker and always surprised me but this and thor 12there are very serious logical problems to make you feel vulgar there are tons of good movie on imdb top listfor kids if you think this is marvel presents watch this just waste your time and money i am very doubt it how to get 80+ point on imdbi vote 110because its awful to compare other marvel movies hulk is good  iron man 123 are great captain america 12 and avengers are awesome thor 12 and this are

presents watch this just waste your time and money i am very doubt it how to get 80+ point on imdbi usually love slow burning character driven movies where the plot moves at a pace that dictates character development and depth then i realised that there was still over 1 hour to goand nothing had happenedand nothing looks like it will happen and i dont care what happens just make it stop so i didi stopped watching now i am relieved because moments agoi turned into peter finch and began raving im mad as hell and im not going to take this anymore im mad as hell and im not going to take this anymore im mad as hell and im not going to take this anymore what is the point of this dribble mascaraing as a movie i dont care what happens to the boy the mom the sister or that dad i am not wasting one more precious second on this meaningless reality fantasy pretending to be interesting or clever or arty i hated this i usually dont write these reviews but i am so antiinspired and this way would like to warn people if you dont like first 10 mins everything later will be even worse i thought that skyline is worst movie ever but after watching this one i am really not sure the plot doesnt lead anywhere almost all characters have horrible personalities they are absolutely stupid and not capable to to lead their lives scenes are lasting too long and for many i find no reason of including them to the movie the movie lasts too long and it is so frustrating and irritating that after watching it you realised it was total waste of time just dont make the same mistakei used to watch the 80s series remake of mission impossible and feel this movie is largely mission impossible in title only its really just a big star vehicle and moneymaking enterprise for tom cruise sure its an entertaining mindless romp that will keep your brain happily in neutral for a few hours and that may be all youre after the revelation of who is the true villain will anger some fans such as myself it really wasnt anything like the 80s mission impossible i remember what about the comraderie between characters? what about the team effort thing? these things are missing because its tom cruise vs the rest of the world the best thing about the film is larry mullen jnr and adam clayton from u2 being on the soundtracki understand the appeal of superheroaction comic stories the good guys are purely good and noble and selfsacrificing and easy to pick out because theyre really good looking and wed like to think of ourselves as those things or potentially those things if we could just get around to putting down the doritos and remote and having a meaningful job and life the bad guys are just as easy to pick out though many of them are good looking too in this version of the ofttold tale at some point though we grow up and all this comic book ethos is revealed to be a ridiculous and childish take on a complex human world where no one is purely good and few are purely evil but its still appealing to some level of us thats still stuck in our childhood moral upbringing where ma and pop told us about right and wrong and we still wish it were that simple and clear and that bullies got their comeuppance some people never grow up and see this sort of thing for what it iswishful simplistic thinking others know what it is but find it appealing anyway for the part of me that is such a person a couple stars for doing a decent job of it in this show this show is also full of extremely good looking people any heterosexual female is going to dampen herer palms watching this the action scenes are unevensome pretty good and interesting and some fakey and in violation of the laws of physics the presentday plots are utterly predictable the resolutions simpleminded as is the romance the backstory scenes were interesting in the first few episodes but paled quickly as of this writing the show has gotten repetitive already minus three stars for immediate fake negative votes of the first version of this review in case the shows makers paid for those which is a sleazy practice i watched all the shows said to be the best of the fall 2012 season for at least two eps each and this is indeed one of the better ones but its not actually goodi truly believe that all these giant user reviews with 10 stars are just paid to review it this movie is a massive disappointment seeing it again will not change anything its just down right boring it is over hyped to no end do not waste your time and money seeing this in the theater this movie has a rating up near the shawshank redemption it does not even come close to being that good of a movie when the shawshank redemption is on tv you dont turn it off no one does because that is an example of a great movie if i never hear about this movie again that is all that will salvage it in my mind some of the visuals were nice but that is about it they werent great it was few and far between and honestly i dont know how you can even try to bank on the visuals because it was basically like any other space movie there was nothing that set it apart in my mind i couldnt even consider being impressed by any aspect of this movie it should be put on a shelf and forgotten christopher nolan should go back to making batman moviesi thought the film was totally awful bad script bad acting bad music and especially bad taste it pretends to mock james bond but with no style whatsoever they are using young people to tell a story that has no moral and is totally unrealistic it seems like a celebration of violence with countless bloody scenes that make you sick they are not offering any interesting points of view but telling a cheap story through violence sexism and clichs including a blond princess i dont see why anyone would want to watch this film and i dont recommend it to anyone i also feel pretty bad about the cast who have supported such a bad film even worst on them they should have never accepted this filmi

have supported such a bad film even worst on them they should have never accepted this filmi thought it would only be fair giving this 1 star even though its maybe  at best  a 4 because this is definitely not worth 8 guardians of the galaxy was a shot i chose to try in god knows how long since ive been to the cinema this is just another load of hollywood trash i had the impression it was innovative considering the guardians being pulled out from the bottom of the pile and the whole outlaw thing but i was wrong in the beginning whatshisname is on earth and it is apparently 88 the kids mother dies ok is this meant to be emotional despite the fact i have no attachment to any of these characters yet? oh wow its the future now im sorry his mother dies he goes outside and then he gets abducted? what is this supposed to signify? not to mention its obviously unbelievably and strangely timed but this is probably an attempt at giving some depth to the main character but really doesnt do anything for the major plot of the entire film the rest of the film was just a bunch of underdogs coming together because they end up in the same space prison because what happens when youre arrested together is you share a block not to mention gender is no issue here then they fall into this orb situation what is it? it it is this orb and it is powerful a bit like the cube or something there was little development in the story at all really a few changes in direction but no real twists or anything surprising i dont even know i was almost asleep half the time i was constantly checking my watch to see when it was over so we have hideous cgi here ridiculously unprofessional but i guess im not in with the cgi in blockbusters they have this obnoxious claim to fame with technology it seems having the ability to do these things doesnt make it cool it just looks like a video game another thing visually was the designs it was just so typical of the actionscifi genre in the technology and whatnot and the characters very much in the same boat but moreso thrown together effortlessly then after that its all explosions  speeding  advertising  hitting in between theres a conceited amount of one liners that made me cringe the best kind and in the end we have some false suspense because we know everything is going to be okay overall >the comedy was horrid >the story was simple >the characters were lacking in everything really the cinematography didnt even involve cameras >the soundtrack was a bunch of pop classics chucked together so what was good about it? the action1111 wait no >the action was too much unnecessary and clearly there to fill in time main reason i even saw this was i received an invitation from some mates i think ill try go back to sticking to films with a point the only point of this was to brainwash and make big bucksi thought it was a complete waste of time to go to the cinema to watch this movie where to start? the plot is ridiculous the script is simple and not genuine the characters are weak and afflecks acting is terrible it seems like they try too hard to make the impression the story is complex but this worsens it even more in general this movie makes you feel nothingis not believable and i really dont know how can someone launch a movie like this and not feel any shame i respect this director very much but this work is not at all close to what he has done before i have to say it is one of the worst movies i have ever seeni think back to this movie and have no feeling for italthough i remember all of the scenesthere is no emotion or empathy that i feelit was three hours of watching nothingnessin my opinion i could have been watching my or my friends life storiesbut ours are probably more exciting than this ludicrous film it was apparently filmed over twelve years why? they could have hired different actors as time went by and made this movie in a few monthsi dont see it as artistic or unique in any waya young boy grows uplike all of us in different ways there are various issuesdivorced parentsbeing bullied in high schooletc so what? i compare this film to a fascinating british series called the seven up series a small group of british childrenaged sevenfrom various backgrounds and classes were interviewed every seven yearsuntil aged fifty sixthey were followednot all of them continued to participate later on but most of them didit was amazing to see what had happened to them in comparison to what their initial thoughts were when they were seven years oldi loved that seriesit was cleverinterestingunique and i couldnt wait to see what had happened to these kidsin boyhoodby comparisoni couldnt care at all what happens to masonhis sisterhis mom played by patricia arquette or his dadethan hawki was left with an empty feeling why did i waste three hours watching this boring film which masquerades as art? pleasedont let it win best picture at the golden globes oroscar awards i will be completely turned off hollywood movies dont waste your money on this drivelwatch it for free when its on tv if you are really curiousi saw the trailer expecting this to be an extraordinary movie angelina jolies looks is perfect for the part the effects promised to be nothing short of awesome and the glimpse at the dragon woke up delightful memories of fear from the day i saw the original cartoon movie with my mom a long time ago i bought the tickets to see it in 3d with my daughters and i could anticipate the atmosphere of malevolence from the dark maleficent then it all changed in the name of doing something different and to surprise the audience the screenplay writers threw a wonderfully balanced story out the window and decided to make a nonsensical parody instead who do they think they are? to second guess writers that have thrilled whole generations of people and produce this garbage in the name of the box office? not only did they alter the essence of the story but they made a total confusion out of the message of good versus evil what? bad is good and good is bad? or is it good sometimes and bad in others? what will the kids think? do the screenplay writers really expect that the kids will readily understand how despair and betrayal can turn someone into a vengeful person? does it even have a place in this story? of course not kids may need to be taught reality in real life but when they are told a story taking place in an imaginary world they expect something straightforward so that a message stands clearly out the only good thing that can come out of this is that someone somewhere makes a remix of this movie the way it should be done filling the blanks with the original cartoon masterpiece shame on you disney studios watch snow white and the hunter and learn how a classic story should be told and especially how far it can be altered without losing its essencei saw the trailer and the science of interstellar on youtube and i felt compelled to watch the movie oh boy the movie was such a disappointment there no respect for science in interstellar the movie is a waste of time and money it was without logic and too long i dont understand how such an awful movie can have 910 stars its beyond my comprehension the music is to loud and for nothing there is no real tension after reading the 1010 reviews i felt compelled to register an account on imdb to say how awful the movie was stay way please or youll regret it from now on i will never rely on imdb reviews when it comes to decide what to watch imdb you disappointed mei saw the rating of 83 at the imdb and wanted to watch the movie the movie started well but then it moved into the same lame side of the universethe movie brings nothing new to us it was like watching avengers againor any other superhero movie where the superheroes fight with each other at the beginning but then unite to fight a common enemy the movie was packed with inappropriate and lame humour the acting was below average marvels should really consider the type of movies that they r making i am still shocked that how on earth that this movie got an 83 ratings this surely effects the credibility of imdbi saw all the positive reviews for maleficent so i went to watch it in the cinemas with high hopes i wish i had ignored the reviews maybe i went in with too great an expectation but ive marked and graded 8th grade creative writing papers with more substance and plot when you can call the conflict and resolution as soon as it is being set up you know more thought was put into the cgi than actual story development and the casting oh god the only person who was logically cast was jolie dont even get me started on the child actors there were many times where i turned and looked at everyone else watching to see if they were reacting positively to what was on screen i found a couple breaking out the cards and playing a game of bluff the ending quote and fade to black was met with a what the f was that? by the audience and a bunch of laughing and booing if you require more than pretty colours to entertain you save your money and time for any other film maleficent gets a star for its beautiful cgi work and costume design but falls flat in every other respecti remember seeing this movie in the theater after that i saw it at least once on vhs maybe twice i picked up the bluray of this used from a blockbuster that was closing ive been more interested in seeing spyaction movies recently and it seemed like something i should revisit i wish i hadnt bought it there are so many problems with this movie nearly all of which have to do with the script first i dont care about anyone on the team cruise doesnt come across as having a personality and he doesnt behave like a skilled agent everyone else in the cast seems to be disposable second the plot had potential to be an interesting story provided that the story was treated a little more like the ateam with them trying to prove their innocence instead we wind up with a story where we arent positive why cruise is doing anything except for some vague idea and it comes across confusing because its hard to draw a line between his actions and his goal third because of the first two i find myself having no sense of tension or investment in the outcome of the movie i couldnt care less if cruise lives or dies the movie hasnt aged well the pacing is strange and once again computers are relegated to be magic boxes and the action sequences seem to be silly when cruise leaps from the exploding fish tank i couldnt keep from laughing the big finish fight with the train and the helicopter was not up to the same level of silliness but it was very very close now i have to figure out what to do with this bluray copy that i really will never look at againi rely on imdb when it comes to decide what to watch and what not to watch rating of 92 looks so attractive that i didnt even bother to check the trailer i went to watch the movie with very high expectations but was very disappointed as i was watching it i was thinking maybe know it will start to make sense but it didnt even by the last scene it was a total bollywood drama where hero doesnt die no matter where he is the most funny part was when he press the eject button in space it does has some big star cast but the base story line crumbles beyond imagination it was like monkeys had written the script as they has shown in south park awful movie total waste of time and money please go if you hate yourself or your life which is one and the same thingi really wanted to like this film i was looking forward to watching it after reading the rave reviews and seeing the trailer now having seen it what an awful movie _ although the film starts out promisingly enough except for the heartstringstugging opening in the hospital it rapidly becomes the same old shoot em up that you have seen innumerable times the special effects are good but the fightbattle scenes are too frenetic to be able to follow the action clearly i also found the plot torturous and difficult to follow due to the proliferation of double crosses unclear explanation of who the bad guys are and then the bad guys behind the bad guys confusion with all the different places empires etc and their interrelationships some of the dialogue was execrable with chris pratt talking like a dude from 2014 ironic considering he was abducted by aliens decades agoi really wanted to like this film i was looking forward to watching it after reading the rave reviews

like this movie and while it does have a few positive points on the whole it was stunningly underwhelming dont waste your money on this stinkeroo parents note this is not the movie you want to take your children to see it is one of the most graphically violent movies i can ever remember seeing comic decapitations are still decapitations there is also a scene where a mother tries to murder her innocent toddler with a large ax one of the characters is literally cut in half from top to bottom and then shown in graphic detail awkwardly stapled back together a large part of these problems can be directly related to inept direction director matthew vaughn has no ability to reign in the more hammish actors samuel l jackson pulls out all the stops  and basically ruins every scene he is in jacksons performance has to be the worst of his long career it may well be one of the worst performances of the decade his character was just stupid and incredibly offensive to so many people on so many different levels he chose to speak with a cartoonish lisp which might suggest he is effeminate or perhaps that he has a speech impediment  motivation is not an issue here  dont look for logic or rationality anywhere in this awkward movie fans of colin firth jack davenport mark hamill and michael caine will be very very disturbed by how these characters are treated on a positive note taron egerton is a delight he has enough skills to overcome the horrible direction and ham handed performancesi really like the series with peter grave 171 episodes between 1966 and 1973 and 35 episodes between 1988 and 1990 who shows jim phelps and his team saving the good against the bad and make of the character of jim phelps a traitor was too much for me it was simply disrespectful for all person who knows the 2 series it was better to kill the character in mission than make him an traitor now if i forget the series my vote will be an 6 the train under the channel was really too much an helicopter behind a train in a tunnel the explosion of this helicopter who only punch tom cruise back on the train the rest of the movie was better i like the scene with the explosion of the aquarium sorry for my english but my mothertongue is frenchi really like nolan and like all of its films until i saw interstellar the movie has its moments but in between those moments there is lot of time waste this is one movie that i really wanted to see but in between the movie i was thinking when is this going to get over i think nolan could not decide between making a scifi movie and an emotional movie he has given an average movie and because its a nolan movie i have given it a 1star i know it doesnt really deserve 1star but then i am angry with imdb there is no way it should be rated 9 i think lately imdb has become a hub where marketing people raise the rating through any means available disappointed in nolan and imdb too i really dont see how everyone is giving such great reviews of this movie its one giant plot hole from which no stars can escape say what you like about nolans film making style but this movie should have never been made throughout the overly long self indulgent piece of crap i said many times that this movie had better end really well of course its just one notch above the worst ending i can think of for it i think they killed all the consultants off before they started filming too just save yourselves run dont watch iti really cant enjoy a clich_ like this one and i dont understand how people can get behind an awful childish movie like guardians of the galaxy cheap jokes and laughs seen that done that scenes bad guys and visual effects i didnt care much for any of the characters in the movie and the powerful connection between the members of the team had to be the most important part of it nobody was funny there werent any cool jokes and creative and visually stunning scenes it was just another scifi ripoff from the major productions in the genre huge disappointment dont watch it 85??? people are weird not the moviei really cant enjoy a clich like this one and i dont understand how people can get behind an awful

movies above 8 should be a must see ones and this one fails big time in the must see list if you are for a mindless action movie with some bond lines from the 80s yes this is something that you will enjoy if however you want to see something enjoyable with nice humor and an actual interesting plot then please dont watch this one youll definitely waste your time what you get here is something that you know the end in the first 5 minutes i mean come on the struggle to be accepted in the high society and the movies about it was a hit 30 years ago if you have money or you are a clever person then you will be welcomed everywhere in the world also the jokes are flat and you have to be 15 years old to actually laugh all in all you get a lousy plot with lousy lines and a soso action with some cgi effects thanks but no thanksi read some opinions from different users before watching the movie and even got excited about the idea of paying my entrance for guardians of the galaxy but was absolutely disappointed because what i found was once again as many major blockbusters do a weak plot and lots of action scenes without an strong story behind and when a movie lacks an story it feels like an amount of nonsense battles and a compendium of action heroes against bad guys i really like the characters of the film but the quality of a movie cannot rely on the strenght of undeveloped characters star wars is still ligth years ahead from these guardians sorry waste of money and timei never write reviews about movies but having seen the ratings on this site i have to say something to stop people from being misled about this so called blockbuster the movie is total rubbish and made no sense the acting is dreadful and watching it after an hour made me wish everyone died so i could end my pain 3 hours of my life that i will never get back do not waste your time watching this movie and if you do just remember i warned you first ps i have also noticed that all the 1010 reviews are from many non english speaking countries and just i wonder if they have all been paid to boost the ratings of this publicity driven awful movie stay cleari must say that i really didnt like this film all that much though since i had seen the first i felt that maybe i should go and see the second one though i am having second thoughts as to whether i will go and see any more basically the film follows on from the first film where the divergents have fled the city and are now hiding out with one of the factions that lives out in the country however this what were it was a little confusing at the end of the first film i thought they have fled behind the wall however it turns out that they hadnt but instead were hiding out in one of the rural areas secondly i though much of the city had been rebuilt and from what i can remember of the first film chicago was nowhere near as ruined as it was in this film basically the villain comes across this box hidden in one of the ruins and realises that she must find a divergent to be able to open it so she sends out her guards namely the members of dauntless who remained loyal to her to track them all down as it turns out trix is the one divergent that is able to open the box however the problem is that she is in hiding as are all the other divergents however that is all i really feel that i can say about this film i thought it was boring the acting was pretty ordinary and i ended up sitting in my seat for the two hours that the film went for quite uncomfortable and waiting for it to end it seemed that i enjoyed the first film and obviously there will be a conclusion but a part of me simply wants to read the wikipedia entry for the book so i dont have to spend anytime sitting around the cinema watching it when i could be doing something else i hope they dont go and do what they did with the hunger games and split the final book into two movies but we will see when they get around to releasing iti must echo the sentiments of many of the other negative reviewers the movie moved into emotional elements of the characters without developing the characters i felt nothing for the characters and i really wanted to there were a few moments when i was interested enough to see how the makers were going to present some of the physics based elements but nobodynothing got spaghettafied neil degrasse tysons descriptionterm it is really a love story disguised as a scifi fantasy and not even a very good love story i was so bored i fell asleep for about 15 minutes i felt like just getting up and leaving so many times but i thought maybe if i stayed it would get better it didnt i really hoped that the actors starring in the movie could make it better they tried but it didnt help can i get my money back? how many millions of people could they have fed for the money they wasted making this movie? they could make it up to me if they donated the money they made from this movie to feed the poor in this countryi may drop a few spoilers here so be warned i find it very hard to understand why so many people thought this movie was so good yes there was a good cast yes the special effects were good in this day and age that is expected but the story? teaching that space travel to the moon was a hoax? whats that about? the farmer just happens to be a trained astronaut? his daughter just happens to be a mathematical genius? the lies that are told and this intelligent astronaut is so gullible? the denigration of education as if that is any positive way to save mankind? the striving by the government to have more farmers when it has been obvious since the industrial revolution that larger mechanized farms utilizing fewer farmers are more productive the belief that new colonies can be created by bringing embryos to life? who thought this up? the same people who strive for an uneducated populace? and amid all this somehow commuter space travel is developed? too much bull for me to swallow really folks?????i may be too harsh giving guardians of the galaxy such a poor rating but i have to be honest this movie is garbage i suspect that the people who give it such high praises are nothing but marvel fanboys gotg is boring really really boring the movie tries to be funny but falls flat with one bad joke after another rocket raccoon who is obviously supposed to be the funniest character since he is the most sarcastic and has the most oneliners is painfully unfunny anyway i laughed a little bit at the beginning the rest of the time i stared blankly at the screen periodically glancing at my watch the action sequences only contributed to the boringness of the movie why? theres no risk to the main characters it is obvious that they wont be killed the danger is never convincing enough to raise the pulse guardians of the galaxy is a bad moviei love scifi thrillers and all i hated this one there is something fundamentally wrong with this movie the story reads as an excuse an excuse to keep you in a room and play some space flight scenes the film tried so much that ended up failing in everything i think the problem is the blend of emotional crap with bandaid surrealistic physics that makes no sense just so that emotion could be the focus of this crap movie i would really like to convey my opinion but this movie only left 2 brain cells properly working it is that bad i sincerely hope i make it i have been drooling ever since i left the cinemai love scifi and so hoped that this movie would be great given the reviews but it is literally one of the worst movies i have ever seen do not waste your time or money there are no emotional or intellectual catalysts behind this worse than b movie film who gives a damn about such stupid undeveloped characters? i am groot this is the best line of the film and groot a living tree is the best character enough said? if you like stupid campy scifi films smoke some dope and maybe youll like this one if you want to listen to 1970s pop music get a cassette tape such a disappointment wasted 2 hours of my lifei love marvel whether it be xmen thor the avengers spiderman iron man most of the commonly known ones of course but i always loved them but to put this as simply as i can though that doesnt mean this will be short this film was filled with 1000 of the most common clichs extracted from these great films and stories and crammed them into one mashedup jumpy unreserved ridiculous abnormal spiteful detestable idiotic moronic absurd ludicrous senseless meaningless pointless terriblywritten unbelievably unrealistic supersupersuperherowannabe movie that very desperately and obviously and obnoxiously attempts to specialeffect everything and i mean everything to simply gain some big bucks because hey its marvel what could go wrong? its sad to see how successful their attempts were i fell for it for me its all due to the avengers because that was freaking amazing even though it had a lot of commonplace stuff and boy do i regret wasting my two hours on this extremely disappointing collage basically its a film made of collages because everything just had to be colorful in outer space no seriously of course everything is colorful there its not like the galaxy is filled with 96% dark matter that is called dark for a reason so yeah totally makes sense and your skin also starts rotting in outerspace too serious case of leprosy then? i liked elektra more than this id rather have watched that five times kind of feel like that says something the only reasons i smiled or laughed was because the directors and script writers were decent at making corny jokes puns and lines funny enough that giggling is impossible prevent unless you are emotionless they should have gone with comedy rather than actionadventure though since i sincerely thought the rest of the moments were just junk call me a spoilsport if you must but i was literally whispering what would happen in the next minute to my friend beside me usually im not very good at predicting what happens in films unless they are seriously full of clichswhich this film is but i said them anyway i was right 8 times out of 9 i counted anyway though the beautiful graphics did rival that of avatar the plot of saving the people from the evil mastermind only this time it involves the whole galaxy instead of just one planet so its not just earth thats being targeted this time so ha we are different never got this tiring i was so close to sinking in my chair and dreaming up a nightmare because of how stupidly predictable this film was maybe that was intentional and marvel fans just wanted to see some new more unique heroes this time and also to see the visuals and maybe to see chris pratt and zoe saldanas pretty buttsbut whatever i had half that mind prepared for a clichturned awesome movie when i walked in the theater i came out with my whole mind filling up and overloading with shame and displeasure so plot would have been old and good but it wasnt protagonists i would have cared for them more if the filmmakers didnt blow up almost everyones favorite guy and kept alive some peoples leastliked guys so yeah villains  oh my gosh no seriously? what even happened to the evil robot woman? did the filmmakers just completely forget her? music louder than inceptions horn and i loved that even though it had no tune couldnt stand this though but still be ready for some rocking 80s and 90s music that i would have downloaded if they didnt play those songs during totally inappropriate moments comedy relief my butt the only relief i got out of the soundtrack that isnt even their soundtrack hopefully they didnt violate any copy rights i mean if its these filmmakers i wouldnt be surprised is that im glad groot enjoyed himself visuals stunning that wasnt sarcastic at all at all what else? oh yeah unless you pay me a million dollars i would never watch the sequel so sorry i cant contribute ten dollars for marvel next time tough luck dont let this review stop you though most of my friends liked it and of course most people who reviewed this movie liked it so i guess im just a jerk im betting you readers agree and thats totally understandable since i am totally venting but hey three out of four of my friends never watched a marvel movie so call me bluffing but i sincerely experienced one of the deepest disappointments i have ever dealt with in regards to a movie franchise in my entire life  im still going to watch xmen though dang you marveli love marvel whether it be xmen thor the

friends never watched a marvel movie so call me bluffing but i sincerely experienced one of the deepest disappointments i have ever dealt with in regards to a movie franchise in my entire life  im still going to watch xmen though dang you marveli love good superhero films captain america superman iron man this is not one of them if id been alone i would have walked out and the last time i did that in a cinema was for the wedding singer its not without merit but with $170 million spent i would hope not the design overall is very good the effects also and unlike some i liked chris pratt and the ronan actor but the attempted humour in the dialog is supremely irritating and the racoon characters grating voice was enough on its own to make me hate the talking scenes the film is so derivative it could have been assembled by cut and paste but at least it does not take itself seriously we are thankful for small mercies enough said i will go out of my way to avoid james gunn films in futurei love dramatic movies i love scifi movies i love most of christopher nolans work i was so excited to see interstellar after all the 1010 reviews but after seeing it i was thoroughly disappointed my actual rating is probably 610 i rated 110 to balance the other ratings spoilers ahead here are my major problems with this movie 1over dramatized effects throughout 2every character except for 3 of them was just a redshirt with no characterization just created to be killed off 3the science aspect was stupid especially in the second half 4did this highly developed 5d race have any way to save humans besides creating a room that a guy would go to to tell himself to go there so that he could send binary through a watch to his daughter that is older than he is? 5the ending was a thorough disappointment everything was happy dandy and the whole human race was saved just because of data from a black hole? they never explain why that data is even useful 6poorly designed and explained apocalypse earth didnt seem to be in much peril 7okay when mann blew the airlock couldnt the others just tell him that it would blow up half the ship instead of saying dont do it its not the right decision 8really? the voice of corruption is called mann? that was a stupid metaphor 9i dont think there was even enough water on millers planet to make waves those big seeing as it wasnt even knee deep 10just wasnt what it was cracked up to be the film was heavily lacking in character development and plot the science aspect was unbelievable and stupid parts that i liked no it didnt all suck 1tarz was pretty cool he was unique compared to all other robots from scifi movies ive seen 2the highly dramatized parts would have been good in moderation and there were some good special effects 3i didnt fall asleep which is good i just cant believe so many people are raving over this movie its like theyre too dumb to see past special effects and blaring music to see that the movie itself wasnt any good people try to tell me the science in this movie couldve made sense because its not discovered yet i think a planet with alien dinosaurs who speak english would have been more believable its worth seeing so you can realize how wrong everyone is but dont expect too muchi looked forward to seeing this film so i was excited today i watched it it started badly i couldnt understand what the characters were mumbling later on i found this a god send it awful a real mess  badly made most of the time i had no idea what was going on too many characters introduced so quickly six different locations in ten minutes i hate itill never watch it again i only watched it to see if would improve but no it got worseif the comic was like this well its no wonder i have never heard of them beforethe tiny bits of humor are the only things that made em pay attention to anythingi wouldnt recommend this to anybodyi just recently watched the series from beginning to the present episodes such promise the show has slowly deteriorated into a scifi soap opera to oliver thea is not really your sister shes your half sister from a man your mother had an affair with whom she now hates or hated because she is now dead or is she? that man is dead now or was dead and is now training your half sister to be a killer why did she stop hating him? oh and the love of her life roy is being replaced by a dj olivers main concern is bedding every female in the cast while those around him slowly find out who he really is the whole show reminds me of the heroes series because it seems that week to week they dont know where the story is going so they change things at the drop of a hat and hope people go along with iti just finished watching this movie and have to say what the heck is wrong with hollywood? do they not have writers that any frigging common sense how hard is it to make a movie that is logical engaging and doesnt insult your intelligence you could try and suspend rational thought and just try to watch it for entertainment but thats impossible to do in this movie because there is no suspense no serious action frankly its pretty boring the premise completely defies logic first there is no way the government would not have been all over the notsosecret unguarded facility really depp was supposed to be a super intelligence why would he set up in an unguarded section in the us? depp is supposed to be in the internet with access to any file but he couldnt find out about the governmentterrorist plot? the script screws itself up depp rewrote his code so it was totally unbelievable that a virus could have been created in a few minutes stupid the whole premise of the movie was stupid technology is bad and any advancements must be destroyed this concept was so stupid depp  s character was curing people the environment there was nothing evil about what he was doing the writing was terrible the reason the terrorists wanted to destroy depp  s creation is stupid it makes no sense there was no build up of depp  s character going from good to evil the lawn mower man did a way better job of showing how the characters went from nice to homicidal maniac it was just plain stupid to set the premise that depp had become the smartest super computer but he acted like he had the iq of a 2 year old dont waste your time on this unintelligent moviei just an advanced screening of this movie and felt i had to write about it i expected so much from this director wally pfister and cast and i just feel so let down it seems this movie is meant to be a pure scifi with a great message at its heart but it just wasnt good points it has a great cast it looks great good cinematography the cgi was a good standard but not mind blowing bad points major plot holesits also very dull i can usually take the mrs into a scifi movie and although she wont enjoy it on the same level i would she would be able to sit through it good thing i watched it on my own as she would not be able to stomach this in fact i was seriously bored there are no sub plots there are no twists and turns in fact not much happened ********* this part of the review contains major spoilers ***************** there is no real explanation of how they upload the mind of the main scientist  other than some reference to a monkey brain that another scientist managed to achieve then there is the whole building of an entire datacentre  the one the size of a small city underground by a contractor who seems to only have experience in building cafes and houses why does the government not notice that an entire town has been taken over? once the nanites are everywhere why not just infect the whole world? why does the ai not just suicide itself instead of allowing itself to be infected? then there is the idea that max writes a virus to destroy the ai that was created  exactly how does this man out wit the greatest intelligence in the history of the world? how does max infect evelyn? just because max works in ai how does that mean he could write this amazing virus into a human being? ok maybe i am a little biased i have a degree in computer science and i work as full time software developer so maybe i know a bit too much but still **** end of spoilers ****** the entire movie felt flat on its face it invoked no emotion whatsoever there was no wow moment there was no edge of your seat thriller it was a dull scifi movie with a big budget and a great cast i love scifi and thrillers and i am a huge chris nolan fan so i had high hopes for this also please mr pfister go back to doing cinematography with chris nolani heard a lot of squealing about this movie and expected better but its very conventional and follows the same ol story arc as movies it is supposedly mocking the characters are a tad snide and make a few quips but other than that this movie is extremely middleofthe road the only lead character with any screen presence was the big wrestler guy as for the lead if that dude walked by me on the street i totally would not recognize him no star power here no screen presence zoe saldana is starting to get typecast as space babe she should take another kind of role soon bradley coopers character was downright annoying an angry little animated character is not new or groundbreaking we dont even get a dynamic bad guy people everyone knows that if you want your movie to be kickass you have to make your bad guy dynamic weirdly sexyor at the very least british this is known as the alan rickman principle this bad guy was just some weird blue dude who apparently drooled a lot while eating black licorice and forgot to wipe his mouth off this movie is a giant hohumi have seen birdemic birdemic 2 the room sharknado and etcetera but none of them come remotely close to this terrible film the aforementioned are at least comical in their terribleness boyhood is neither funny nor inspiring or anything positive for that matter halfway through the film i felt myself wishing that ellar coltrane had died in a tragic car accident or something of the sort just to prevent this film from ever being produced the concept for the film is splendid and one of a kind unfortunately nothing else was remotely interesting please save yourself 3 hours and do something else eat some dirt lick a bee smack your arm with a sledgehammer repeatedly for 2 and a half hours to give yourself half an hour to spare anything and i mean anything is better than this filmi have not read the book but will now just in the hope of finding something that justifies the hype around this story the film was like a farce which to me verged on the comical with the cartoonesque type characters another reviewer comments that had this been billed as a dark comedy it might have just cut the mustard and with that i agree but a tense psychological thriller? no way it was not cleverly written there were plot holes galore the diary really bugged meeven after slight burning i think they could have told that it had been recently writtenand the whole of amys escape story was just utter hogwash the acting was abysmal with the exception of carrie coon margowho presented the only sympathetic and remotely realistic character in the whole thing not my cup of tea at alli have no idea where are all these amazing reviews are coming from i fell from them and watched the first episode which is totally crap its a poorly made soap  with long stares and bad acting the characters are fake and the plot is a total rip off my best guess is that the writers of these reviews are the actors their family and friends who are posting fake reviews do not watch this show  i want my wasted time back i have no idea where are all these amazing reviews are coming from i fell from them and watched the first episode which is totally crap its a poorly made soap  with long stares and bad acting the characters are fake and the plot is a total rip off my best guess is that the writers of these reviews are the actors their family and friends who are posting fake reviews do not watch this show  i want my wasted time backi have never wrote a review in my life ever but i feel compelled to do so for this film im utterly shocked just shocked this movie has an 84 rating what on earth are people thinking? seriously? i could go on and on about how the plot is a complete joke but ill just point out the most obvious of all that totally shatters any believably that this film ever had okay amy said desi came to her house and kidnapped her that morning huh? she had no clue what he was really doing that morning none what if he had a meeting with ten other people that could account for him not being at her house? what if he was having breakfast with someone that morning? ok next now how about the diary? so did desi kidnap her then grab the diary and bring it to a house he had no clue even existed and burn only about 20% of it? next when she pretends to be screaming with blood on her dress against the window so the surveillance cameras would see her seriously? what about all the other footage those cameras captured? for example her and desi sitting together on a couch watching tv oh she deleted that footage? well what the hell is her explanation for all the footage being erased except the 20 seconds of her screaming this is not me nitpicking the film and looking super hard to try and find problems i get it a lot of movies have plot holes here and there and im okay with that but people these are huuuuge holes in the story plot holes are in tons of movies all the time but not usually a major motion picture with a major director and a major movie star and please dont tell me shes nuts and thats why she didnt cover her tracks worth a damn i am talking about the fact that she gets away with it to all the law enforcement this belongs on lifetime those movies you can just shrug off what baffles me and actually really upsets me is the fact it has a rating of 84 so please people help me understand this what on earth gives this such a high rating? what were people thinking? what?i have actually watched just about all of the show that has been released i am not writing my review after watching ten minutes of the pilot and deciding its crap i really kind of liked the idea behind this show i heard some people complaining about the lack of realism but come on its a superhero show a little unrealism ought to be allowed upon watching the first few episodes i kinda hoped that like lots of great television shows the actors and writers just needed a bit of time to get into their groove really find their characters once that occurred i reasoned the quality of the show would start to pick up so despite my initial reservations i kept watching and waiting and waiting and waiting it just never happened the plot has remained unimaginative static and predictable the actors are wooden and unsympathetic and the writing is overall just a train wreck i could honestly predict exactly what the actors were going to say next it pains me to see this truly mediocreatbest show get the rating it has received i will attribute this injustice to the fact that the actors are incredibly pretty and the assumption that those giving this show a good rating would have their brains explode upon watching some quality programmingi hated this movie its not just a truly horrible film its so incredibly ultra violent its like the video game grand theft auto with zombies only worse this was the most disgusting type of violence gratuitous and glorified truly over the top the trailer for this movie is 100 % misleading it makes it look like a james bond movie in reality its more like a zombie movie horrible horrible horrible i wish i could unbuy this movie ticket i wish i could unsee this movie its truly the worst movie ive ever seen absolutely disgusting i gave this movie 1 star but if i could i would give it a minus 10 i feel sick to my stomach most definitelyi hated the movie because the end is creepy and weird that she kisses her on the bed while shes dead and then she wakes because it was true love kiss makes me think that she wants to say that there is no true love at all between women and men and that true love only lies between women and women that is kind of gay and pathetic and sick i am very disappointed in the movie  maybe the next movie for disney would be about a love story between two lesbians hows that ? prince phillip used to be my favorite disney prince but here i guess hes just another tool used by feminists to shove their message down our throatsi had my doubts before but now i am sure if it disney has sold out recently disney has been releasing films that whether the public chooses to acknowledge it or not have been paintbynumbers at best films like the lone ranger thor the dark world and frozen yes frozen its the same disney crap youve seen over and over people dont get me wrong i love disney but not this disney one that would butcher one of its own beloved fairy tales to make a quick buck yes you heard right disney did stoop that low i should have known that this film would be garbage from the getgo when they hired alice in wonderland writer melissa woolverton to pen the screenplay and alice in wonderland production designer robert stromberg to direct are you sensing a pattern here? lets touch on that for a moment the mouse house in its infinite wisdom got a production designervfx supervisor who had never directed anything to direct their $200 million blockbuster as a result maleficents beautiful visuals carry no weight and the actors for the most part seem utterly lost because what the hell would a set designer know about directing actors? even angelina jolie cant pull off her real emotional scenes because she is left to direct herself what really sank this movie for me was disney blatantly ripping themselves off and using the true love twist from frozen literally the exact same twist i have no problem with disney creating a strong independent heroine but if youre going to do that dont have your heroine wear a skintight leather black cat suit in the climax of your movie in short disney has definitely lost its magic and its going to be tough to get it back dont listen to the positive reviews remember how glowing alice in wonderlands were when it first came out? you have been warnedi had high hopes for this film i am sorry to say interstellar was the worst film i have seen in a long time i have seen many terrible films but none have compelled me to ever write a review of what i thought there is too many things that make this film and i am not going to rant along here i just wanted to say if i could rate this film 01 out of 10 i would plot holes complete disregard for science bad acting better special effects and spacecraft motion physics have been seen in thunderbird puppets storyline has no clue where it is going and many more i would put this film in childrens fantasy category rather than science fictioni had heard quite a bit for mission impossible especially now that the third one is about to come out in the theaters i knew my parents owned the first mission impossible but due to the crazy antics tom cruise has pulled on well basically everyone he has pretty much turned me off of his movies but i figured to give the mission impossible movies a shot while over all this is an exciting actionspy flicks there were only a few scenes in the movie i felt were worth the watch obviously the exciting scene of tom coming through the ceiling on wires and copying the information onto disk the last action sequence of the helicopter and train with ethan and our surprise villain very well thought out unrealistic but exciting to watch over all for movies sake give mission impossible a chance but its nothing i would scream or jump on couches about  410i got something out of this movie i really did it was 35 degrees celsius outside the cinema and all i needed was a three hour nap in cool airconditioning lucky me the latest nolan film just there for the taking it started off as i hoped it would all dusty on the porch of some ranch in the middle of the us otherwise known as nowhere the end of the world syrupy americanstyle little kid tugging at the heart strings  my eyelids already beginning to droop even before coop and his daughter murph wind up at some place that some old cockney and his very jewish daughter inhabit guess it only happens in movies with a blind casting director but that was fine i was almost in rem sleep  not having been able to process a word of dialogue from mcconaughey in over 20 minutes pure bliss and it got even better from an insomniacs point of view thanks to an absurd plot and woefully unimaginative cgi effects my chin was almost on my chest when they landed on the first planet the other side of well lets just call it credulity i dont sleep this well at home wait were going through another kubrickstyle time dimension  didnt we just spend half an hour on this planet reusing some special effects this time made to look like giant waves left over from inception? i think so but time warps so nicely when youre practically snoring i think we lost an astronaut somewhere maybe thats the game whos next? i hope its the astrophysicist who explains wormholes with a moebius strip he forgets to twist either that or it was origami for dummies maybe that *was* the guy we just lost  hard to tell they all act the same flat as the dialogue thanks guys anyway we can only pray it will be hathaway soon shes starting to keep me awake how can a head bob about so much in weightlessness? but im being unfair i think i remember her trying to act some of this script brave move from an oscar winner im starting to want my money back anyway im roused a bit now and thus a bit grumpy were in another galaxys version of antarctica minus the faintest signs of life  this despite because of? the unzipping of a new bad actor fortunately this actor goes even beyond his usual leaden deadness and im soon starting to lose consciousness again and time travel merrily back to the land of nod i think there was a plot twist involved because this astronaut is trying to do a dave and hal routine he must think hes in a good movie poor sod did i mention there must have been yards of inception on the cuttingroom floor last time because im watching more and more outtakes? gotta save a few million here and there i had a dream i dreamed that nolan would come up with a slew of insanely bizarre plot twists right at the end that would explain the entire reason for watching this flick but they carried me out on a stretcher before i found out if it was true apparently i was having a nightmare screaming morse code no no no not morse code thats spielberg at the top of my lungs and disturbing the other patrons naps i was obviously paying too much attention even comatosei got pulled in at the start it turned out like any other mystery action movie all the clues and other attributes etc but there was so many thing that just are so idiotic that it pisses me off i have had so much tension on this from the book thinking it will be amazing but it all went away half way through the movie spoilers the part when she actually tries to make up the part of rape and when she puts wine on her skirt and whatever was so stupid what about the bloody cameras you idiots and if youre going to say she disabled them the what about the actual fake rape scene she sucked his dick and was wearing lingerie for gods sake who wears lingerie randomly if they looked at the cameras to watch the rape then what about the dick sucking and shirt tearing and pulling him in on you then pulling a knife out from under the pillow but what finished it for me was the ending what man like him in their own mind would stay with a murdering bitch like that and still love her this was my opinion you dont have to agree but i just found it so stupidi get the hype really linklaters before trilogy was fantastic i especially loved before midnight and people were justified in expecting great things from boyhood what i dont get are the numerous and nearly uniformly raving reviews this film has been getting from the critics and everyone else im utterly baffled by this critics are using words like masterpiece monumental profound and so on to describe this movie the film is currently sitting at #58 on imdbs top 250 all this praise is making me feel like a crazy person because i felt boyhood absolutely didnt deliver on the hype in fact the movie cant even be described as mediocre i feel like i need to make on thing clear here just because boyhood had the novel idea of shooting a film with the same actors during a long period of time doesnt grant it any automatic points a novel idea or approach may pique my interest and convince me to see a movie but thats as far as it goes we dont appreciate and enjoy movies simply because someone put some effort into them there has to actually be something there to justify spending our precious time and money to watch pixels on a screen for a couple of hours now lets jump into my gripes with the movie firstly boyhood has absolutely no distinct style it is a lifeless husk without form or anything resembling a cinematic look just like one other reviewer put it boyhood felt like watching a home movie about someone you dont know and dont care about i cant remember a single scene where i thought wow thats a neat shot or a moment where some cinematographic choice actually enhanced the scene that tells a lot about the cinematographic effort and choices that were put into this film bland and uninspired is to put it mildly the editing does the film no favors either right when something emotional or important could have happened the movie simply cuts to another scene and doesnt reference or deal with what happened previously in any way it all felt terribly directionless for example mason ellar coltrane gets bullied in a school bathroom okay great probably something many of us can identify with how did it get to this? how does he deal with it later on and how does it affect him? we simply dont know its a wholly detached scene with no meaning at one point theyre planting obama signs on peoples lawns great maybe theyre idealistic about the political system and theyd later revise their views or something? nope none of that is ever mentioned or dealt with in any way again most of the scenes are like this and go absolutely nowhere when the film actually goes back to something that was introduced earlier it feels extremely contrived like with the bit about masons mom advising a latino immigrant about going to school and how he later comes back to thank her for that encouragement really subtle guys there were a few scenes where i was slightly amused and that mostly about how awkward the scene was but mostly i was just constantly cringing at how bad the acting and the writing were i guess thats the risk you run into when you cast young actors and stay with them for twelve years  they might just not be that good at acting ellar coltrane seemed like hed had a shot of horse tranquilizer before every scene hes that apathetic and dull the characters have no real depth or character arcs and i didnt care or get attached to any of them masons philosophic rants were cringeworthy and uninteresting they also seem to come out of nowhere and therefore feel unearned at no point did i think that they really struck a chord with what it was like growing up during the 90s and the 2000s i was simply depressingly bored for most of the movie many have complimented this movie about being close to real life well thats debatable but that shouldnt be an automatic positive either watching paint dry and standing in the line in the grocery store is real life too i dont want to see banal mindlessness when i go to the movies but maybe thats just me a film this ambitious should really have something original to say instead it just wasted my timei found this movie to be overly long full of itself endlessly oppressive virtually humorless and overall not worth your time thats my summary but in order to add imdbs required 10 lines on the plus side it was well made so it does draw you in but the long scenes in space juxtaposed with the ugly scenes on earth were just too much for me to watch i eventually sat with my eyes closed so as not to continue to be bombarded by those scenes i didnt want to leave as i had gone with others and eventually covered my ears for the same reason the scenes may be beautifully shot but they are in the end very slow and boring this film should have been half the length and have added twice as much lightnessi found this film very disturbing and it was a waste of my time going to see the film i found that it took awhile to understand the story and there wasnt much of an introduction of the characters throughout the entire film i thought that johnny depp was better in the pirate of the caribbeans franchise overall the film was ok in some parts of the film can the makers of the film please make a better version of the movie and call it a different name and maybe if they put more work into it and had better scripts i would be more satisfied with the film i recommend this film to people who hate science fiction as it really brings out the weaknesses and errors that occurs in sciencei followed this series through the first season and kept thinking this guy stephen amellhas got to get better some how well that hasnt materialized i dont think stephen amell could make someone think he had to defaecate if he had a box of laxatives i i came across someone in real life with the emotion the characters display in this series im assume right away that they needed mental help its like people who didnt work out anywhere else all wound up here such a huge pool of bad talent and whats up with the mother and daughter do they have herpes? what the hell is on their lips?grossi dont usually give a 110 even for utter trash everything about this movie is a liepropaganda peasants love johnny depp and morgan freeman so the popular guys are playing the scientists rushing to replace humanitys future with an ai they control which will answer the deep mysteries of life just good guys with good intentions? right? look up ray kurzweil who is director of engineering at google there are mega rich people funding ai research and want to become gods or immortal when their personalities are uploaded onto the internet so will caster is a smug atheist who isnt working with government bulls*** and he is poisoned by a terrorist trying to save humanity o lets try and upload him into a computer not because he would love to be a god but because some terrorist killed him bulls*** basically transcedence is richest 1% getting overruling over the rest of us even after death the horrori dont understand why this movie has 85 imdb rating its pretty boring movie acting is pretty lame its not engaging at all basically if you are not under 13 youll start yawning and checking your phone more than the movie i felt like im watching a live play act rather than a movie direction acting and animation felt like it was done by amateurs ive seen better acting in a fan base remake of other movies and better animation in video game trailers there are quite a few scenes where its so dark that you cant make anything out storyline is very short and not enough for a movie in the end it shows that they will be back next time or something i hope they dont as i wont be watching it at least not in the theater anyways waste of timei dont know why walt disney movies have become so dull and tasteless the story of cinderella is a great storybut the acting is simply terrible and the movie is so boring the story of

unaware that he is really the prince and not merely an employee at the palace ella finally feels she has met a kindred soul it appears as if her fortunes may be about to change when the palace sends out an open invitation for all maidens to attend a ball raising ellas hopes of once again encountering the charming kit alas her stepmother forbids her to attend and callously rips apart her dress but

black hole and i dont understand why the black hole can flash i means though some energy can escape from the black hole but the visible light does not have the enough energy i guest there are other very obvious mistakes haha it is said that the hero gets in the 5d space let us make an example in 1d world the ant would be blocked by a spot however when the ant get into the 2d world the spot would not be the block anymore which means the block in lower dimension would not be the block anymore in a higher dimension thus if the hero gets in the 4d world i dont think he would be block in the black hole and he gets in the 5d world~~~~ hahai dont have a huge amount to say about this film as i feel absolutely nothing happens within the space of 3 very long hours for those of you who have taken the time to read my review and have watched the film i have a question would you praise this film to the extent that is has been if you hadnt watched the actors grow up over the course of 12yrs? would this film have been as critically acclaimed if they had used different actors as they grew like the majority of films? my personal answer is no and my reason being that the dialogue is tedious thrown in with a lot of unlikable characters im not denying the concept is brilliant and original however overall this film did nothing for me except remind me the annoyance of pubertyi do not understand any of the good reviews of this movie i think that its hook is the gimmick of the kids growing up in it but there is nothing redeeming or even entertaining about this movie it was terrible the story bordered on depressing the trailer leads one to believe that this is a documentary of a childs life but it is not there are actors in it it was awful just awful and i do hope it will not end up winning an oscar surely someone could do a coming of age movie better or a documentary set over 12 years better i wish i could understand what the reasoning behind the good reviews i watched the movie and i just cannot see iti do not know what kind of pr team the production team has hired to promote this film but obviously they are doing great job as it has already higher score than inception seriously guys??? this film has 510 stars at best and even that for just potential rest of it is lost because the film has absolutely no logic to it stupid illogical and at times really boring and long even though i am no scientist it was so stupid on so many levels with even the most basic of facts that i have no comments to this set your expectations low no way in hell does this film deserve any of that praise posted herei didnt always vote on imdb but if my twocents could warn people not to let their hope up on this movie or not waste their time watching at all i would however if you like a lousy crime thriller film wannabe this one is your very choice i am wondering why gone girl is getting a pretty good score here 84 huh? are you kidding me? are people not seeing that noticeably fat plot hole? i had raised my brows at how cops in this movie worked since their first appearance the writer had no knowledge how the system worked but he dare try to write a crime fiction he used many wrong imagination so what we got and paid for is this pieceofs i mean art gone girl tells a story of a manipulative lady who got a bunch of idiots around her so compared to them she was real smart one day she thought shed set her cheating husband up for a murder so she sent him out and drove her evil plan in motion she drew out her blood threw it around the house then cleaned the house not knowing when her husband would come home and discover all of it luckily he didnt come home before she got away for her everything was perfect timing and a piece of cake as the film went on and on everybody believed what she said and ate what she served without any doubts in their mind this sounds very mary sue to me every cops in the writers world worked like an amateur they worked fast too fast but use no brains they didnt work the evidences or traced any phones they used only what she fed them fbi wouldnt do anything about a bloody murder even though the feds had the murderer sitting in front of them soaking in blood confessing and not even feeling freaked out although she told the cops that she had been kidnapped and raped and then the cops let her husband drive her home still soaking in blood when i saw that scene i was going to fall apart thats it thats the whole story tell me she used some kind of dark magic that would be more reasonable than everybody in the world being an idiot and listening to this mary sues words regardless this movie was disappointingi decided to give this film a go out of a love for classic disney pre digital angelina jolies striking image and the fantasy element sadly angelina jolies image is the only successful aspect of this film what a surprise that is the only image associated with the film elle fanning is in the kindest terms distinctly average and certainly not blessed with grace or a beauty by any great stretch of the imagination neither can she act sharlto copley is also incredibly overrated and should only be considered for minor supporting roles there is no character development copleys character is shown as a love interest then we are told not shown that he is ambitious next thing he is evil and cuts off maleficents wings and becomes inherently bad  this makes no sense when maleficent finds her wings stolen we see her mourn for them for a few seconds at most next thing she is evil while the cgi is good the fairy fantasy element is shallow  remember how rich with emotion action humour and charm the animal scenes were in snow white and the seven dwarfs? i expected a certain amount of darkness and menace something to give us an emotional journey  this was completely lacking all in all a wasted opportunity of a film it would be forgettable if it didnt infuriate me so muchi created an imdb account because of this movie it is the worst dragged out boring try hard words i dont think exist garbage ive ever seen please give me my money and 3 hours of life back when im on my deathbed in 5060 hopeful years riddled with dementia and parkinsons divorced 8 times with kids who hate me and nothing but an unmarked grave to look forward to my biggest regret in life will no doubt be watching this film i wanted to jump off my 12th story balcony 30 minutes in i wanted to jump off my 12th story balcony strapped to a flaming 2 tonne anvil with a noose around my neck and 8 pounds of plastic c4 set to detonate on impact 1 hour in so on and so forth why did i finish watching you ask? well cause i was hoping pleading praying to the holy jesus lord above that this movie would get better maybe have an exciting plot twist maybe just maybe not continue being a dreadfully boring and inconceivably lame story of a teenager and his regular as f**k life and then what boom? its over? at least give me a micheal bay explosion on that bland cliff hes sitting on thats it im done not wasting anymore time on this horrible boring waste of my according to this film thrilling life tips for watching this movie step 1 wait for it to come out on dvd step 2 take out massive loan from bank step 3 buy all the copies you can of this movie step 4 put all copies through wood chipper step 5 burn with fire step 6 cry tears of joy for being a superhero step 7 weep tears of sorrow for all those who find this movie deserves ten stars for i cant begin to imagine the excitement of a day in their livesi couldnt rate any lower than 1 so i guess it gets a 1 how on earth does this stuff get green lit? i dont understand this type of movie may have been good in 1981 but in 2014 there is no excuse the plot is completely ludicrous the dialogue is horrible i think hes fragmented seriously? i found myself bursting out with laughter at the ridiculousness of the entire movie how many eye rolling minutes can you pack into a movie? id rather watch paint dry complete and utter failure i love movies i love when i watch a movie and i am reminded why i love movies it will take 23 good movies to get over the sour taste this movie left in my mouth avoid at all costs do not give them a reason to even consider making something else along these linesi could not have believed quite how bad interstellar is it is truly dreadful after six months travelling with just 12 minutes to go to entering the wormhole the token blackman speaks to the hero who has his suntan intact massa massa what is going on? the hero then takes a piece of paper and explains to the poor ignorant black man how space warps in a wormhole if he didnt know this wtf was he doing on the trip? their understanding of relativity is at the level id expect from my goldfish they give plenty of time to grotesque emotional watching of film clips from earth  for some reason in b&w the hero goes through as dorothy parker said all the emotions from a to b they claim it is a post colonial world but the space suits all have the us flag on them the spaceship controls are circia 1960 poor michael cain is he so short of money that he has to be pare of this shite? to be fair it is unconsciously funny from time to time because it is so utterly clueless avoid this film if you possibly cani checked the spoiler box just in case but nothing happens nothing to spoil huge waste of time everyone is allowed to formulate their own opinion about movies but i would highly recommend to stay away from boyhood this movie is terrible it is filmed over a twelve year period yes twelve same actors and actresses the movie is 2 hours 46 minutes long and we had to turn it off at 2 hours2 hours of my life i will never get back i love all kinds of movies action adventure drama comedy even a chick flick now and then but this movie went nowhere did nothing and ended up like every other person in life see it for yourself but you have been warned cant figure out how its up for 6 award nominations other than the artsy fartsy crowd loves this kind of crapi cant believe they wasted one of the best tv shows ever simply to make a vehicle for an increasingly geriatric tom cruise and i cant believe that constant bulgy teary eyes topgun gape and all caps sentences every annoying moment of the movie is what defines good acting in hollywood these days sigh and what is there to think about in this movie?? tom cruise in starting frame tom cruise gets double teamed tom cruise gets mad tom cruise gets teary eyed tom cruise exclaims constantly did you order the code red tom cruise kills bad guy with a helicopter and a train tom cruise saves the day tom cruise in last frame has any tom cruise movie been any different?? i wish that helicopter blade had made those two extra inchessigh would have made my dayi cant believe anyone found this movie even mildly entertaining let alone brilliant even more preposterous are the comparisons to 2001???? like all of nolans other movies interstell im not going to write synopsis or give details but simply share my opinion there was nothing even remotely good about this film it attempted to blend ideas and plots from past scifi films but in the end turned out to be a disconnected and poorly developed mess everything from the crap science to the uninteresting characterscheesy and awkward dialog to the story or lack thereof made this film unwatchable the characters did not come off like scientists they didnt even come off like people in such dire situations would such as making jokes about being an asshole when confronted by a massive black hole anne hathaways character was particularly inferior i seriously wanted someone to strangle her of course this could have been excused if the movie didnt take itself so serious or had some redeeming qualitiesaspects however the film tries so hard to be profound but it ends up being awkward the endi cannot understand how such a capable cast could make such a dog of a movie didnt they read the script before they accepted the roles? the premise of the film is stupid and as such assumes people are stupid add this to the ponderous and boring pace of the movie a bunch of uninteresting characters who are impossible to relate to and a totally predictable and contrived ending on it and you have all the ingredients of a hollywood trainwreck the dvd was described as action this is false advertising what little action there is is about as exciting as watching paint dry the copy i rented had the worst case of bad sound really soft dialogue contrasted with action sounds that almost took the back wall out of my lounge room if i werent so bored maybe i wouldnt have noticed im really glad i didnt pay more than an overnight rental on this but really wish i could have the 2 or so hours of my life i wasted watching this rubbish backi cannot believe there is people that liked this movie not only it lacks any kind of realism any kind of acting and any kind of plot but also it shows us such an old load of clich_ that you will be asking for your money back it seems to be impossible for this movie being directed by brian de palmai cannot believe there is people that liked this movie not only it lacks any kind of realism any kind of acting and any kind of plot but also it shows us such an old load of clich that you will be asking for your money back it seems to be impossible for this movie being directed by brian de palmai cannot believe how disappointed i was watching this film form all of the reviews i thought i was about to see a modern classic in instead i watched a movie so lacking in common sense that the last hour was almost unwatchable the plot is very obvious even the ending without giving away any plot lines it seems that in this film common sense and the trail of evidence does not exist once the real story is revealed as the last hour of the movie dragged on and on i was hoping for some redeeming scene that would make everything right or at least make sense unfortunately this did not happen maybe one of the worst good movies ive ever scene if this is what people think is good plot twists then the iq of movie watchers has gone down into the single digitsi can not understand why anyone would enjoy this movie i actually got up and walked out halfway through there was so much gratuitous violence that i couldnt stand it splattering blood everywhere in order to explain myself there will be a few spoilers here but i will try and keep them to a minimum so if you want to be surprised dont read any further but i wouldnt be surprised if i were you we were and i am still angry about it i will say that several of the cast members were very good the premise of the movie is juvenile 5 minutes into the movie someone got split in half this gimmick was repeated later in the movie samuel jackson plays a black billionaire who dresses like flava flav and serves mcdonalds to who he thinks is a billionaire donor seriously? then there was the whole shoot the dog bit really how original but when everyone started killing each other in the church i was done if you are a thirteen year old boy with anger issues this movie is right up your alley i went on line to read what happens at end of the movie and was glad i made the decision to leave the movie how many times to you blow up a persons head and call it entertainment? it really bothers me that some people find this entertaining this was one step above a snuff film masquerading as a parodyhomage to james bond also am i the only one who got the subliminal message with the obama look alike who gets killed? seriously? there are not enough words to describe how bad this movie is if you enjoy blood and people getting killed rather graphically ad nausea then you will enjoy this movie if you want to see anything remotely resembling a decent movie you will noti came here to check the reviews and i was mislead so here i am hoping that people will see this and not bother first thing that you notice is the bad actingpersonal opinion and man that is annoying the show itself is decent but not much of plot development and the story is repeating and boring so unless they have something hidden that is gonna blow our mind im gonna have to stop watching this show if you have a lot of time to spend you can watch it but dont expect much from it or you will be very very disappointed another thing that hits you after a couple episode is the over the board acting with punch line here and there i know it sounds like a lot of hate but just so you know this is my first review in imdb i always come here to check some of them this show is overrated and doesnt deserve the reviews in herei bought the studio hype that this was the most intelligent sicfi film since 2001 space odyssey what an insult to kubrick like the dark knight rise interstellar is 3 long hours of torture from the moment mccanaughey accidentally stumbles upon nasas gigantic secret launch operation  just happens to be in a cornfield a few miles from him and they never noticed and by the way as long as youre here could you pilot the mission? we just never had any plans for a pilot until you barged in christ this is a plot device from gilligans island the rest of this turkey might be summed up as weepy soap opera in outer space too many schmaltzy tearjerker scenes for an intelligent sicfi film anne hathaway acts more like a chirpy cheerleader than a seasoned astronaut and like dark knight the plot is so convoluted that i eventually gave up caring the final scenes perhaps somewhat inspired by 2001 are lame and pretentious id rather be waterboarded than suffer through nolans dreck again im giving this 1 star to balance the ludicrous spate of 910 star reviews no wonder american film has gone downhill when the audiences mistake a pretentious poorly written fruit pie for the masterpiece of a geniusi am wondering if the people who write intertstellar 10star reviews are actually sane or if they base their opinion on a movie library completely deprived of everything that is scifi basically if the sicfi component  most of which does not really happen until the end  is removed from the plot the movie by and large is a classic hollywood soap opera the wornout rag of clich family relations all americandad complicated love affair unruly and a classic tomboygirl coworkers more like coidiots who rebel and despite all common sense act irrationally you know to up the ante it really makes up 90% of this movie up until half way trough i honestly considered walking away from this boring tragedy which is the lack of creative talent on the part of the script writers and director there are also very obvious holes in the plot and not just irregularities but direct contradictions that even the most obnoxious sicfi movies at least try to amend somehow i can not help but think that after watching automata which was a breath of fresh air in many regards this movie is like walking into a small toilet where someone just took a huge dump it is literally that bad what saves this movie by the skin of its teeth is the ending so just watch that instead because until then you could have just as well been watching an episode of santa barbara spolers about ridiculous plot holes as if the soap part of the movie is not stressed enough 1 the stupid dust bowl recycled seriously? i am not even going to try to explain this because id need to repost have of wikipedia here but it does not work that way not in the past  not in the future 2 the moment nasa abducts the main character and daughter and questions them seriously? maybe they should also have shot them on sight? 3 nasas facility is top secret right in the age supposedly after the present when there are drones and google maps they manage to hide a huge facility in some old james bond villain fashion 4 lets go to another galaxy ok if the movie shows a fairly conventional rocket carrying a futuristic shuttle why for the love of all holy would anyone risk going there  instead of looking in our own? what they really expected to have better luck there  than in our own? they already searched the entire milky way? and whats even better  it just so happens there is a planet like a stones throw away from the black hole and is not being consumed by it and somehow a black hole which is now proved to be a collapsed star is anything but a collapsed star? why lets just start diving down toilets because you know they are not full of s*** but are actual doorways to different dimensions like dimensions of dementia perhaps 5 saving the best for last  i did like the ending despite its absurdity i did like it almost cried  if i were a 14 year old girl with especially fragile psychology but i digress the machine that allows the main character to conviniently contact his daughter in the future past is built by the very humanity he is trying to save that survived and built the machine in the future lord have mercy i will try to explain this so basically if we consider all major theories about time travel in order to change the future one must go there and change it right? but here the future changes the past and that past is what changed the future with the help of the future that is changed in the past with the changed futures help mind >>> blowni am wondering if the people who write intertstellar 10star reviews are actually sane or if they base their opinion on a movie library completely

people will figure out their mistake lets face it the plot is ridiculous working around a music themed heroic saga through the galaxy when the songs themselves are either plain bad or do not represent quite well the moment plot problems will also go by too many characters presented in a way that seems like weve seen them before but we dont really remember where from well maybe another movie like the collector nova prime or korath and many many clich_s but the worse part for me was the cheesy dialogs and the absolutely ridiculous jokes i couldnt laugh even once and i do tend to have a good sense of humor the joke about slipping the finger on your neck  really? and rocket demanding a mans artificial leg for nothing to say later that that was a joke  absolutely unnecessary on top of its nonsense the final scene ronan is about to finally get his revenge has the power to do so is about to do so then at the very last moment he stops to watch quill dancing while others prepare to blast him oh forget the fulfilling of my greatest desire the one driving my whole life and existence lets just stop and watch him dance seriously? was that supposed to be funny? am i a tenyearold boy watching woodpecker? 2 min of thinking would have sufficed to come up with a not so childish way to do that scene what a great plot indeed maybe i could be going too hard on a film supposed to just entertain with lights and sound but it bothers me how stupid they think we are when they treat us like children one very good side though that saved this movie from total awfulness is the beautiful cgi images not all but many specially those from space and star warslike spaceship battles every single other marvel movie was better than this  and not all were exactly good if the sequence is going to be as good as the first one please dont even start it marvel and not to forget some one has to tell nasa that to prevent people from dying from a spacecraft falling down on earth you just need to make a sphere shield made out of entangled branches and leaves awesomei am so disappointed in this movie the ratings gave me high expectations for this movie but i feel really let down this movie was meant to capture the true essence and experience of growing up and going through life it is directed and acted out so neutrally to try to make the movie as real as possible but this is not reality reality has more emotion more struggle more comedy and more life life is not an objective biography or recollection of events it is a subjective frenzy i can make a movie of me watching this movie and make it more alive tldr this movie about life is more boring than life itselfi am sick and tired of hollywoods inaccuracies in the films they produce from amistads horrendous lies about its stories of slavery to tyler perry making me believe that he is an actual elderly black woman hollywood keeps pooping out new flicks that focus entirely on the entertainment and not at all on the facts and its safe to say that boyhood was the worst of all this movie made me so livid that i wanted to cut my freaking cats ear off the film portrayed a boy as he grew from five to seventeen years old in front of the audiences eyes he lived in a mostly happy household with only a few minor obstacles but nothing too severe that the family couldnt handle it except that one part the people who have viewed the film will know what part i mean boyhood did not represent childhood in a realistic way and it especially did not represent my childhood i was born in a small town in nebraska on the dance floor of a strip club off the interstate where my mom happened to be dancing that night many people took their dollars back off the stage the moment i popped out i emerged from my mothers uterus with a feeling of ambition a feeling that i could take the world by storm however my father a flight attendant had other plans for me once i got my basic motor movements down he had me training to be just like your old man as he put it pops made me train for hours on end serving drinks and peanuts to family friends and relatives while always keeping a phony smile on my face by the age of three i knew the safety procedure speech like the back of my hand and keep in mind this was before i even knew the alphabet or my own name all i ever wanted to do was juggle for a living i once told him about my desire to attend juggling camp for a week over the summer he replied by saying i bet youd like to handle all those balls wouldnt you? stick to flight attending son its a mans job i was devastated the idea of being able to keep more than one ball in the air at a time mesmerized me for years to come but i could never make my dreams known for fear of what my father might do once i graduated from high school my dad pulled some strings and got me a job as a flight attendant at the nearest airport he had retired at this point he said he did it because 911 really sucked balls he was so excited that i was following or should i say flying in his footsteps but the day i was supposed to start the job i did not make it to the airport for i was on my way to follow my dreams i hit the open road looking for the nearest juggling college the existential feeling of bliss that i felt from the freedom of being out of my fathers control was more than i had ever felt before but it quickly diminished for i learned that there is no such thing as juggling college amateur mistake blake amateur mistake i ran out of money fast having spent it all on an expensive juggling set i had planned on showing off to all the other kids at juggling college so that i could be one of the cool kids i hooked for a little bit but no one would take my body i have a bad hunching problem and a massive rash on my back so it kind of looks like molten lava rushing down the side of a volcano when i take my shirt off i had nowhere to go no one to turn to for many a days i ate garbage from a dumpster behind burger king which i know sounds redundant since their food is already garbage i got food poisoning thrice over the course of a year reluctantly i knew what i had to do i tucked my tail in between my legs and made the long journey home back to my parents i knocked on the door and asked my dad for forgiveness no son of mine will be a juggler not on my watch he yelled but dad i pleaded you are forever shunned from this household he said with an icy look then he slammed the door in my weary face i am still homeless i have no money and nowhere to go i recently beat a man with one of my expensive juggling pins in a fight over a box of raisin bran its brutal out there let me tell you i figured out this family was going on vacation for a couple weeks so i am currently squatting in their home i came to see boyhood because i rented it on their credit card and i am also stealing their internet to write this review i just needed to get my thoughts on how unrealistic boyhood was out in the open because i checked and i didnt see anyone else complaining about this i mean cmon hollywood where was the part about flight attendants? where were the parts about the boys love for juggling and his dads denial of any pursuit of the boys dreams? huh????? because tell me if im wrong but i didnt catch those parts it really baffles me how well you hollywood bigwigs botched this great idea for a movie call me when you make a good movie for once im done with this bs ps dont call me because i dont own a phone because im homeless because my dad shunned me for my love of juggling sincerely your fellow imdb user blakelogsdon1i am really amazed at the good reviews this is getting on here as i found it a huge disappointment absolutely nothing about it makes any sense in fact no single moment in the film follows logically from anything that was happening 15 minutes earlier the science is ridiculous a sixinch deep ocean with 200foot waves is one of the more believable elements the motivation of the characters changes from minute to minute and they seem bound and determined to make the worst choice whenever faced with a decision the special effects are unimaginative kubrick did it all better without cgi 50 years ago the bombastic musics only virtue is that it drowns out the ludicrous dialogue and the final resolution of the central mystery is utterly nonsensical involving manually transmitting what must be many many gigabytes of data in morse code via the second hand of an old wristwatch wt*? definitely not recommendedi am not a huge fan of blockbusters so maybe i am not the target audience of this movie but i do enjoy them from time to time but this movie was a huge disappointment and frankly it was one of the worst mainstream movies i have seen in cinemas granted i have not seen many movies in cinemas in recent years it reminded me of another movie which i consider as one of my least favourite movies wanted to be honest there are many elements of that movie that have been used in this movie and frankly it seemed like a partial remake of that one the first problem was maybe colin firth i thought he was so incredibly miscast it seemed awkward to see him do the church fight and the fight with the thugs he was saying such corny annoying lines which would not seem out of place in one of those bollywood movies where the hero is all powerful even in comparison those movies at least seem more original many of the characters reminded me of many older movies the same old rough kid being trained to fight story has been done over and over again the whole banter between the posh guys and eggsy is cringeworthy the lead actor who played the role of eggsy has zero presence and is pretty much forgettable he really doesnt have the look for such a role i guess also this movie was mostly supposed to be funny but most of the humor elements fall absolutely flat what was the point of the head explosions? that was absolutely the worst scene that i have seen in cinemas in recent years i expected something much more substantial and believable but that really disappointed me the church fight was also stupid and meaningless just meaningless violence but without the beauty of john woo or even movies like the matrix the whole movie is so cynically geared to getting a reaction from teenage boys i am just surprised that there was no eye candy pretty much throughout the movie sure there were women but there are no suggestive sexual scenes maybe that last one in the end and another thing that i disliked was the use of classic rock music like freebird it seemed like an insult to this song to be associated with such tripe now lastly the presence of samuel jackson didnt really elevate the movie much he does better than the other actors but as far as i can remember he doesnt really have many memorable lines or scenes in this movie but i am thankful he is involved in the movie since that made it a little bearable for me and i was able to finish it there are just too much unbelievable fight scenes and ridiculous things like head explosions which have been done more realistically by tom savini in low budget 80s movies church fights and so on i know my rating is a little harsh since samuel jackson is not so bad but i am just rating as far as my personal experience is concerned 310i am a bit of a cinema buff and i have seen quite a few efforts from all over the world dating back to the very dawn of the art form this is worst film i have ever seen  it looked like an amateur home video to me except it was much much much much much longer too absurd and stupid to be really boring however this pseudo intellectual psychological stink bomb probably is held in awe by lovers of star wars and starbucks coffee the only fun i had while watching this disaster was trying to guess how it would end well i also had fun laughing at how badly written this movie was so i suppose in that sense i have to admit it was enjoyable to participate in this flaccid collapsing 911 of cinema i kept asking my girl friend when will this end? a few times i thought they were ready to pull the plug but no  like dracula it seemed to have eternal life it kind of just petered out one day and i think that maybe they just ran out of money or someone pounded a stake through the plastic kodak fixed focus they were using as a camera they certainly didnt run out of ideas because there were none to be found i am really astounded at how amateurish this piece of garbage was sorry i really cant do a more thoughtful profound review of this mess  my brain just wont do iti always liked sifi movies the alien saga 2001 space odyssey gravity and even star wars of course they invite you to dream about extraterrestrial creatures exploration of the cosmos interstellar fights and what might be like living beyond the earth well interstellar falls very short at that why? simply because it goes well beyond what it is possible and lets keep it clear i am stating that in a bad sense after nasas orion struggles on building a shuttle to send humans to asteroids and even mars for the sake of what? interstellar illustrates us how to even get into black holes scape out of them and see your own daughter dying while you still have more energy and time to keep procreating what is next? it is a shame that a gang can keep you nearly three hours while getting your money to brief you about real science and the new fifth dimension with which that you can communicate through the 3d space and time bad bad and badhow disney could take a classic story involving a wonderfully evil character and make her into a victim of male abuse is beyond me its a terribly misguided attempt to influence our daughters to mistrust and find fault with men even the wonderful fairies in the original story who saved protected provided love and a good upbringing for snow white have those outstanding feminine qualities taken away from them they are reduced to bumbling caretakers who watch over her until maleficent finds her and eventually becomes her benefactor i dont think we as a society should try to right a wrong with another wrong if the powerful women in hollywood think that hollywood produces movies that portray women in less than desirable ways there is no reason to counter attack with this awful story aimed at the impressionable psyche of our children if you have concerns about your daughters and sons viewing a story about abusive men and psychologically damaged women getting revenge stay away from this movie let children have their childhood and take them to movies that are age appropriatehow can anyone give this film 1010 ? it lasts for 3 hours and for the first hour nothing happens they could have condensed the first hour to 10 minutes poor plot nasa developing a secret base because the public would not support spending on such expensive waste of money err maybe they would have spotted the dirty great big rocket launching and wonder what it was ?? how about picking the most ridiculous planet that orbits a black hole? you would never be able to develop and further space as anything in orbit had 7 years for every hour on the surface that stupid puddle planet  and the statement that the explorer had just arrived in their time due to relativity ?? err it took 2 years for them to get to jupiter where the wormhole was so assuming they did not leave until they reported back they would have been on the surface for 2 years why cant the transmit back real information  i may have missed that when they can send video messages ? sending back fake data about a planet that is frozen and has ammonia i the air so that it looks good is lame as hell you picked someone to go on a mission through a wormhole alone but they crumble about dying on a frozen planet is stupid anyway you could spot what the planet was like from a long long way to know it was fake hmm turning the robot into a bomb that self destructs ? why ? could they not spot when they landed it was fake? ie a frozen landscape for miles around is not what i would have called a viable planet ahh yes and sending messages back through the wormhole using gravity to encode data in the watch ticking using morse code ????? pathetic i had no joy watching this film except when it went off science fiction this is nothis 4th dud in a row a ridiculous plot for some reason the earth is reduced to only producing corn so no animals birds or fish even though the scene by a lake the water looked clean and refreshing seems like humanity have forgotten that we can grow things in greenhouses and even underground never mind lets move on once again nolans characters all scientists and supposedly super intelligent do the most stupid things anne hathaway goes in the water to retrieve a large piece of debris when a large wave appears she has on hand a robot who could lift this wreckage with one hand but does not instruct him to do so the beardy scientist is by the spacecraft door urging her to get a move on the wave gets nearer the robot goes and carries her to the shuttle the beardy scientist all this while stays put just outside the door and lets the wave carry him away just one example of quite fewthe biggest plot hole is this for some reason once cooper is past the black hole and in 5 dimensional space he becomes super intelligient because he now knows how to solve the problem of gravity and save mankind how he knows this we do not know given that he is just an engineer to be able to figure out something the greatest physicists of the last hundred years cannot is unbelievable he then sends probably the most complicated and long equation in history to his daughter in basic morse code anyone familiar with morse code will tell you that this would take forever now to the film making others have mentioned its look  well to me it looked shabby endless shots of aircraft wings no vistas no shots of the galaxy or stars during both the wormhole sequence and the black hole sequence he stays on the actors in close in fact thank god i did not see this in imax would have been a complete waste of time and now the noise with hans zimmers worst and most bombastic score  added onto very loud sound effects with the actors shouting to be heard we came a away with very bad headaches the end did not make any sense at all but we have the usual nolan fan base that cannot see past their noses all going ape over this and the usual batch of critics with no critical faculties whatsoverheres the bottom line i think there should be an exception for these imdb reviews considering theres really nothing of absolute revelation or a spectacular climax everything you thought of going on in an ordinary persons life that could happen happens thats it again this isnt a spoiler you already knew what happens in this movie before even seeing the trailers trust me youre not missing anything stay home and watch videos of your own family through the years youll be happy you did i will add that if ethan hawke wins the oscar for supporting actor i wouldnt have a problem with it he did do a good job at the rolehaving built high expectations from an almost 10 out of 10 imdb rating and portrayed as a great spy thriller in the reviews we went to watch the movie but were extremely and totally disappointed and disgusted with everything in the movie the storyline and direction were aimless and weak the actors were made to show off their horribly cheap and duplicate quality james bond type weaponry tricks and style the movies plot and screening seems so stupid that the director would have been better off creating a spoof for a james bond type movie instead anyway such movies always get made but what i am most disappointed about is the fact that the imdb reviews & ratings were completely rigged imdb you need to watch out for such flaws in your feedback system cos that will bring down the rating of your service in process my suggestion if you are really really still interested in watching this movie then wait for a couple of week and it should be on tv for a free time passhated it most boring film of the year couldve followed someone a bit interesting for ten years rather than this boring tripe sit around the kitchen table go to school kitchen table school father in law gets drunk school table etc etc you get the idea thats it in a nutshell sorry for all the spoilers but turkey of the year for me do not understand how so many people like it probably many boring people relate to it hope it doesnt win any oscars there are many other films more worthy just because this is a unique film doesnt make it a good one acting is terrible and there is no plot obviously its just a 3 hour documentary following a family who get divorced but are still friends but im struggling to see the story here surely if you are going to do something as clever as is at least make it worthwhile most kids growing up have a trip to hospital it an accident this kid doesnt nowt didnt even have a personalityhard to sit through and terribly misleading its a shame that such content can be shown in our theaters commemorating death advocating women as sex symbols or damsels in distress and portraying mass murder as a cool action scene the first third of the movie has great action scenes that one would expect from a spy film easy to compare to the bond films however as the movie progressed the entire validity of the characters morals were flushed down the drain i and my two other adult friends had to cover our eyes and grimace at many scenes and we left all agreeing that we did not sign up for that sort of film the trailer did an awesome job at capturing my excitement then the movie did an equally great job of shattering that excitement i stress please watch at your own discretionhahahahhahahah this is the most original thing ive seen in the past years if only it were a comedyparody  thinking of it actually its funnier this way so nvm the comedyparody statement before i go on i have to say that ive never read green arrow but this is not the case here at all why its funny? for starters look at the review title this series is actually a soap opera everything about it is well with the exception that green arrow stars in it the directing is horrid so is the acting and the character lines the story looks ok and id really like to know how it unravels theres also hot women in it not something one wouldnt expect those last two facts are not enough for one to sit and watch it but theyre the reason why i rated with 310 and not 110 what i will do i propose you do the same is start reading the green arrow comic books and google for hot women instead of wasting my time watching this thing it was really fun hilarious tbh watching the first couple of episodes might be three cant recall but enough is enough nextguardians of the galaxy is just another mediocre film under the pretence of future it sneaked in embraces of the past perhaps it tried to be both but it was neither a serious film nor a comedy it failed to trigger any deeper emotion inside me its humour was out of context there were too many characters most of which were not properly developed the purposes of existence of those figures were very confusing ill comment in detail on the triggering of deeper emotions and the humour in the following 2 paragraphs someone commented that the films like the dark knights series set a standard that superhero films must be deep and thoughtful that person further commented that this film guardians of the galaxy challenged this standard i generally dont like dogmas but here its not at all about dogmas it is just the fact that those deep ones could trigger deeper emotions or provoke thoughts or inspire the audiences or help the audiences learn something or help the audiences learn themselves better by these the audiences like think about involuntarily recall remember and give high scores for those deep films of course different people have different opinions on deepness so i dont comment on the deepness of guardians of the galaxy just commenting on triggering deeper emotions or provoking thoughts or inspiring me or helping me learn something or learn myself better unfortunately guardians of the galaxy did none of these to me so it just didnt make me feel that way that it was one of those alltime great films someone commented that guardians of the galaxy was not a serious film but rather it was a great lighthearted comedy even for this i dont think i could agree great humour exists in context in the right context something plain could be hilarious out of context brilliant jokes were just nothing in guardians of the galaxy too much humour ran out of context for example the raccoon said later that he asked for one prisoners prosthetic leg was just a joke what did this convey? it was clever to play such heartless jokes on your partners when it was time to be serious? no how about it tried to portray a figure the raccoon who was unfazed in front of great danger? but then you had to make the situation look dangerous even in the wizard of oz 1939 the scenes felt more creepy than here in the prison the prison here felt just like a noisy secondhand market so i didnt find the joke funny and didnt know why it was in the film otherwise either there were many such lines i knew they were intended to be something to make people laugh but i just didnt feel that entertained at those improper moments all in all guardians of the galaxy has no place on the alltime great list perhaps it was the last joke it could play on itself being put into the top 250 list among those great films its mediocrity would just manifest itself just within the first month of its release it dropped 20 places on the top 250 list from the 34th to the 54th as time goes on this film will likely drop further when the enthusiasm fades after its initial surge there are great films like in the name of the father 1993 a beautiful mind 2001 etc they were not on the top 250 list before but gradually rose up and emerged into the alltime great list just on the contrary guardians of the galaxy will gradually drop out of the top 250 listguardians of the galaxy is a new low for marvel and for the comic book sub genre in general no one was clamoring for a movie to be made from the comic book that almost no one had even heard of however because of the marvel brand and the stunning visuals and action sequences this became one of the highest grossing films of the year the film is no more than a cash grab and a stepping stone in setting up the second avengers the characters are trite and obvious and the villain i cant remember his name for the life of me could not have been more inconsequential or underdeveloped groot was the only part of the movie besides the visuals that was mildly interesting the story is ridiculous as well as the setting this movie has a higher rating on imdb than some of the best films of the year including foxcatcher the grand budapest hotel and the theory of everythingguardians of the galaxy has a great 70s soundtrack which is recommended to be listened to on your walkman while on your own adventures rather than as the score to this latest piece of hollywood marvel trash but that doesnt make up for a crap film with a pathetic childish storyline bs joke acting and zero suspense worse than that  it wasted karen gillan who is one of the hottest scifi girls on the planet and can act a whole better than the dumb talentless yanks she has the misfortune to share her pathetic amount of screen time with besides karen who is always fun the only character in this piece of juvenile junk with any charisma is a wooden tree voiced by vin diesel the rest is a total garbage film for the under 5s or idiots to enjoyguardians of the craplaxy its been a while since i gave a comment about movies

promoting it and slaps on the title to an old tv show that no one associated with it ever watched and americans line up like sheep to see it this film along with other blockbusters like the grinch make me ashamed of our film industrymaybe these films are why the french hate us so much hmmmmm some bozo script writer has the wonderful idea to make the bad guy jim phelps he or she remembers hearing the name somewhere and it has a nice ring to it it should you idiothe was the hero from the original series that everyone loved while youre at it why not remake some other old tv shows that feature barney the dinosaur as a child molester or santa claus as an alcoholic? ahhhhhhhh then after irritating all the old fans lets create the dumbest special effects ever and base the entire movie around explosions and stuntseven though the original series used these very sparingly my favorite example was the banal chase sequence there we see the macho tom cruise riding the skids of a helicopter suddenly it blows up and he blasts forward onto the train he is pursuing and lands expertly on the train if this were really attempted it would cost the lives of 67000000 stunt men to get this stunt right providing that the laws of physics no longer applied during the duration of the stunt then because this was such a cool stunt other pictures included very similar stunts for the next year or so i was half expecting to see it in the next elmo movie america wake upstop attending mindnumbing megabudget movies just because they are marketed to us at every turn pssince i first posted this review tom cruises stupid public statements make me wish i could rank the movie lower than a 1man i am getting sick of seeing this guygreat characters intricate plots and an ensemble cast helped define the original mission impossible during the 1960s but the elements that made the original series so strong are all but lost in this first big screen effort it all starts out promising enough when we join the imf in the middle of a mission unfortunatley once the team members are systematically eliminated one by one we leave mission impossible behind and instead stumble into a high tech version of the fugitive with tom cruise again playing himself as he so often has in so many of his films this is a shame considering the strong supporting cast and the potential it had to be an intelligent and intriguing update of the original series the original concept and characters are betrayed by the writers and director brian depalma easy to follow and sit through but ultimately disappointing lets hope they get it right for the sequelgone girl psychopaths and woman beaters the first segment in the movie shows nick and amy dunnes marriage played by ben affleck and rosamund pike one day amy mysteriously disappears all attention is on nick as his reactions to the disappearing of his wife are distant and unsettling after nick is almost proved guilty it is revealed that amy planted all of the evidence in an attempt to get revenge on her husband we were all on her side at this point amys diary revealed that nick had beaten and sexually abused her as well as used all of her savings on senseless buys and then the film completely lost me amy reveals she faked the entire thing nick was not an abuser it is further understood amy has a history of making false rape accusations and more the film makes you sympathize with nick as he has become a victim of a psychopathic wife however nick still remains an incredibly unlikeable character who was taking advantage of a 20yearold amy then returns to her dissatisfied husband at this point i had completely given up on the film and was just waiting to see nick leave his psychopathic wife of course that wont happen instead the film ends with nick being trapped with amy after she confesses that she stole his sperm and impregnated herself gone girl had great potential but its plot twists ruined the film the acting was decent but the direction completely blurred the message if there even was a message at times even the actors looked like they couldnt believe how terrible the film was ultimately gone girl was unsatisfying and deeply disturbing but not in a good way the film tried way too hard to shock the audience but simply left us confused and deeply regretting ever even watching it gone girl was simply a huge waste of two hoursgone girl is based on a rather absurd premise a careful psychotic plot to frame somebody for your own murder this type of idea is clearly deranged but hopefully it does not cross too many peoples mind the idea was developed much better in the great noir film leave her to heaven where the framing was done in a slightly more subtle way but we do not live in subtle times so here we get plenty of gore and graphic violence even if this would be a spoiler for the few who still do not know the plot the story revolves around unhappy couple amy and nick ben affleck woody and expressionless as usual is creepy nick the unfaithful husband who for half an hour is the main suspect for the disappearance of amy beautiful rosamund pike is psycho crazy wife amy a woman with a demented agenda and several loose screws she manipulates every man she meets and at the end of the movie even police detectives are more than happy not to open an investigation on her crimes just because she is a beautiful blonde and they believe everything she said amys plotting is given away much too soon in the movie so we spend two very long hours just following the demented blonde around and nick getting in big trouble only for amy to resurface and deciding to spend the rest of her life with the husband she wanted to see executed does it make much sense? apparently yes since critics and lots of imdb users loved itgod this show just doesnt get better when i saw the imdb ratings i thought i should give the show a try i mean it had an 8+ on imdb and i dont typically watch anything below 7 alright so apparently the show must be for someone else than me because after starting to watch it nothing justifies the good scores okay so i kept going hoping that i was missing something  or maybe the good stuff just came later? but im now in the middle of season 3 and i have never wasted as much time as i have watching arrow who wrote *read stole* that plot? its not even stolen very well as it is obviously much much worse than any similar vigilante plots out there and you just after a few shows you will know exactly what will happen next and think to yourself no they wouldnt say that or do this cause that would just be dumb unoriginal and lame and then bum it happens and you get so embarrassed for the director honestly more than half of the episode i had to look away of embarrassment god i really dont understand how this show could get more than 55 at maximum so heres the main points  incredibly bad acting  plot is stolen directly from other novels & movies such as for instance batman  hell even ras al guhl is in it which is a monstrous disgrace  editing mediocre  not even the action scenes are good  no original bad guys either  what does it do good? well i guess i think i saw a lamborghini aventador somewhere in season 2 alright 2 stars  1 for the lambo and the other for the ability to fool such a large audience and somehow make it this far without being a total flop beyond my mind to figure out stay away dont waste your hours this show isnt even good for a rainy day unless youve already watched everything else there is to watch and even then id consider doing something else thats more exciting and less predictable  such as playing chessgo colonize mars instead what was the point of the mission? to save humanity how? by evacuating all of earth on huge space stations to another planet accessible through a black hole near saturn and you need to gather data about the singularity to finish the antigravity equation to do it 1 direct trip from earth to saturn = 8 round trips from earth to mars so go colonize mars instead also the robot design was very impractical ps who colonizeslands on a planet with a 1 hour = 7 years outside time anomaly? pointless suicidefor the life of me i cannot understand how this movie has received an 88 rating nor can i understand mathew mcconaughey he mumbles his way through the movie in such a thick texas drawl that english sub tittles are required not that he has anything interesting to say nor do any of the other characters for that matter so lets have a look at the plot the world has become pretty much uninhabitable due to some kind of climate change which has forced everyone to quit their jobs and become farmers the only solution to this problem is to send a rocket into space to locate a suitable planet for colonisation however everybody still drives around in massive gas guzzling suvs is there something wrong with this picture? in the normal run of events it would be impossible to travel the distances required to find another inhabited planet however a worm hole has been located somewhere near saturn which will facilitate interstellar travel its explained that this worm hole has not just appeared but rather it was placed there by some unspecified entity who is watching out for the human race so this unspecified entity has watched the human race make a complete horlicks of one perfectly good planet and now wants to give us the opportunity to do the same on another world? much hokum ensues regarding relativity and the way 1 hour for the astronauts is 10 years back on earth etc and it turns out in the end that it all has something to do with love but by the time they come to this conclusion i had lost interest the visual effects arent all that special seen it all before in fact i think the effects in 2001 aso which this film is so earnestly trying to emulate were superior if not in their execution than certainly in their creative vision in conclusion then a plot holier than a month of sundays a leading man to whom english is a second language nonsense dialogue and rather unimaginative visual effects adds up to 88? i dont think sofirstly i need to say that i have mixed feelings about the director richard linklater and his movies i like his movies but i dont like his style i follow his movies but i dont particularly enjoy his way of storytelling if i consider his filmography briefly i liked his debut before sunrise it was a warm nice romance film even if it didnt meet my expectations fully i met a different film than the film in my mind however i called before sunset a masterpiece it was my movie unfortunately before midnight was a mind numbing experience for me because there was nothing but dialogs no cinema no art no drama we rather listened a story than watching a movie people talk talk and talk but mostly empty conversations not something which pushes audiences to think finally yesterday i saw boyhood and it was not a tiresome journey like before midnight thank goodness but again there was only a story without any background or even subtext if the message was life is empty then i swallow my words but i dont think so the movie consists of the daily routines of a boy and his family but the movie has not any real theme or has not anything to say to us i mean it has not come to any point other than very basic and naive things mr linklater cant catch even remarkable snapshots as he cant create remarkable moments during this almost three hours long movie i appreciate the movie only for its shooting technique which is a milestone for sure and it requires great devotion and great labor in the movie there are ceremonies cerebrations diners etc but there is no depth at all no point and of course no art the boys inner world his feelings his thoughts his soul none of those is showed or reflected by the director which is really pathetic the director never lets us deduce something this is not a growing up story this is not a movie about puberty crisis so what is the point? and the other main problem of the movie is that the boy including his family dont face with a real crisis or trouble or a problem and i know why because the director is too optimistic about life for example the biggest challenge in the boys life is presented as having a falling out with his girlfriend or moving out the boys sister supposedly stands for the flighty girls of today but it goes nowhere we are expected to feel sorry for the family when they have financial difficulty but personally i didnt because in the following scene we watch that the mother gives a splendid thanksgiving dinner to a bunch of people i think mr linklater hasnt seen bicycle thieves yet because otherwise he would have known struggling for life and being a kid in a world full of trouble this should have been a depressing movie in fact commonly it is said that this is a depressing movie but i believe just the opposite i had expected a depressing and realistic movie from boyhood as i had expected a moving and beautiful art film from before midnight or as i had expected seeing hardships of love relationships from before sunrise and dont expect an intense finale i did because life is bittersweetfirst this movie is a remake of an old series and secondly it has tom cruise in it tom cruise is not a bad actor it just annoys me that movie is focused completely around him as if he were god no wonder the germans hated this movie anyway i will give away the plot in this movie because i feel that you really dont need to see it the only reason i taped it and watched it was because jean reno was in it and he is quite a good actor tom cruise is ethan hunt the member of the imf team that performs impossible missions during a routine mission everything goes wrong and only hunt and the wife of jim phelps the leader of the team escape the american government believe that hunt is behind it and is a mole selling out to the enemy so order him arrested but he manages to slip through their fingers and even breaks into cia headquarters at langley virginia it ends up that jim phelps is the mole and that jean reno is the agent who is in it for the money the movie ends in a scene in the english channel tunnel where reno flies a helicopter through it and hunt tackles phelps on the back of a train this movie follows the theme of the end of the cold war and thus the intelligence agencies are no longer needed this is not an action packed movie but tries to follow the tenseness of the original series it is more about people trying to get into places which are very difficult to get into it as such it follows the style of sneakers which i believe is a far superior moviefirst the good kenneth branagh does it again diversity in hollywood i loved seeing all of the people of non white heritage spattered about the landscape as if they all belonged there coodles to mr branagh for always thinking outside the white box now the bad the movie itself this was the most boring thing i ever sat through and i think that everyone in the small audience i was in on discount day thought the same anytime people leave a theater without saying a word its bad the dialog was the worst ive ever heard lily james is also the worst actress ive ever seen the saving grace was derek jacobi as the king his relationship with his son was far more interesting than cinderellas relationship with her entire family then there was the endless narration doesnt branagh know that the first rule of storytelling is show me dont tell me i guess he forgot in this film the landscapes were pretty but i got tired of the endless stream of colorful gowns that were way too big on the bottom then there was the endless message of the film yes its a good message but a good message doesnt make up for a bad film as i quoted skip this and see ever after is was so much better at telling the cinderella storyfilm adaptations of beloved tv shows are a dime a dozen and it is not hard to determine the diamonds the untouchables the fugitive charlies angels from the lumps of coal pretty much everything else given that brian depalma is the guiding force behind the untouchables and the very structure of the tv show mission impossible opens many avenues that one could explore with a large budget a talented cast and the big screen one certainly can be forgiven for keeping an open mind unfortunately the end result is roughly 12 large scale action sequences surrounded by pure tedium there is a lot of blame to go around for the end result which burned up the box office and inspired two sequels so far but rarely if ever gets a mention on anyones lists of favorite summer blockbusters first the storyline and characters are thoroughly uninteresting for some reason known only to the screenwriters the focal character is someone completely new while the jim phelps character who led the tv series is shunted into support the film allows absolutely no time to get a feel for the imf team and how they work as our initial introduction to them is during a mission that turns into a disaster leaving the majority of the team dead due to an obvious traitor naturally the powers that be assume the traitor is the lone survivor tom cruise but we subsequently learn that another team member survived the melee emmanuelle beart so the two go on the run to steal a list of covert agents from the government to draw out a spy kingpin who they hope will force the hand of the traitor and expose himher or some such thing like the tv show there are a few twists and turns doublecrosses and reversals unlike the tv show none of them are particularly surprising or involving the cast looks better on paper than its plays out on screen kristin scottthomas and emilio estevez are in the film for barely more than an eye blink before being dispatched lead cruise is certainly up to the physical challenges of the role but gives us no good reason to root for his character he spends much of the film either blankfaced or glowering beart as his cohort and potential love interest is lovely but listless jon voight takes on the jim phelps role and pretty much contributes the same dull autopilot performance that he has reserved for his roles in popular entertainment for the last 20 years jean reno is wasted as a later addition to cruises team while ving rhames gets fed what few good lines there are and attempts to appear intimidating henry czerny trots out a slightly starchier version of the uptight government official that he played in clear and present danger meanwhile more discerning viewers wait for the fartoobrief appearances of vanessa redgrave who manages without breaking a sweat to make her fellow cast members appear laughable by comparison depalma once known for some incredible set pieces provides the film with stillborn pacing he ratchets up the adrenaline in the final act in and on top of a speeding train but prior to that we get one mildly amusing set piece with cruise attempting a theft while suspended above the floor in a government building unfortunately the scene goes on and on and on and on ultimately losing whatever suspense and originality it may have initially possessed these elements all culminate in a promising concept that misses its potentialeven though this movie had plenty of expensive glitter an excess of onscreen whispering coupled with an excess of flashbacks rendered the plot next to impossible to figure out but then again maybe that was the producers point to get us to return again and again until we have it all sorted out therefore i also give it 1 pointeven though it suppose to be based on the 1966 tv series anyone who has followed or really liked the television show will be disappointed because it doesnt have 4 guys but 1 as though the creators of this movie version has decided to interwine james bond solo idea into it so all you see throughout the movie is tom cruise being in the highlighted so much that you get the impression that maybe they should of made top gun 1996 movie instead i dont like when movie creators dont honor and adhere to original tv or movie concepts as it seems spitefully disrespectful as if they are saying i have a better idea i wont see anymore mission impossible movies as a result of this its like the green hornet 2011 movie that ruins a good concept by hijacking it totally somewhere elseengland is alternate universe america no further proof than this movie the kingspeople british people dress like americans they just talk funny and use a class system this movie is about the british class system and how even poor people are worthy to become pawns in some meaningless struggle between global economies also a lady offers analsex as an incentive for her rescue from imprisonment cause thats what women so often do in real life there are so many other choices to offer than anal sex right off the bat a handjob a blowjob just regular old vaginal sex when did vaginal sex become not good enough? is this a new thing? i mean you are just giving away the keys to the kingdom to like the first dude that comes along does that sound prudent to you? more entertaining than the following movies sleepers divine secrets of the yaya sisterhood for the love of the game chicagoego centered and senseless movie brian depalma pulls off one cool scene involving an exploding restaurant otherwise a box office success that will be baffling to people who watch it once the tom cruise star has faded if you love tom and he can deserve your love just doesnt this time youll like the fact that for a team movie there is no team its all just tom thats fine if you dont remember the original concept of the cool tv show and lets face it the makers of the film were betting you dont best moment however is when they briefly play the original theme music in a couple of spots dangling wire scene is a steal fro topkakiwhich for depalma is a signature moment what can you say about a career that has lasted for decades where his signature is stealing other directors signature moments here though he really gets to do very little he certainly was taking the job hoping and getting a hit film so he could go off to make his more personal hitchcock rip off films  dont get me stated anyway he doesnt get to work much style into mission final sequence on the train in the tunnel is the first of many abusive unconvincing cgi action scenes that have followed and dominated american movie making i dont mean to get on a soapbox here this film is bad as a stand alone without trying to blame it for other bad films cruise is too into being serious to enjoy the film and the script written and rewritten while they were shooting doesnt not hold together leaving cruise looking rather silly for playing it so seriously rather than with a isnt this fun? dont take it too seriously attitude that might have saved at least him the film was a hit feel free not to listen to me or feel free to actually watch this film as a film and see how poor it is for those who see brian depalmas cinematic stealings from other films as being his expression of style this time around he most effectively steals the hanging on wires gag from topkaki unfortunately he needed to steal some scenes from about 10 other good movies to help out the rest of this one most exciting moment in the film is when they briefly play the original theme musicthat moment leads into the topkaki riff if you were on a desert island and only had this film and its sequel to watch id say watch this one otherwise use them both to burn to make black smoke to attract rescuedr will caster johnny depp develops a sentient computer device with unsurpassed processing power when fatally poisoned by a radical technoterrorist organisation he and his wife rebecca hall upload his consciousness into his invention to preserve his life but the now unrestrained supercomputer soon develops a frightening ambition that blurs the line between humanity and technology it seems that every few years somebody in hollywood tries to redo the lawnmower man which is by no means a perfect movie especially with its laughable early generation cgi but it harbours an interesting premise what happens if we ignore our own judgement and let our technology get the better of us? its an old scifi trope going back decades that has definitely become a crutch of story telling to some extent but any good idea is worth exploring again and with such an impressive cast and a very promising production team behind it hopes were high for transcendence to be a good movie unfortunately though it isnt transcendence is a turgid lifeless bore of a film that doesnt really offer anything insightful about its subject matter because its so single mindedly stupid about it all the parts about technology philosophy and what it means to be human are all thrown to the wayside and the movie instead grounds most of its logic on the relationship between two people like its the most important thing in this world in a movie where technology is used to heal the sick rebuild the forests and even cure death all the movie wants us to care about is how rebecca hall cannot possibly go on living without her dead husband and how all that amazing wonderful miraclemaking doesnt mean anything im not even sure who the main character is supposed to be depp is in the movie in the flesh only for about 15 minutes and after that he disappears mostly into the background of scenes as a computer program making it hard to relate to him hall acts so selfish stupid and blunt throughout that its impossible to like her as an audience member it certainly isnt paul bettany either hes a prisoner through most of the film and when hes not the things that are happening are more or less out of his control also the vagueness of the films antagonist is a real problem were led to believe that computeriseddepp is the main antagonist but hes not really a computer operating by logic is hard to hate as a viewer because its just doing whats in its own nature and many of the miracles its capable of are not in and of themselves evil either since when was healing the blind considered unjust? it certainly isnt the technoterrorist group rift either their motivations as terrorists isnt even particularly clear other than technology is bad shooting johnny depp over a hypothesis seems more like stupidity than martyrdom also during the films climax they become good guys johnny depp was reportedly paid $20 million for his role in this movie and in my opinion he didnt earn his salary he is stiff lifeless bored thats even before he gets uploaded into a computer and obviously uninterested in the finished product rebecca hall is trying very hard here but the terrible writing of her character hamstring her efforts paul bettany is good here and is probably the films strongest asset but hes not in the film enough and pretty much useless by the time the conclusion comes morgan freeman and cillian murphy are just there they dont really have anything interesting to say or do kate mara gives by far the worst performance the bad writing of her character hurts her more than others but she was impossible to buy as the stern serious leader of an organised terrorist group theres also a huge lack of understanding of rudimentary film making skills at play wally pfister is a gifted cinematographer and the film does look good generally speaking but working cinematography on a movie and directing an entire movie are two completely different ball games many aspects of filmmaking are botched here framing blocking dynamics between characters editing camera movements but especially pacing this is one of the worst paced movies in quite some time nothing that happens in the story has any momentum and this coupled with the poor direction over everything else makes the whole movie completely dull to watch the biggest mistake is that film begins with the ending spoiling any and all tension during the movie im not saying that every movie needs to have an action scene either there isnt a car chase during 12 angry men but transcendence builds to a huge final engagement and when it comes its over with way too quickly its a combination of many elements that could go wrong with a movie and its easy to blame wally pfister for the poor direction but i think this movie represents a far bigger concern johnny depp is currently the highest paid actor in the world but this and some of his last films the lone ranger and dark shadows both had disappointing box office takings which leads me to believe that maybe depps day are numbered andor perhaps were entering a new age of movies where it doesnt matter who you cast a stinkers a stinker and people wont flock to see garbagedont waste your time watching this film every interesting idea about the movie is thrown out the window half way through i found fascinating the parallel story thats being told between the main character and his daughter at some point nolan no longer cares for this so he decides to use time however he pleases the film is a huge contradiction and the way it is solved is just confusing and pretending to be more complex than it actually is they are on a mission thats more important than any personal issue man kinds future depends solely on the success of it but f©k that in this kind of hollywood bullshit protagonists cant die just because test audiences dont like that it makes them really really sad so against all odds mcconaughey makes it back home hooray for him and for all the idiots who need this kind of ending mark my words by the time matt damon appears you will be compelled to kick christopher nolan right in the balls i read that they were advised by physicist in order to be scientifically accurate im sure every accurate idea came from other films like 2001 event horizon etc interstellar is a cash grab if you spent your money on this be sure to check on your butt hole christopher nolan might have already had his way with you my asshole is intact because i torrented this bad boy suck on that film industrydont waste your time watching this film every interesting idea about the movie is thrown out the window half way through i found

that film industrydont waste your time and money very bad acting very boring and predictable it just makes no sense i will never ever trust the ratings again ha first hour of the film is so stupid that it is funny faces that actors make unprofessional acting make the movie very very boring what else can i say i wish i stayed home with my husband ben affleck acts like it is his first movie he looks lost looks like he almost forgets the words family members also look and act like people that were taken from the street occasionally all that people look like they have no idea what is the film about im trying to understand how could this goofy movie get those ratings and i guess the answer is money because this is really really low leveldont waste your money too long wanders too much  c script with b actor i felt like i aged 50 years watching this garbage now i know why matthew is doing lincoln commercials he screwed up so many movies and this is what is left his only other worse movie was dumb oops i mean mud  what is this guy thinking whoever wrote this script must have been higher than robert plant in the 70s i cant believe matt damon jumped in probably for beer money matt datmon was the only one worth watching wait until someone hands you the dvd for your library otherwise dont spend a dime on this junk michael caine was in it for the beer money as welldont waste any of your precious time watching this terrible boring and dull film the acting was simply harrowing to watch anne hathaway was as always akin to balsa wood and completely implausible the woman just cant act the film rumbles along for an hour before anything happens by which time you dont really care and you are probably very bored the plot and i use the term loosely is ridiculous and there is more tension in a broken elastic band by watching this i feel like i traded brain cells for jellybeans i must comment on the special effects which i was led to believe were good they were not the script has more holes than a sieve especially when it comes to the scientific theories related to space travel please please dont watch this trashdont fool yourself its just bad dont watch it you may thank me for this advice i wanted to keep this comment short because i dont want to spend more time of my life for this movie almost three hours was enough on the other side the movie made me feel better about myself in some way i mean some people spent 12 years making this what a waste this was refreshing because they lost more of their life than me this long production time doesnt show itself in the quality i had some feeling that the cinematographers wanted to work against quality they used the style of bad propaganda movies typical suburban shots where you expect that someone jumps out of a bush selling m*th to the children of course it would be explained too why it is bad like everything else in this movie they put the words in your mouth leaving nothing for the imagination i dont even mention that the main character is not special at all even more boring than an average person oh and he makes bad quality photos too in this bad quality movie living the life of an artist in a movie which never heard of art and he leaves his picture in the developer for waaay to long listening to the schematic monologue of his teacher instead you will find all kinds of schemes and clichs in this piece of modern film history as they call it in this movie which doesnt dare to state anything the whole movie was like a 3 hours long idk showing alcohol like a gateway to becoming whitetrash is promarijuana i guess but only daring to show it for a split of a second i watched every second of this movie just to see how are they going to come out of this pit? with a highly unrealistic chick acting like a dateraper sitting with our high placebomescaline main character in the sunset repeating the concept of this film i dont knowdont fool yourself its just bad dont watch it you may thank

acting like a dateraper sitting with our high placebomescaline main character in the sunset repeating the concept of this film i dont knowdoes highly paid cast means good movie? the high rating of this movie represents the biased minds of reviewers towards famous cast it certainly does not deserve 72 rating twilight series which i really hated was better than this this movie is a piece of epic failure and is undoubtedly one of worst movies of this years to date there was no such thing even close to what we call good acting the movie was unable to develop any interest during whole of its running time i kept guessing there might be some twist or action coming up because of the high ratings but i was left with an anger that i wasted my time it is clear to me now that angelina jolie lacks voice talent she does not have any face expressions and most of her movies are overrated 2 stars for a slightly better graphics movie lovers avoid it not recommended to anybodydo not believe the reviews this does not come close to an all time great movie i really question someone that gives this movie a good review its completely too long and filled with holes in noway does it come close to connecting any dots the only reason i went to see this movie is because of the 91 rating at the time but my first instinct was correct this movie is not worth watching ever maybe if they shaved 1 hour off but as is stay away after watching this movie i felt compelled to open an imdb account and review my first movie ever because of these reviews that are complete nonsensedid i see the same movie that many other people gave a ten vote?? probably not the movie doesnt give any logic explanation to anything everything in the movie is treated in the most superficial possible way to not get completely disappointed all through the movie you would need to switch off your brain completely otherwise you wont get any answers to the questions that necessarily come to your mind also great actors like matthew mcconaughey are acting awfully probably realizing they are acting in a dumb movie all the director is trying to do is excite the audience with the soundtrack and special effects probably realizing himself how poor the plot is how could so many good actors accept to work in such a poor movie? and how come so many critics are writing that this is a great movie? i would really like to know what great directors like scorsese di palma herzog spielberg would think about this movie in two words absolutely disappointingdespite the hype i went to see interstellar hoping for the best from the dreadful opening which went on forever featuring insipid dialogue and portentous acting by all involved to the crude miniatures in space clearly an homage to kubricks 2001 a space odyssey which accomplished far more with far less technical advantages than todays filmmakers the movie incredibly got worse and worse until the last 30 minutes with some inspired redemptive spacetime scenes but oh that insipid dialogue and mcconaughys western drawl and baleful looks echoed by a truly wasted anne hathaway who also walked through her lines the real culprit is the editing as if nolan was so in love with his work he could not bear to cut a scene and the music? so banal that it managed to be predictable and intrusive at the same time i couldnt wait for the space scenes to begin but from liftoff to deep space they could have nasa footage instead i just cant imagine how anyone could call the space scenes thrilling or the twists and turns of the plot gripping whether or not you liked gravity at least its space scenes were in your face and hardedged watching the interstellar space station cartwheel through space like a miniature toy out of a cracker jacks box was simply embarrassing the scene of mcconaughy and hathaway begging mat damon not to activate the airlock because it wasnt sealed was just another example of nolan trying to manufacture excitement instead of being a hoped for surprise the result was not only something we have seen in many scifi space movies but as an experienced astronaut and pilot damons character would absolutely know would happen there were so many wooden moments its hard to count the best was when mcconaughy walks into his sisters hospital room and the reaction from her friends and family is absolutely zero not even a cocked head what a colossal waste of time talent and money to create something so utterly unforgettable you just cant create a profound movie by hoping characters can talk their way through it nolan may have had a good story in his head but what a messconfused poorly plotted no editing and a visual treatment and color palette that looks like it was done by amateurs 1 out of 10 and thats being kinddespite as far as i recall the first movie being pretty good insurgent just betrays everything that happened at the end with an unsatisfying explanation of why the villain is still in power the movie contains plot twists that a five year old could have predicted and is generally lackluster in its dialog with a weak plot boring characters and a total disregard for all character development from the first movie this was an extreme disappointment for me i will admit there were some good scenes but a diamond smothered in cow manure isnt very attractive the bottom line is that i didnt connect with any of the characters i dont know if this is the case but it seemed like they were trying to fit a lot of things from the book in that didnt belong the plot jumped all over the place without getting to know the characters in the plot or subplots i just got out of the movie and i can only remember three of the characters namesdear santa could you please please please arrange to make it possible that i never have to sit through another execrable pile of utter garbage that has become the standard level of effluvium nolan seems to regularly pitch out all dressed up in its sparkly emperors new clothes? memento was astonishingly brilliant on a budget of several shillings insomnia likewise batman begins was a welcome reinvigoration of a franchise which had previously become something to ridicule and then came the seriously big budgets which exponentially reduced the credibility of any plot or story and here we are at a new cinematic low which worryingly garners this level of praise presumably because it has big special effects empty shallow bombastic unengaging risible crap ohand a new train set would be tops thanksconvoluted dialogue wooden performances and a surprise to see zoe saldana and particularly glenn close in such dross i can only surmise they needed the moneyno character development to speak of except for that of the raccoon that cgid fellow actually showed more acting chops and skill than any of the human cast im a huge fan of marvel and its always a shame to see a thing done badly there was no energy the pace was laboured staggered it just lacked rhythm as a side note the rating this film has received is a travesty i must assume people are not watching movies they are rating i understand everyones tastes are different but really 8 stars i wouldnt by the dvd wait until it hits terrestrial if you must see it but definitely dont pay good money to view this filmcons i hated how the actor for cinderella looked her eyebrows bothered me throughout the whole movieshe wasnt a true blond had a fat jaw small eyes larger nose and bluntly just not gorgeous cinderella was supposed to be pretty with all small facial features except for big blue eyes her eyes were not even bluetheres plenty of beautiful blonde actors like amanda seyfried amber laura heardanna sophia robbchloÇ grace moretzindiana rose evansand her not having her hair in a bun with earing and gloves really just helped destroy the whole cinderella look the step sisters were supposed to be overweight and ugly but both were skinny and one pretty the child cinderella had buck teeth and a big nose and forehead too and wasnt too pretty either theres the step mom didnt seem so evil more hurt and greedy but not consistent with either the movie wasnt too exciting or dramatizedpros the change in how she got her name was great her being couragous and kind was good the men that actually looked like a goose and lizards was great the carriage blue dress and glass slipper was magical the price was perfectthe real mom was perfect and beautiful the acting from most actors was goodthe moral of the story was better and last but not least disney make a movie with a hispanic girl theres mostly white princess and only a few non white that are never displayed on shirts and etc except for the occasional black princess to shut people upcons i hated how the actor for cinderella looked

slick and all steedshinybut this film poached from kill bill the saint inception the avengers any 60s bond etcwith added clockwork orange violence simply shows that matthew vaughn is just another vile tarantino wannabee handed a big budget and excessively indulgently produced a stupid film with set pieces of boring ugly violence some scenes as in the church are just disgusting and from that point the interest level wanes the scenes in the mountain lair are inception meets on her majestys secret service with absurd and endless killing which ultimately made me feel ill 30 minutes too long and from a clown copycat director this film is great initially for 60 minutes and then irritating and vile for 70 minutes yes the damn thing runs 130 minutes i really did feel sick and exhausted when it finished i thought it all a shocking waste of production money time and the studios trust to show contempt for the audience with such cretinous perverse action and result the villain even spews on the audience then there is the hilarious anal sex joke the last 70 minutes of this chrome dildo of a movie are truly horriblecinema visitors seeing the good rating and reviews on imdb beware i am a big fan of fantasy movies but first of all the 16+ rating is not truly understandable for me its a children and family movie and so i have to confess i may be to hard on the movie because i went in there with to high expectations the look may be good and the vfx are also high quality production but the story just lacks on depth the idea to show the beginning of evil and the fairy tale world from another point of view is good but the script and the acting was really bad imo angelina could have done better and some very flat character drawings and dialogs let me roll my eyes unconsciously the movie had some funny moments though but they are rare and for this idea there should have been more time for preproduction sometimes and most of all in the beginning it seems like a fastforward story where every important story point is just streaked with the cautiousness of a metal glove its what i would call a sunday afternoon movie where you can lay on the couch and just let it pass but its nothing what really attracted me for my 3 female friends it was entertaining but they also told me that it was nothing special and they would not really recommend it to other friends they just described it as a nice if there are no expectations and you want to make your 4 to 12 year old child happy with a nice movie you should sit in there seeing angelina in the role was interesting but now i know its not her kind of genrecinderella is the worst movie and a clich_ remake by walt disney studios are walt disney so desperate to rip off and copy all cinderella movie scenes and to make a very bad copy i saw the previous cinderella movies especially the original cinderella movie they were too much better and well done than this stolen and pirated copy movie why would the producers of walt disney studios make a very boring film which even kids might hate because of the absence of creativity to be honest and to tell the truth i regret seeing this film because it is only made for babies to fool them avoid this movie and watch the original first copy because it is superiorwhile this pirated and rip off movie is so inferior if not the worst movie ever madecinderella is the

original first copy because it is superiorwhile this pirated and rip off movie is so inferior if not the worst movie ever madechildish presentation boring in parts very silly overall noisy irritating soundtrack unnecessarily long scenes strange direction techniques very few real thrills a lot of hype  and i never realized what an enormous nose tom cruise has maybe thats why one of the female leads also has a giant schnozzle the film was a gross disappointment though i guess diehard cruise fans will eat it up any comparison between this effort and the tv series is virtually pointless as the tv shows were fast exciting clever superblydirected full of suspense with a lot of sharp dialogue and actors who were true craftsmen sorry but this flick is a real bummercan i have the 25 hours of my life back? there is no closure to this movie they ruined it with the ending imho what were the producers and directors thinking a long and very drawn out movie and then to get to the end and leaving the audience hanging it reminds me of one the lord of the rings movies where they just suddenly and abruptly end the movie except this one is much worse since there will be no sequel my wife and i had a debate whether the wife was attractive or not i thought so at the beginning of the movie and not so much later my wife thought that she was not attractive at all i hope this review is beneficial and will save someone time and moneybrian de palma has just ruined the originality of mission impossible jim phelps a traitor? seriously tom cruise is destroying one of the greatest imf secret agents now tell me jim has been a wonderful successful spy and a real handsome one at that and youre going to tell me a dumbass like ethan hunttom cruise is going to trick him? someone is trying to kill off the original mission feeling and replacing it with thick hollywood effects lightweight conceited actors like tom cruise and girls with fake boobs too reminiscent of james bond or any other typical hollywood wannabe spy film im so glad peter graves and most of the original actors didnt get themselves involved with this depressing movie the movie desperately tried to replace the characters with new ones but i dont think you can ever replace jim phelps with tom loser cruise or barney or paris or anybody i never liked tom cruise anyways the original tv shows were much better than these new movies vasically because they were intricately plotted had lots of wit and barely had these huge unnecessary explosion scenes which the new movies have so much of i think the only reason why this new piece of crap remake of mission impossible was made by idiots for idiots if you have watched the old 1960s mission impossible and liked it you may not like these movie remakes they are nothing compared to the intellect and intricate planning of the original and if youre a jim phelpspeter graves addict like me youll hate the movie even moreboyhood this is richard linklaters much talked about film that was actually shot over the course of twelve years chronicling the growth of his characters now let me get something straight before i proceed my reviews are always based upon the finished product what is presented on screen i dont concern myself with what happened behind the scenes what got left on the cutting room floor or how the film was made i concern myself with the balance of style substance and execution now with that in mind let i remind you that this is a work of fiction written by linklater himself not a documentary chronicling the growth of actual people but rather the growth of the characters he wrote had this been a documentary i might have allowed myself to be blindsided just a bit in which manner the film was made but its not a documentary so i will completely disregard the manner in which the film was made that sort of thing does not play a part in my review so what do we have left? honestly not that much two hours and forty five minutes of filler lightly sprinkled with brief moments of conflict with no resolution therefore no character growth i mean this is a film about boyhood or at least one can assume that much given the films title but i will go on a little further to say this is a film chronicling a boys ascension into manhood a lot can happen during that time in fact a lot does happen during that period in ones life which all goes into the molding of the person who you will eventually be unfortunately it seems that were just outsiders looking in youd think that a film about one of the most tumultuous times in ones life would be a roller coaster ride of emotions but what we have is a film thats nearly three hours long devoid of any emotions no life lessons learned by the main characters no emotional growth period what the hell did i just watch? if the characters didnt learn anything then they didnt grow emotionally if they didnt grow emotionally then i have a hard time connecting to the characters on an emotional level sure we can all relate to adolescence but dont let that fool you into thinking that you know these particular characters know why they are the way they are know what drives and motivates their actions and behavior by the end of the film ive watched these human beings grow up physically rather than to grow into beings of consciousness and emotions that make them humanboyhood is truly an amazing film terrible awkward cringeinducing dialogue boring uninspired cinematografy awful poorly written characters no story to keep you interested also dont forget that the movies really long too it almost feels twice the 12 years lets be serious here they are saying the movies revolutionary it took twelve years to make but if you think about it harry potter franchise is same kind of thing as this film except with actual characters and plot but really some people dare to call this movie a masterpiece? hmm i think i will release my childhood movies they were recorded in span of 12 years im pretty sure ill get an oscar in the conclusion spare yourself your sanity and dont watch this film im pretty sure that once you get outside of the cinema you will feel 12 years older i got gray because of that movieboring boring boring boring i wish i could fill up this review with just that one word but imdb wont let me how can anyone sit through 2 34 hours of watching someones boring life roll by? what a waste of film  or is it all video tape now? i dont care how long a film took to make how the actors aged over the course of the film or anything else i want a film to tell a story and this is more like watching someones boring life as they grow up so what? who wants to watch that? what is it with all these people who think that is marvelous they really must have incredibly boring lives to think that this film is even the remotest bit interesting this film is almost as bad as birdman which i watched completely thinking that at some point something interesting must happen but it didnt just some artyfarty long camera shots whoopdeedoo and this one was filmed over 12 years? whoopdeedoobetter than woos sterile sequel but has the unmistakable stamp of de palmas illogic except this time it isnt so much illogic as total confusion for the viewer the plot twists and the conspiracy haze go quite far and it isnt long after one gives up in trying to understand who is doing what to whom for what reason the movie isnt boring ill give it that de palmas films are rarely boring however there is also a casting problem rhames  of all people  plays a computer expert a hacker no less this is absolutely ridiculous then we have the old and nearly fat jon voight karatechopping the young james bondtype tom cruise character even more absurd voights wife is emmanuelle beart these two are as convincing a pair as bob dole and britney spears would be the action sequences with the helicopter are wooesquire cruise blows up the chopper and the explosion throws him  unharmed  onto the train which is going at around 200 kmh and then a part of the chopper fails to impale him by a mere millimeter these scenes were truly prophetic because woo  the king of absurdist action scenes  took over in the sequel beart comes complete with a set of fake breasts and an upper lip so pumped up with silicone or whatever it is they inject there that her mouth is perpetually pursed to kiss someonebeing a fan of disneys 1959 sleeping beauty i was excited for maleficent one of disneys most iconic villains to be brought to life in live action however after seeing the film i am utterly disappointedin the film maleficent the classic story of sleeping beauty is butchered the film by itself is not a bad film the visuals are great and angelina jolie actually resembles maleficent this film though ignores the already established tale of sleeping beauty and makes up a new one while watching this film i was pleased with the initial backstory created for maleficenthowever this backstory pins stefan as the actual villain and maleficent as the a victimin this backstory stefan removes maleficents wings in order to be the next king this change was one i was at first willing to tolerate however maleficent interacts with aurora from the time that she is a newborn all the way up to her teens maleficent becomes so close with aurora that aurora begins to call her a fairy godmother this destroys maleficents character maleficent is supposed to be cruel and evil but this film makes her out to be a loving motherly figure things only get worse from there prince phillip is a practically useless character in this film he appears to be a naive and unintelligent teenager instead of the powerful prince he is supposed to be then adding to the uselessness of phillips character when aurora is in her deathlike sleep phillips kiss does not wake her up it is maleficents kiss that wakes her up i find this change to be completely unacceptable maleificent is supposed to hate aurora and phillip is supposed to fight epically to save aurora then once aurora is awake again she teams up with maleficent to escape from stefans castle in doing so aurora finds maleficents wings which are still flapping she gives them to maleficent who basically becomes indestructible this sequence is so departed from the sleeping beauty story that it seems like it contains all new characters instead of the already established maleficent an aurora my biggest complaint is about the dragon maleficent does not turn into a dragon there is a dragon but it is not maleficent and it is easily overpowered by stefans soldiers phillip is not involved with he dragon at all the dragon in the 1959 sleeping beauty is one of the most iconic scenes in all of disney history and the fact that they removed that scene is appalling to me maleficent completely ignores the context set by sleeping beauty and twists it into a lesser versionbecause of all the positive hype i hoped for at least a good film im left wondering what it is i just dont get so many good reviews? even mark kermode says the young actor in the film has screen presence and i think wtf hes playing a boring so and so  hes not supposed to have presence im not sure if theres enough good stuff here even for 10 minutes  seriously certain things like ethan hawk showing an empty wallet caught my empathy for a moment but not enough to merit sitting through nearly 3 hours of this i just dont understand how it won the golden globe for best film thankfully theres a few negative reviews from likeminded people for me to know ive not gone completely madbasically this film was a cross between 2001 a space odyssey and gravity there wasnt that much to it the one saving grace was nolans inspired depiction of a 5 dimensional space very neat shame about the flimsy plot dodgy character development and poor script oh yes and the clunky ridiculous robots were fun all in all a waste of money nolan should have made a much simpler film something foreign and arty to stick his cool 5 dimensional bookshelf into the rest of the cash he spent on this would probably have done some good somewhere but such is life silly spoiled directors and their silly spoiled foolish vanity trips boringavoid this couple at all costs  they are very toxic gone girl is a misleading title since amy is not a girl she used to be a childhood storybook celebrity named amy but there is nothing girlish like about her in this movie in fact she calls herself the cword david fincher has made some of my favorite movies fight club zodiac etc but this is not one of my favorites this movie is all the things i dislike in a movie  tedious depressing unlikeable characters dark photography moody music strange casting smug dialogue this might work with the girl with the dragon tattoo but come to think of it  that was no girl eitherat the time of watching this movie it had a rating of 84 on imdb i normally trust that whatever movie has an 80 rate or more should definitely be a great film well i hope this is the exception that confirms the rule because this movie might be one of the worst i have ever seen why? you must be wondering because of the last 30 minutes up until that point i was really enjoying it generally speaking but man that ending is appalling utterly atrocious and plainly nonsensical a great thriller turned into a love story of pathetic proportions in a matter of minutes the only positive i found at the end was the way they portray the power of media and public opinion in society the rest should go down the garbage shoot in these types of movies theres only one premise keep it real if you do youll have a great film which will improve with every twist and turn you add if you dont keep it real and your thriller becomes too surrealistic youll find yourself going from cleverness and brilliance to false cleverness and stupidity and thats exactly what happened in this film in the last half hour seriously who in their right mind can believe that sequence of events at the end? it had great potential but it is surely one that i will remember for the wrong reasonsat first i thought this movie is a parody of all the other superhero nerdy clichs and i kept waiting for something funny to happen at some point i started to realize that this movie is for real for real boy meets girl and after trying to kill each other they fall in love the bad guys must work together in order to save the world therefore becoming the good guys they of course defeat the evil all their criminal past is erased they get the universes recognition yada yada yada everyone lives happily ever after this movie couldnt even make me smile terrible acting no emotion no sparkle no nothing if i could i would rate this movie zero starsat first i thought this movie is a parody of all the other superhero nerdy clich_s and i kept waiting for something funny to happen at some point i started to realize that this movie

no sparkle no nothing if i could i would rate this movie zero starsat first i thought i was in a horror movie or a lame lord of the rings type rip off but then this lame movie turned out to be a save the planet preachy flick i give this three stars maimly because of my favorite actress is in it and as always does a great job and that would be imelda staunton other than this i would rate this movie but one star i was looking forward to a fresh interpretation of the bible story instead was treated to this i like well told stories but this should have been returned to the writer and put the money to better use sorry mrs pitt it at least appeared the you were trying thanks but i will not rent this one and waste more money the producers spent a fortune on this and they will get their money back before its all over but they should look at disney classics and even movies that have been churned out after disneys demise at a fraction of the cost and have been very successful from toy story miniseries to the lion king remake there is a strong interest in genuine faith based movies there was nothing genuine about this just empty meaningless hollywood hypeas you can probably ascertain from my title sentence i am not a fan of mr nolan however i dont have any bias prior to watching his films in fact quite the opposite i want to like his films as i really like his ideas and concepts which is why its such a shame he never delivers i also seem to be in a minority with my views as his films seem to have mass appeal certainly if you look at money they make but so far they have all left me cold interstellar tdk and inception all have similar flaws on the positive side they are all really cinematic stylish and well filmed they all have really atmospheric music and nice special effects on the negative side the plots are terrible and make no sense the dialog is flat and unrealistic there is no charisma or charm in the films they are functional and soulless and they lack any real depth or meaning the characters tend to be robotic and cold not warm or humorous the problem is when you put these two elements together you basically get high expectations that something great is going to happen but ultimately nothing does so it becomes a major let down on to interstellar specifically warning spoilers a plenty the first hour of the film was very boring and very silly the earth is running out of food so people still plant huge fields of crops which they destroy when driving through them for no good reason they have completely automated the process of farming crops yet they dont need scientists or engineers they need farmers which makes no sense if the earth was starving then the crop fields would be fenced off taken away from farmers and it would be a controlled process scientists and engineers would be the most valued members of society if the crops were so valuable they wouldnt be exposed to the elements and the dust they would be covered and protected everyone is so worried about the food shortages they dont take any notice of it instead they drive around in huge petrol driven suvs from 2014 wheres the google cars or electric cars? heres an idea you now have the ability to hibernate on spaceships so apply that to the population of earth and reduce the need for food anyway lets move on they go into space arrive at some place and immediately land in some water do they survey the area first check out the planet and landing area first in detail nope they just land now i know there is time pressure but why havent nasa sent numerous robots into space to visit these planets and send back information anyway this drags on a bit they visit another place which is another disaster and then we get to the point of the film only after about 2 and a half hours cooper flies into a black hole where he would normally be crushed and killed instantly but survives in some kind of advanced framework where he very predictably sends the already sent messages back to his daughter after this there is a very silly ending even though he is outside of time as it were and he can send messages to any point he cant for some reason stay in the same time as his daughter and how stupid was the 1970s minecraft designed robot in the end the visuals and atmospheric music was great but the plot soul and charm of the film was completely missing unfortunately like all nolan moviesas you can figure from the summary i am here to bring the rate down because 82 star as i review this was not justified this movie the story revolves around mason for 12 years of his life and as everybody said this movie is using the same cast filming for 12 years i understand the value of this signature but let me remind you this is not a documentary or a story based on true event it is fictional so first priority must come to writing and boy the writing is awful they managed to make a story less interesting than a 12 years story of any regular boys out there mason changing school meeting new friends abused by his step father got a girlfriend morph to an emo he got into photography what could be more mainstream than that? mason have no depth have no motivation mason is a loser with no direction of life and still not projecting any compassion to his mother some drama make you laugh some make you cry some make you think deep about life some make you want to hug your loved one boyhood does not do any of that 82 rating is a trap only movie hipster critics rate this movie high because of the art and gimmick so if you are a normal person who wants a good story and a good time dont watch this this movie is just 3 hours of watching a boy gradually lose his cuteness and acting skill *sorry for my bad englishas the title suggeststhis show is trying much to hard to live up to other titles in the dc universe the dark knight smallville and the also overrated man of steel it is too dark and gritty that it detracts from the overall narrative if the show were a bit more lightheartedthen maybe the arrow would character would be more tolerable as the show continues queens back story just seems more and more contrived and begins to lack purpose the abundance of the flashbacks per episode also gets to be distracting the only character on the show who isnt completely one directional is felicity she lights up any scene shes in and makes the show a bit brighter which i feel it needs more of however those are short lived and quickly dismissed by testosterone filled fight sequences that are difficult to see because again its too dark if the show stopped trying to take itself so seriously like a drama and more like a comic book series then it would a much better and enjoyable showas the summary tells you i found this show after seeing 11 episodes a big disappointment the main characters have absolutely no chemistry with each other and their acting is just terrible in general i found out that after a couple of episodes i thought there was something i missed in the intro he tells us he becomes something else now since i am not a big arrow fan or any comics in general i thought there must have happened something that changed him into something else like with the hulk but no at least not up to this point but more important is that there isnt any indication that they will reveal something like that has happened that is just one small example of how awful the storywriting is in my opinion a show must have got some credibility like in other shows and movies we tend to believe that they can do those extraordinary things but up now they have failed to let me believe anything perhaps it is due to the acting lack of chemistry or the thin storyline but i assume it is because all of those things together the only thing that is actually good about the show are the action scenes but since they failed to let me believe anything those arent good enough to carry the show all in all a terrible show and i dont expect any progress in the near futureas the movie started i was excited to see a character wearing a mask with glowing red eyes i thought the opening scene was promising and then suddenly some nonserious music started to play the main character started to dance and everything went downhill from there after that there was special effect after special effect i love special effects but it did sound like this movie was made only to showcase special effects such as explosions explosions explosions and did i forget to say explosions? the special effects were indeed magnificent but it doesnt take long for you to realize it is all eye candy it is there to help conceal the fact that this is a movie made for ten year old kids to gaze at and go wow for everyone else and by everyone else i mean adults with thinking brains this extremely shallow and childish piece of work would be little more than a showcasing of special effects and cinematic techniques surprise surprise special effects do not make up for a shallow childish and extremely disjointed plot with performances that range from mediocre to downright terrible and they do not make a movie worth a mature persons time i loved the ghost rider thor and the amazing spiderman 2 even the avengers was tolerable but this one was simply a mess designing lots of weird looking characters with unpleasant colors and hair styles is like desperately asking the audience to love the movie just because it has some of the most weird looking characters ever seen in a movie men in black anyone? one of my biggest complaints and what really annoyed me throughout the movie is that while the special effects were great the combination of colors in most of the scenes was really unpleasant remember how thor had great colors in each and every scene? the colors actually went with one another you dont see that here a combination of light blue orange brown grey and a lot of colors that create a really awful combination was present in nearly every scene it was a huge letdown next time they should get a better art director so that they do not annoy the people who understand colors and art in summary this movie is not for adults take your kids to see it though they will definitely love it but since spending so much money only to entertain kids is not really justifiable theyd better stop wasting such huge amounts of money on movies like this and spend it where its really needed fighting ebola to save the human race would be a much better use of such a huge amount of moneyas many have said it is the uneventual life of a person much like the truman show which made fun on the reality tv this basically wants to be the truman show obviously this doesnt really work because you see his 12 years in the 3 hours if they made a tv show about the main character it would have most likely never lasted 12 years but then again people watch all kind of reality tv for me it did nothing and i stopped watching after the first 20 or so minutes and just skipped through until the end people called it life great but i rather watch the goldbergs for that at least it is funny and funny enough being a child of the 80s i can relate to itas almost an oldtimer having enjoyed the original tv series i rushed to the theater to remember some of the old feeling flawed casting an unbalanced script hesitating acting and overthetop special effects made me grind my teeth in anger and close my eyes tight shut in shame the plot the effects the relations the triple treason etc all have a distinct smell of the improbable it has several moments you feel like saying yeah right to the screen to indicate what you see is truly and utterly impossible and as always that kills the movie and thats sadas a fan of marvel movies i was excited to see guardians of the galaxy however this movie failed on several levels it is supposed to a comedy but the jokes are not funny i genuinely laughed once furthermore one joke was weirdly inappropriate the story is completely generic it seems like they just needed some story any story as a vehicle for the characters to get together and try to be funny i wanted to write a review without spoilers but the big setpiece ending of a spaceship crashing into the ground has to be called out this was done in the avengers and star trek into darkness to me its like directors have to have this 911 shot in every movie big thing crashes into buildings and it has to stop its boring now the only positive about this movie was the special effects and space backgrounds it seems that marvel have figured out punters will pay cash money for any old junk if its wrapped up in special effects and a decent soundtrack i will approach the next marvel with extreme caution and i will not see guardians of the galaxy 2any one who read dc comics will tell you green arrow is a poor mans batman so to speak that being said with all the copywrite garbage i am sure it is easier to get rights to make a green arrow show rather than a new batman show this still doesnt excuse how horrible this thing is a friend referred it to me as a great show with the flash in it they dont cover the flash at all really just a short cameo with normal barry allen i would encourage you to watch a daytime soap opera then watch this garbage and tell me the difference the acting is horrible the writing is so awful that it must be done by drunken monkeys they randomly put a villain in the clock tower and arrows crew wonders where he is they should just move their headquarters there if they ask laural one more time is something wrong i will punch my tvand i dont think its me if you want to know specifically whats wrong with this flick look at some of the other 1* reviews its been spelled out in detail what i want to talk about is how this dumb movie has an 8* rating with over 200k people rating it the first thing that comes to mind is what i read about another new release the interview which had a high rating and lots of positive reviews within 24 hours of its release someone pointed out the statistical aberrations of those numbers suggesting imdb was getting bombarded by false accounts with an addenda to deceive for this movie i dont think thats the case so im wondering how so many people can be so uncritical in their thinking well about half the voters in the usa voted to reelect george w bush so that explains a lot for those of you who gave this movie high marks and didnt vote for bushs second term please consider this for the future there are movies where we are presented with a madeup reality from the start like time travel for example or unreal mental states like in tron or the matrix with those you say ok its bs now entertain me but when a movie takes place in the world we know and live in there is a higher standard as the story progresses it must be logical it cant defy gravity it cant do things that are not gunna happen in real life those are the holes in the story in gone girl there are so many holes and those holes are so ridiculous you gotta ask yourself do they think im stupid? i guess the answer is yes i guess they are correct i guess im now a minority the dumbing of america is happeningan 84 are you high? i always thought that there would be a good reason for a movie to last 2 and a half hours i dont see why so many girls my age 16 were so into it after watching gone girl i felt as if i had wasted so much time in which i couldve accomplished something and made myself more useful this movie was a waste of time it was boring long and totally ridiculous i dont see what is feminine about it since there are some totally disgusting scenes that i think some men couldnt bare to watch which of course had nothing to do with the plot fake rape was there really a need for it? was there a need in using seduction to kill your ex? couldnt you just kill him in his sleep? but no i had to be done in a sexual way to make to movie stand out more the sex scenes were totally outrageous disturbing and completely unrealistic and next time you make a movie try and reduce the amount of oral sex no one wants to see someone implying that are having oral sex i dont know what else to say but this movie is just really bad and it annoyed me because i was spending so much time desperate to see it because of the high rating and when i did i felt like i wasted so much time obsessing over nothing they couldve chosen better actors and actresses too i hope i never come across a movie that was this bad every again sorry but this movie was an epic failam i the only one on planet earth who thinks that this film is absolute tosh? perhaps im being unkind because i could only handle an hour before walking out i thought the acting in particular was very poor the storyline is twaddle  a farmer with flight experience finds nasa in an unspecified location with a rocket that is going to save earth  a typecast michael caine thank goodness it wasnt morgan freeman opens the boardroom door and there is the rocket it seemed to me that used actual rocket launch footage? the time element is misused and the special effects are not that great i thought elysium knocked socks off this film i did semi enjoy the water sequence but it was at the point where they get back to the mother ship that i walked  very quickly out of the cinema ps i love matthew mcconaughey in true detective and i cant believe i was looking at the same actoralthough there was an impossible mission in this movie the story has nothing whatsoever to do with the classic tv series in the show a team of under cover specialists created an artificial situation for the benefit of the victims of a sting type operation usually resulting with their enemies turning on each other the imf team in this movie pretty much refers to tom cruise alone with the rest of the team reduced in status to nameless flunkies who just stand around and watch as he single handedly saves the world the tv shows covert stealth premise was tossed out since cruise doesnt emote well enough to convey the tension of committing espionage right under a dangerous enemys nose instead the original format was replaced by cranked up action at an impossible james bond on steroids level with scenes such as the exciting but ridiculously over the top helicoptertrain sequence other actors have woefully limited screen time but act their parts faithfully the original score from the show is utilized well spicing up the action effectively the script is shallow and the entire mole twist bit is concealed as well as is as an elephant hiding behind an ant its also an insanely stupid plot twist which spits on the tv series the impossible mission to make tom an action hero see a james bond flick or a rerun of the original tv series insteadalright odds are youre going to hate this because i didnt really like this movie and im fairly blunt sometimes my extremely detailed summary this is what i get for finally going into a movie blind thinking it has morgan freeman and depp and paul bettany in it so it has to be passable at least right? well the director was very awful and the story was ridiculous its a movie about the singularity and dealing with it and while there are some things in that id like to believe happen someday its not going to happen in this manner here we go basically depp is a brilliant weirdo and married to his soulmate wifeperson they work in genetic computing so depp gets shot by a psycho and is going to die so emotional wifeperson takes the next step and downloads depps brain into the pc system hes been developing and it works the psychos are attacking all over its calamity jim what can we do? we have to hide inside this totally undefended abandoned school from our childhood which happens to be housing this extra copy of the worlds most advanced computer set up system we need that anyone could have just walked up and used  super computer depp needs to be connected to the internet and does get connected for approximately 1 second and is now spreading himself over everything everywhere but it took days to download his brain?  super computer depp does shady stock works to make his wife rich and so then hes going to work towards fixing humanity in some method that computers believe is best so he needs a place to do this he decides and hes smarter than us so this has to be right that this place should be underground under a desert in california right beside this piece of crap hopeless hick town wife will use newfound riches to build it  this might be reasonable except wife hires one redneck hick from the town to build it  redneck hick is successful in a few seconds and *poof* we have this insanely gigantic underground facility full of technical equipment never before seen to man so it didnt actually take a few seconds but in actual movie time it was more like a month  deppbot starts healing people with nanobots and taking over their bodies making them super strong and super smart or restoring vision this seems fine except theyre now brainwashed into a nanozombie state  deppbot decides this is better for everyone starts recruiting more people for miracles  bettany is aware things arent good and teams up with the original psychos including a daenerys clone that shot depp to try and bring him down they hide under copper wire nets and eventually steal the original redneck hick since nanoprogrammed into a superzombie deppbot cant see through copper wire it blocks his wireless signal  bettany helped live depp program the original ai system hes the only one that can stop this  in a few seconds he comes up with a virus that can take down deppbot and injects it into the wife shes going to die but its going to be for the good of humanity  attack plan time the psycho team mounts an assault on depps field of solar energy panels to distract him while wifey goes and is like oh save me lover deppbot or something and gets him all secretly hell never see it coming  using four guys the fake mother of dragons three guns and a 1910 style mortar gun dragged around on by trailer hitch on an elderly chevy van they defeat the evil nanozombie townsfolk despite a large number of shading things happening  bettanys virus is uploaded to all the internets in the entire world infecting everything and shutting the internet off and turning it back to a prestone age state also known as 1986 after all its better than an army of depp clones that use wireless internet to steal people theyre nanobots you know theyre in everything now  humanity is saved yes ***big reveal*** i wont reveal it but what doesnt happen is depp isnt like screw your internet im gonna make my own internet to run my life he made his own new self out of synthetic flesh and whatnot he reincarnated himself as a living breathing deppbot but he apparently cant defeat the lack of 80111ac wireless i can assure you that that did not happen even though his nanobots are in everything moral of the story this movie is impressive in its illogical hilarity which is extremely difficult to describe or attempt to write down i didnt include most of it it might be worth it to watch and make fun of in a sort of count the number of times the wet bandits die in home alone sort of way but otherwise dont we got like 5 minutes of morgan freeman in this one apparently theres only so much morgan freeman to go around and some other movie needed an old black guy i hope you appreciated this summary but odds are youre bugged nowafter seeing this get a good rating i took at shot at watching itright now my faith in humanity has dropped a whole bunch if this is what they think is a good show so in fairness i figured to press on and go into season 2 to see if it was a context thing that would make it better only to find the show went from bad to omg brutally bad in season two how can one listen to a supposed superhero whine for hours on end and not want to throw a rock at the monitor? after a while my eyes glazed over and realized this show is missing a y chromosome really badly the acting is some of the worst ive seen in some time the script writers should be taken to the woodshed and the characters are as thin as one could ever imagine my wife had a great summary of this show she said it was like the green hornet had a child with one the kardashian sisters and gave birth to a green whiney superhero who needs acting lessons however the real villains in this show are the writers and most of the actors shows like this never get cancelled yet the really good one never get a second seasonafter 30 minutes you are still not interested the 30 minute time frame is the cutoff for interest the lines in the movie are so idiotic that a three year old could have written them i think people that wrote good reviews actually were getting paid to do it my wife likes chic flics but this one is so stupid and the dialogue is so stupid that only an idiot could like it the scenes are ridiculous the police in the story are stupid and do not act like police the main character which happens to be ben aflec of should i say aflac is searching for clues that his wife left after she disappeared and how can i say how bad the script is it is for an emotional response from women men do yourself a favor and do not watchactually a good well acted movie till the end ben affleck was excellent and rosamund pike had me 100% convinced she was evil incarnate carrie coon as bens twin sister and kim dickens as the lead detective also gave excellent performances as for the story i can deal with sad endings where the hero dies like braveheart cool hand luke and endless others when the credits came up on gone girl i could only regret spending over 2 hrs to watch a movie that left me that angry i would have preferred she had just killed ben affleck and gotten away with it assuming the book had the same ending i would have thrown it across the room upon finishing it i enjoyed the movie up till the end but that completely ruined it for mea typical nutsandbolts storyline that hollywood is sooooo comfortable with ye ole agent that has outlived his usefulness so its time to retire them permanently practice anyone who has followed the equalizer eye spy or the original series from which this film is based is certainly not unfamiliar with the plot add to this some nifty special effects and gadgetry and youve got a time worn plot with a new wrapping of course throw in the usual percentage of spy idioms too the team does a job then proceeds to get knocked off except for tom cruise toms out there and alone tom desperately tries to contact the company tom is scared tom forgot his dental floss see tom run tom cant even manage a goofy smile they try to kill tom toms having a bad hair day what happens for the rest of this flick is a whirlwind of incredible improbability and a seething lack of tension inbetween muffled protests of no way and the physical sense of my eyelids getting heavy mission impossible is about as suspenseful as watching a plumber unclog a drain ms redgraves performance is little more than a cameo which is a true waste of a gifted actress in summation when the best thing you can say about a motion picture is that the peppy theme song recycled from the tv series still sounds good its time to fold the tenta tired theme and plot nothing to see here overall the plot has a political agenda aimed at america in spite of the fake british accents ugly inglorious scenery abounds from the beginning dont take your children to see this movie or rent it renting the movie or paying to see it because it has angelina jolie in it is the same as having voted for obama because he was black great movies are cast with unknowns so predictable casting spells turning people into the proverbial newt royal birth and associated spell choir voices in spite of zero spirituality with associated special fx in the fairycolor spectrum the political slant is in the plot where maleficent defends the moors a biome in europe from humans i banish humans from the moors foevah she says the common belief today among the confused is that humans have ruined mother earth and do not belong here my daughters and i have watched nearly every disney movie in the last 20 years and this is the worsta simple farm guy named copper matthew mcconaughey and a few other experts go into outer space to explore other worlds that might sustain human life it seems that that life on earth might not survive due to to some unexplained environmental disaster naturally nothing goes right way overpraised and terrible scifi movie when i heard the plot from this i expected the worst writerdirector christopher nolan has never been a favorite for mei hate what he did to batman in his movie trilogy i thought that he as trying to imitate stanley kubrick 2001 here but its far worsehes doing steven spielberg the movie runs way too long 165 minutes and theyre constantly pushing family friendly values in your face coopers nonstop yammering about his daughter got on my nerves instantly also that stupid fake southern accent he adopts is immediately annoying the story is very slow and all the characters are cardboard cutouts youve seen in other movies the special effects are flawless and theres some beautiful cinematography here but the extreme length and boring story really weigh it down any sort of statement theyre trying to make on time and life is completely deadened by the script also this movie is very manipulative and way too sentimental they go out of their way to make the audience crylike at a spielberg movie well i did crytears of joy at the end that this was over also the gaps in logic and plot holes here are very annoying i lost track of how many times i rolled my eyes at the dubious logic served up here the acting was as good as it could be i guess but at the end they throw in a surprise guest star who i wont name it didnt help because i think hes a terrible actor and this didnt change my mind i was bored and looked at my watch many times while this played its boring obvious and manipulative why is this getting so much praise? skip ita not so unique mind thats responsible for polluting the world of cinema with an abomination that is the before trilogy strikes again by filming 2 child actors

of a threshold of acceptability finding ourselves not unlike frogs in a pan being brought to a slow imperceptible boil christopher nolan and some of his cast are telling the press that interstellar is a love story i will take them at their word and assume that whatever else i picked up on was left there unwittingly for the rest of us to parse through considering how much pain is involved in traveling to and from a crowded movie theater on a saturday night i feel like its my prerogative when i have paid good money to take a film apart if i am still hungry for substance at the end of it and i will get my nourishment from something or other if not from the movies plot itself the first thing that strikes me when i think back to the experience of interstellar is that it leaves me with nothing emotionally  no takeaway i did not care about any of its characters or believe they were real and i did not really worry about the fate of humanity any more than the film itself actually does beyond paying it casual lipservice i wasnt awed like i may have been by other wondrous space movies that interstellar measures itself against or steals from and i am not compelled to go back and see any part of it ever again i suspect most viewers wont either once the collective neophile contact high has passed for starters i do not like the moral core of the story interstellar is a film about saving humanity but it is unclear who will pay for humanitys failures the film offers a great debate over where to repopulate but none about what we have learned from having to leave our home in the first place there is no therapy no penance no sacrifice in a way this represents a subconscious confession about our cultures moral failures when we run out of spaces to consume and out of fertile ground to slash an burn we will have to look for new worlds to expand out into since we cannot show self control and learn to care for what we have but enough psychobabble a dysfunctional moral compass is not the worst thing about interstellar the worst thing about the film is that to quote my girlfriend its ok to for characters to talk in pseudoscientific gobbledygook when the show is star trek because in star trek they all have pointy ears interstellar may be worth a glance certainly for the photography and exciting visuals but it is a buffet of messy ideas that fire in all directions clearly the script is not written by career screenwriters but by a director who has freed himself from gravity and has achieved his own artificial selfsufficiency amid the vast nothingness the result is an often farfetched and unintelligible outlandish tale which takes an awfully long time to suspend the viewers disbelief and cringing to finally arrive at a tepid plot after about an hour or so in hindsight it makes perfect sense that nolans tightest film is memento a discognitive story told from the point of view of a man who is unable to string two events together or to remember where he started interstellar is not an intelligent picture but a pseudointelligent one it seems designed to appeal to the sort of audience who loves to be flattered with cheap shots  a sort of space odyssey version of who wants to be a millionaire? its success resting entirely on the fact that every member of the audience gets to feel superior to whom? no one knows this technique seems to be trending within the nolans filmography for the rest the picture is a narrative mess that trivializes space travel on a galactic scale black hole wormhole same difference and is often plagued by ridiculous starstudded cameos that shatter the viewers concentration by landing in the middle of tense emotional scenes like a cockroach in your soup the film is oddly timed with elliptical cuts that compress the action into some often confusing edits and only leave in lieu of dialog some awful scenes of trite contrived exposition filled with emetic pseudo physics sure to give an immature modern audience raised on batman a sense that they are building their cultural ego by agreeing with this farce worst of all it feels long and never ending sadly good science fiction is hard to come by harder than a good ordinary film even and although this picture is somewhat entertaining it fades away from the heart and mind like the flickering green of the traffic light we just passed as we head home from the cinema once more3 hours of senseless drivel that is what i sat through when i watched interstellar the acting wasnt anything special but the screenplay it had to be among the worst three that i have ever sat through in fact i was close to walking out of it had it not been for the laughing in a scifi film like this the expected reaction was far from the real one instead of a gripping edgeofyourseat effect the screenplay and plot holes were so ridiculously bad that myself and a few other cinemagoers were in stitches laughing like prometheus but somehow worse this film had the adverse effect of inducing laughter in anybody who wasnt blinded by the interplanetary special effects in almost all scifi films there is an enormous twist in the plot or story that will strive to inspire a gasp in viewers some rare films have this effect with an excellently crafted twist not this time the twist in this film was again so extraordinarily awful badly thoughtout and farfetched dont get me wrong these films have the right to go more farfetched than any film has travelled before but this one was just plain bad i had to shout out come on when the credits began to roll inspiring a few more laughs there from viewers in agreement even here at at the end there were still unanswered questions that were to be solved at some point in the course of the film with its mediocre acting awful plot vexingly atrocious twist underdeveloped characters entrusting a savethehumanrace mission to a semirandom trespasser  hellooo??? and boring disposition throughout save your money and head to something  anything  else***spoliers may be listed below**** maleficent is a an iconic villainous role she is one of disneys best characters cast from the dark side and when i saw the trailer i succumbed to the beauty they inlaid using jolie as the sinister evil fairy i was seduced to believing that i would be lured into a world of evil and treachery i wanted to see how evil was born and vengeance would be enacted i wanted to be able to bond with this evil force and be drawn deep into darkness rooting for the bad girl i knew it would be filled with beautiful scenes and disney magic but what i did not anticipate that the greatest treachery would be the film itself jolie can most definitely embrace evil and the moments when she is allowed to succumb to the full force of maleficent it is beautiful once you add in goldie locks however you get a recipe for disaster suddenly i might as well be in a world of pink pixie dust leprechauns and unicorns because this beautiful villain is disgraced into playing a role of a misunderstood black hearted fairy who really loved the doe eyed giggling aurora hell hath no fury than a woman scorned this should have been the driving force behind the film the beginning scenes of a youthful maleficent should have been nixed to allow more time to build a love story that was even remotely believable to fall from grace the betrayal has to be tangible and dripping with poison it must be something more than just a monologue infatuation and stolen wings they said years passed and yet i felt nothing of a bond or great love that would give birth to maleficents destiny in disneys rapunzel the mother figure who raised rapunzel from a baby never fell in love with the child as a daughter she was still greedy evil and dedicated to her path so why must the worlds most wonderful villain turn to a soft hearted godmother of a vapid child i know disney is trending this dont bet on the prince idea and thats fine i support that but reallythey thought this was no truer love if they think the king suffered by simply being tortured with the countdown till his childs demise then they are sadly mistaken that was childs play a woman changed by betrayal to the dark side has more ideas in her playbook that can make a man suffer madness would have been the king knowing that maleficent knew the entire time where aurora was hiding maleficent should have been sending him snippets of hair or visions of his daughter with the raven peering down at him while he slept he should have been physically and mentally destroyed a raving lunatic i would have rather liked to see a double treachery in the story that only the raven knew all along where aurora was and hid it from his mistress we could watch the anger burn and grow within maleficent because she wasnt able to find the child for 16 years that in the interim the raven would randomly turn into human form and it would have been those two that fell in love and the tragic day that maleficent discovers her location through some fools errand played by the three dopey fairies guarding her absconds with the child and lets the curse play out its course then i would have a mega battle scene at the edge of the forest against the king let her have her righteous moment when she takes his life all the while the king knowing his daughter is stuck in endless slumber with no hope of her being saved then during the battle the raven after escaping the battlefield leaves maleficents side to try and wake aurora when maleficent discovers her minions treachery the pain and anger at being betrayed for a second time by her own kind would fill her from the pit of her stomach up through her spine and a black fire filling her eyes transforming to the great dragon and an epic battle of good and evil which will lead to her glorious death that would have at least been something then they could have there happier ever after then all those still shots of maleficent looking like a falling angel in the glimmering sunlight would have been more picturesque more visually twisted overall i feel i paid $15 dollars for another movie funded by the prozac and xanax manufacturers that spread fallacies that evil fairies are really good vampires are not evil blood suckers and werewolves make great best friends its a snooze and a travesty if you love the traditional iconic role of maleficent remain in darkness and forget the lies the trailer told you for the glorious black dragon is covered in daffodils and pink tutus in this film** minor spoiler ** i was really looking forward to this film i like movies and i like science fiction i like most of christopher nolans films and i think matthew mcconaughey has done some great acting work true detective for example so the film seemed to have all the ingredients that would make it enjoyable sadly though i found it to be a disappointment i think there are three reasons for this first and foremost i did not make any emotional connection with the characters matthew was supposed to be the hero and protagonist of the film but i didnt connect to him at all other characters eg the daughter the grown up son the matt damon character i found irritating regardless of the subject matter of a film i need to emotionally connect with the characters in some way secondly there were too many basic plot points that made no common sense im not talking about the science not making science sense as thats accepted and okay in a science fiction film *** spoiler next** for example matthew mcconaughey turns up at the nasa base and without any credible explanation is told hell be the pilot of the space ship?**spoiler ends** thirdly i think in attempt to make a serious weighty science fiction film with gravitas the entire tone of the film became too unremittingly seriousand they omitted to lighten the mood occasionally with a bit of appropriate humour take as a comparison the shawshank redemption which currently tops imdbs greatest movie poll a great film with gravitas and a serious message often emotionally dark and harrowing at timesbut it uses humour appropriately to balance the tone of the overall film so very sadly a real disappointment im afraidand i find myself genuinely puzzled why this film has got such a high imdb ratingin exactly the same way and same reasons that i was puzzled by the high rating for skyfallThis was a bad bad movie. At one point I was going to ask for my money back because I thought that the reels were put in the projector in the wrong order. Save you money. Save you time. The best thing that you can do is to do anything except watch this movie. If I could rate lower that a 1 I wouldin which pretty much the only aspect that doesnt totally disappoint is the cinematography basically an elaboration of the set design on seven even the soundtrack is lukewarm and sounds horribly dated some brothers or someone norton is the kind of actor whom you either can or cannot watch i havent totally decided yet bonham carter still delivers a phoney stateside accent woody allen obviously hasnt helped and pitt only looks good in his eye to eye hotel room sequence with norton anyone who claims they see him as a good actor is either lying or is deluded  the guy just looks good with cropped hair other than this were looking at a film made for awkward teenage boys who cant watch it anyway cause its mostly rated 18 its the slightly older awkward boys who sadly do get to see it and end up slobbering over it and writing rave reviews about it a little rubbish goes a long way these days having appreciated both the game and especially seven id like to think fincher was presented with a job to be done and got away with it lets see what happens next may spoil warning  i seen this in the theaters when it came out in 99 i payed $700 dollars to see it the second i found out the secret i wanted to beat someone up all right no plot plot dont make since if i was in a basement full of guys and had to watch someone abuse them self and they thought it was interesting i would exit as fast as i can i have to wright ten lines in order for me to be able to warn you that i dont even think this qualifies as a movie there is no plot or story that i can see making a movie about therese a point where his nonself shots a gun at him and blows out a van window so is the gun real is the bullet real did the window blow out or was that imaginedpreface i really think i was careful enough with my words to avoid any spoiling but if vague descriptions count as spoilers to you dont read on lets face it  its all about fighting  gruesome stupid uncivilized uncultured immature fighting if you are a caveman go ahead and like this movie if not then i am sincerely grateful for your existence in our world on a side note despite the plot holes i figured out who pitts character was since the endoftheapartment scene id be interested to know if anyone else was able to predict the same thing the very end of the movie falls under the same category as the body  immature shallow and useless i just gotta say it  this is my least favorite movie of all timefight club  anarchy takes a welltrained and organized army peace requires using 19th century technology to end 20th century technology thereby blowing us all back into the 18th century of course this all leads to great sex and a cure for demons inside you and along the way you can beat the hell out of a bunch testosterone leaden fellow travelers a really dumb movie bad acting and some of the most boring cinematography of 1999 skip this onea day after the experience i am still trying to reconcile how the man who was responsible for the magnificent subtlety of seven could create such garbage yes the violence was gratuitous and excessive but oddly enough that was the least of this films worries where to begin the plot was ridiculous on its face absolutely incoherent and nonsensical the various themes of the movie were amplified and remarkably shallow showing no real insight into the problems of our society ours is an overly commercial culture this is neither original nor especially interesting especially when repeated ad nauseam finchers direction and sophomoric mtvstyle presentation did nothing to help a script that never got any further than live free or die with minor variations most of the dialogue reminded me of something my high school english teacher used to say when her students ventured out of their league thats so deep its shallow this succinctly describes the handling of every major theme in the film then there are the performances edward norton an otherwise gifted actor does little with the simplistic character hes given there is no complexity to this character whatsoever and norton can do nothing to help define him his early attempts at playing the neurotic are particularly unconvincing brad pitt has more to work with in the tyler durden character but his tendency to overplay absolutely everything about his character even beyond what the script calls for or should have called for makes nortons performance seem that much more vapid helena bonham carter simply showed upa flop just about everywherecritics talk as though its a classici thought it was the pitsedward norton voice drove me mad i hate voiceoverswas there a point to the moviesome weirdos may get some crazy ideas from ita movie this bad deserves no praisea case of the emperors new clothes if ever i saw onea man tired of his yuppie condo and deadend job moves into a dilapidated house with a stranger and starts an underground club where young men beat each other up to bloody pulp just for the fun of it when that becomes old they engage in terrorist activities there is a lame plot twist which should not surprise most viewers that blows the story full of holes and turns the movie from merely bad to abominably bad culminating in a laughably ludicrous finale the message of this paean to sadomasochism is that a man has to suffer and inflict pain on others in order tosell tickets what is most disturbing is that many consider this vile piece of garbage to be a masterpiece a sad reflection of our societyafter having my little brother and friends hype the heck out of this film and claim it to be the greatest thing since sliced bread this came as a disappointment there were too many boring stretches for me and not much in the way of story it was like a no pun intended onepunch joke that fell flat about 30 minutes into the film brad pitt was good if out of place ed norton delivers his dialogue as if he were asleep and comes across as a secondrate john cusack wannabe helen carter is funny in parts and meatloaf is just hilarious thumbs in the middle for this one this movie fell flat at the boxoffice as struggling 20th century fox and this is not a bad thing tries to come up with fresh ideas to lure the teenage audience without having to recycle 30year old sciencefiction filmsafter watching fight club and before writing this comment here i have watched it 6 times myself alone to find out why it got so many ratings and votes from the audiences just after 2000 i had watched lots and numerous movies existing in the world but so far no single comments are available here in this imdb now i am in bound to express my personal feelings about this unnecessarily overrated movie i find nothing special in this dumb and irritating fight club starring brad pitt and edward norton why did this movie got good stars and many comments just because others are dancing and so they too blindly dancing with them after getting into the story of tyler durden david fincher  i think david is good at making movies based on mental sickness human illusion and social understanding he could have used the actors in better perspective to make the whole story clearer than it is fight club  this movie was actually flopped when it released theatrically worldwide so can we really consider it as a hit or blockbuster no doubt it got momentum when it later came out in dvd i was mostly displeased with the twisting climax which has nothing special to thrill the human mind it is just simple to predict in some points of the story there are some scenes which make bored and eagerly wait to move forward in the next scenes this is not a case with good thrillers like the bourne trilogy series the peacemaker collateral jeepers creepers the recruit paycheck the shooter the departed or say impostor  for my 8 years of continuously watching different types of movies and analysing the choices of the audiences i came to confusion why audiences really admired this movie well it might have became a cultfilm for creating the ideas of building fight clubs but this movie actually has a negative and improper purposes the twisted ending seems to be much dissatisfying in catching the truth but in fact the movie has no concern with the worlds reality brad pitt  i wonder why brad pitt accepted the role as an illusionary tyler durden who rule the narrators way of living surprisingly he turned out as nonexisting person who appears from schizophrenic narrator jack norton i like pitt a lot his role in kalifornia and se7ven and mr & mrs smith but not here edward norton  i was really impressed by his role in only 2 hits  rounders and the italian job but this time also he won my heart for his innocence and ignorant role as jack he did his role as demanded by the script and the director or the producers he was a right choice for this role better than others helena bonham carter  she does not have the necessary looks to become a star or celebrity but by chance she got good remarks for her role here no impressions exist from her role as marla singer but only to look oncealso one of the 10 worst films of all time are we sure ed wood is dead because i swear he must have written cast and directed this major turkey if people claim not to understand this film its merely because they have an iq of 3 i even read one critique by someone who watches this bomb every week talk about not having a life there was a half hour episode of alfred hitchcocks series that had the same plot and was 100 times better than this as to the acting well i couldnt find anyone doing that here but then ed norton is one of the worst actors alive today as is pitt so you shouldnt be surprised there meatloaf was the only person even trying but then he was saddled with an incredibly moronic script written by a 2 year oldand what a waste of talents‰__ and my time yes the movie does have some fancy camera work but i consider david fincher would be more successful to be a tv commercial producer than a movie director from seven to fight club i dont see any growth in his filmmaking dark and grotesque as usual or even more but his movies absolutely has no emotional impact on me excepts the unpleasant after tasteas an earlier comment stated the first 23rds of this movie are truly intriguing the visuals are slick but not in you blademeetsmortalkombat kinda way instead focusing on delivering irony sarcasm and black jokes through flawless direction and edition  and even some hi tech effects like when the credits roll edward norton plays the narrator and the social satire presented during the first half of the flic is simply put awesome because the movie doesnt seem to take itself too seriously  althought it is serious  one plus point is the fact that the narrator doesnt step on a soapbox to preach and condemn he justnarrates and observes however after the first half of the movie is over it suddenly dulls and painfully slows down from the pace from which it begun for starters the attention to detail lowers the dialogues start to dumb down you get this anything can happen now no matter how far fetched feeling and plain and simple it just gets silly as in 6th sense another recent movie there a shocking twist near the end but instead of leaving you gasping for air like in the former here it all seems contrived forced it just doesnt fit all in all fight club is not a bad movie but i really wished it had ended as good as it startedas nonsensical as the game as hollow as american beauty a loud flashy messy bore that had me watching the clock in anticipation of when this movie would end and so end my misery this and american beauty are among the biggest copouts in movie history cynical hollywood manipulations that make fools of their fans within the theatre walls we vent vicariously with the main characters about the evils of consumerism then what do we do after the credits roll eight dollars poorer having enriched and empowered the entertainment system we go back to the very lives these movies condemn now we can even browse through the ikea catalog without guilt because in spirit we have joined the fight club is living the lie okay just because you admit it more hypocritical moviemaking for hypocritical moviegoersyet another turn of the moneygoroundbig strong handsome boys take their shirts off and sweat and fight each other oh boy oh yeah theres a girl in here too helena bonham carter but she kind of acts tough like a guy too lots of posing and posturing in this film its very cool i found it hollow and could care less clockwork orange said it better and was better acted 40 years ago rent that one insteadboring quasiphilosophical violencefeast the plot is dumb the surprise twist is not surprising the dialogue is stiff and lifeless with lines like what youå«re feeling is premature enlightenment furthermore helena bonham carter is really truly miscast how can anyone like this movie i know a lot of people do but i just cannot understand whybrainless movie tries to make a point but comes across only as a cinematic failure a total waste of time which is sad given the admittedly quality performances yet asinine script the first third is promising but ultimately this mess of a picture only goes downhill with each brainless sequence that follows after this picture ended i wanted to erase it from my mind reviews on this site are typical of the below 20 group who like quick editing and dumbed down plots that have a secret message overall rating bomb remember the first rule of fight club is dont see fight clubchuck pallanick is a real piece of worst writing ever existing on this planet this is one fact admit it the fight club flick is a real decent screening of his terribly writing on to a silver screen this is the worst film of all time in all instances in all possible scenarios point no arguing here nothing simply nothing in this unimaginable horrific piece of manure gives any redeeming feature or any clue dirt mud muck slime blood vapid acting hollowness emptiness nihilism and a total waste of 120 minutes just terrible it is so edward norton gives a weak delivery brad pitt does not help too and helena bonham carter is simply awful this is the keyword  awful the whole finchers flick is just awful mess rating  must be minus 1000 but here 1 the worstcoming from cast members whove enjoyed multimillion dollar la weddings etc if youre going to comment on issues as fundamental as this then live the lifestyle otherwise it just doesnt wash you should leave it to someone else pitt is also very unrealistic as a tough guy in this movie his performance in snatch was much better and benefited from some humour the chain smoking carter is also tedious and fake i found this movie both pretentious and irritating ive met many people who found this film illuminating it said absolutely nothing to medavid fincher i think his career might have been a tragedy if he actually made some good early films he had alot of promise but is now sucked into the world of the fanboy where he reins as their god this world is made up of angry youth most of whom like computers violence and sex though they are under experienced with it in actuality no more evident is this than in fight club if you need proof read one of the hundred claims that this is the pinnacle of filmmaking since these people are cultish and do not listen to reasonable argument i will waste so much time as to actually give the entire argument against this film as i see it i think fincher actually had a message however he has no control over his own abilities i think using logic his film is about the value of the individual this is extremely ironic since his film has inspired homogenous worshipers the first third of the film is a damnation of the working environment the last third is im guessing supposed to be a damnation of the second third the second third is the escape from the working class through a violent cult this is only the most logical explanation for me anyway i think many people fail to see the last third as a damnation of the second third because fincher creates it as such a paradise juxtaposed next to the working week fincher is too seduced by his own tricks that he cant convey his own message and we as viewers are left with the remnants of a very negative film with no purpose for its violent destructive nature and no redeeming values at all so maybe it isnt what the film is about most of its fans would gladly join up with the cult and follow tyler into chaos the message of the film is really quite hollow and the way it is done is just silly 310despite remarkable acting this movie is not worth the extraordinarily long time it took to get through it this testosterone laden tale contains a semiinteresting twist toward the end but even that cant make up for the cliche filled you are what you own lame attempt at a moral message dont waste your timedespite the clever crafting of this film it is basically a complainfest about the poor upperclass privileged white male blaming all his woes on ikea is this the extent of selfproclaimed victimization that is taking over american culture disturbingly to any intellectuals this movies amorality passes itself off under the guise of reason  as if the central character has a logic to his rage and subsequent violent decisions  as if the poor young white businessman whos been educated well and raised in an upper middle class lifestyle with all the benefits really is some sort of victim of retail stores is it really proving a coherent point to blow something up its even more upsetting to think about this after seeing 911 take this films logic into realityis the point of this movie to say that american commercial freedom should be attacked with all the sexification and glamorizing of violence and its poorme ranting against consumer products rather than taking responsibility for ones own commercialism or participation in it its hard to find a redeemable netsum to this movie ed norton is as always terrific brad pitt very good in this role too and i very much appreciate the filmmakers talent but i wish he would use it for something that was thoughtfuled norton character i dont know im just not content with my life i have a job that doesnt do anything to benefit mankind i have so many possessions but they dont make me happy i just feel there must be more to life than this shallow commercial material world i live in i want to do something different me well its very commendable of you to reevaluate your priorities so since you dont like your material possessions are you going to get rid of all your ikea furniture and move to a smaller apartment one that you actually feel comfortable in norton no me well since your job isnt fulfilling are you going to quit and join the peace corps or get a job as a teacher in an poor neighborhood norton nah me well since youre looking for some higher meaning to life are you going to start going to church norton nope me sigh okay so what are you going to do norton i think ill get together with a bunch of other unfulfilled guys and then well beat the snot out of each other  if that strikes you as profound well then fight club is the movie for you if it sounds ridiculous and it should avoid it like the plague the ironic and amusing thing is most of the fanboys who rave about this movie are geeks who couldnt fight their way out of a paper bag and would run crying to their mommies if someone even looked like he was going to throw a punch at themfight club 1999 stars brad pitt and edward norton when ed norton gets insomnia he starts to venture into another world when he meets brad pitt this movie makes no sense i had no idea where it was going i was very disappointed in the film i couldve wrote it better and more realistic i wish i didnt see this film i hated every second of it fight club has an interesting plot but i fail to see the actual validity of the punchline having said that i didnt like the film it just doesnt add up correctly if you watch each and every scene however we are watching it through the eyes of edward norton i dont understand all the hoopla over this film go watch the sixth sense for this kind of stuff and if you can believe this can really happenyou are an idiotfight club hooks you fast and has a lot going for it fincher does a great job directing and pitt and norton are great as well unfortunately the last 20 minutes with its clever little twist totally ruined it for me i think that the basic ideas behind the book got lost in the translation to a certain extent but not completelyfight club is not a landmark cultmovie showing a disappointed and frustrated generation this a toolong tedious dull film just made to forgive it asap brad pitt must believe that being a good actor means playing nut insane filthy unshaved peoplefight club is the most overrated movie i have ever seen barely beating out gladiator it is also one of the worst movies ive ever seen its only redeeming quality is if you take it as an examination of mob mentality in a group of reprobates  except in that light its quality ends up seeming like someones final project for their high school psychology class as in amateurish and not very detailed people talk about its depth my answer to that is what depth i have no problem with its premise  people are dissatisfied hey i could handle the computers that rule the future can build a nearlyindestructible attack robot out of liquid metal in terminator 2 dissatisfied people is nothing even the incorrect placement of blame is believable what bothers me though is that the movie attempts to pass itself off as an accurate portrayal of the real world im not saying there arent people like that what im saying is that they arent right they arent automatons theyre unambitious they arent suppressed by an overlymaterialistic society theyre just whining and looking for someone else to blame for their problems i have an easier time believing marxs nonsense about class identity than i do the things this film tries to pass off as meaningful social commentary fight club doesnt have a social message fight club isnt entertaining dont watch fight clubfight club would lead you to believe that is an action thriller which has excitement in it and keeps you gripped until then end well lets just say this film could save the nhs a fortune in sedatives edward norton an amazingly talented actor his talent is mirrored in films such as american history x and so on films where his talent is actually apparent i sat until the end of the film thinking ok anytime soon it will get exciting it was so obvious they way the film was going to go and took a very long time to get there why anyone would cast helena bonham carter is also beyond me brad pitt is an ok actor but is blessed with looks apparently more than he is talent so many people have claimed how amazing this film is but i just do not see it a few predictable twists and turns and the climax at the end is neither here nor there as bad endings go this is one of the worst i have seen glad i did not pay to see this in the cinema if you need something to knock you to sleep check this outfirst off im not going to say this film was terrible and anyone who disagrees with me is an idiot we all have our own idiosyncrasies that colour how we view art and i respect others views enough to know that nothing is categorical terrible or brilliant for every member of the audience but for mei think fight club had something to say but to me it didnt seem very original or subtle among other themes in other films ive seen the two identities thing done much better in david lynchs lost highway and feel american psycho did the male alienation in corporate america thing in a subtler and funnier way fight club seemed so straightforward and obvious that i felt like the director was dumbing it down for me almost insulting my intelligencei dont know maybe its just my taste im glad so many people did get so much out of it though that is one of the most important criteria for a film to have to be considered great so i guess this is a great filmfirst the good stuff the acting was superb edward norton was very strong though i expected more somehow and brad pitt was a phenomenon im glad sean penn pulled out of this role though im sure he would have nailed it as well and in a very different way ill bet the direction was also interesting though it seemed like the director was enjoying himself to much so much of it seemed like the wouldnt it be cool if style of direction now the bad stuff this plot is more full of holes than independence day i mean it makes absolutely no sense whatsoever other reviewers have said that if you go to this movie you must be prepared to think very true you must think about the films themes and the films subtext every step of the way this was extremely interesting and enjoyable but whatever you do please do not think about the plot it doesnt hold up under any scrutiny at all at a very basic level this film doesnt make sense i cant elaborate without throwing out a huge spoiler so i wont if you ask me plot is the first thing if you have a weak plot that can be forgiven by other strengths but if your plot cant even stand up without the willful indulgence of a forgiving audience then youve already fouled up too big to ignore this movie could not have been good without massive script alterations no matter how good the acting how good the directing how clever the dialogue this movie could not have been other than a travesty of modern film horrible on the other hand from the number of posters here who seem to think that edward nortons character was named jack its quite clear that people indeed dont pay very close attention to films no wonder this film is so highly regardedgratuitous violence and a cheesy madeforteenagers twist at the end i suspect that males under the age of 20 will love it though the drivel disguised as philosophy will fool the naive and someone somewhere will be dumb enough to emulate the fighting one or two visits to the hospital though will be enough to change most folks mindshave you ever had flu or food poisening and have been laid up in bed with a fever you know the feeling you loose all track of time  you are not sure if you have slept and your dreams drift in to real life have you ever been so drunk that you wish you were dead the feeling is the worst in the world isnt it watching the fight club is all these feelings rolled into one i can honestly say this is nearly the worst film i have ever seen i wont try to go into what the film is about because i could not tell you this film last 16 hours or so it feels looking at the box it says 133 minutes i would rather have spent 133 minutes sticking pins under my finger nails what complete rubbish please dont watch it 1 out of 10havent seen it but i know its crap the popularity of this movie and its director invalidates the claim that its iconoclastic any movie that is this popular is false opposition period you think a major movie studio would finance something that truly threatened the establishment the passion of the christ was a truly iconoclastic movie it scared the crap out of the establishment which is primarily jewish and masonic which is why the talmudists in hollywood went after gibson with all their force you can also tell a lot about a movie based on its fans ive never encountered anyone who likes this movie who isnt a poseur usually young white dorky guyshaving just finished viewing fight club on video my opinion is it was awful however i noticed i was in the vast minority of others who voted just goes to show how opinions can vary i did like the cast and felt the three lead characters were very good but their talents were wasted if you took out the popularity and charisma of pitt and norton and replaced them with lesser known actors the video would hardly be worth watchinghonestly this movie marks some fresh and new to cinema great film making style and plot direction and cast was good too but here comes the boomthis film represents the modern era where anything can be sold to the fools just by advertising and wrapping it in a catchy packing so while watching this movie i was feeling as if i am getting sick literally but i just watched it because of its high rating the film talks about releasing self from limitations and lack of emotional strength so far so good but a dying patient cant be cured by hypnosis it is a useless effort now our patient is dying death is playing its game and his relatives around himall those who loved the moviethinks that due to hypnosis their beloved patient is not crying that means not feeling pain that means getting cured now thats what i call fools gold honestly again but i am not buying this stuffhow can we get brad pitt edward norton and meatloaf to beat the cp out of each other this movie solves that problem and gives the studio license to shoot a film veiled in psuedophilosophies and violence its just dumb dont try looking beneath the surface because nothing is there maybe thats the point it provides that men are imasculated and shackled by modern life their spirits crushed by their jobs and their possessions in order to escape you fight its so simple give up the banalities of ordinary life and find your individuality in a black tshirt fight gang makes sense teenage males will certainly think so since it is filmed in the mtv style bright color palette fancy edits blood mesmerizing and simple philosophies tend to go over well on that demographic it actually starts our promisingly i loved the first quarter only when it attempts to provide us with answers that are sorry far out of the grasp of the writers does it fail film buffs may want to view it simply for one of the sloppiest tackedon surprise endings in cinema history i could only laugh bottom line dumbhow do you know youre crazy when your masculine side is banging your feminine side and all you can do is listen this highly regarded film is nihilistic garbage offensive and pretentious all attitude and jungian stereotypes skip iti agree completely with the negative critics statements on the inside of the dvd this movies defenders have tried to pass it off as cerebral and psychological on this very page and as a profound portrait of how corporations ruin our lives it is none of these first of all what makes people think its cerebral the endless whining the laughable were all the middle children of history attempts at philosophizing the hardly novel idea that men need to have an outlet for their pentup aggression and the leftist idea which has been out there since at least the time of marx that corporations have been destroying our lives and screwing us over praise the movie as cerebral and youd better be cerebral yourself to recognize it get yourself a book of dostoyevsky or kant and see how you handle real deep thought second off that its psychological simple because the main character has a certain mental disorder i wont be so bad to reveal what it is is it psychological after we see the characters illness in the movie it seemed to me norton fighting pitt was like a bad candid camera joke i was halfexpecting the director to come on after the scene and say you took that scene seriously sucker its amazing what this movie expects you to believe particularly after the plot twist which like the usual suspects to which it has been often compared is just too clever by a half and voids entire sections of the movie im a fan of ed norton because i like his work i also liked seven quite a bit so i can hardly be dismissed as a fincherhater and i still agree that men in our society are fundamentally demasculinized in a way previous generations never had to deal with but after seeing this movie i think the solution may be worse than the curei am 34 i have seen thousands of films and this is unquestionably the absolute worst it is evil technically well done but evil still this film shits on every value i hold dear  honesty hard work liberty of thought nonviolence respect of others as equals reason as my best tool to make something of my life it glorifies senseless destruction of property and which is much much worse of able minds in cultlike brainwashing to serve egoistical means every problem should be overcome with violence lies or blackmail every man who is not you is there to be used or beaten into a pathetic degenerate there is no respect of the other also the plot twist had me wincing it was so very obvious from the start that when it happened i just sighed and shook my headi am mad i had wasted 2 hours of my life seeing this garbage because i read all the high ratings from members is everybody crazy to rate this crap over 8 this is about as stupid as 12 monkeys i bet its the same people who liked that movie like this one brad pitt made a great movie  meet joe black he made so many other stupid movies  or inconsequential such as  the mexican hes a handsome man but other than that can never be tom cruise i dont like tom cruise  hes not as nice as brad but he sure is a great actor this movie is all about violence anarchy annihilation why does anybody think blowing up a building beating the crap out of each other committing suicide is worth making a movie about this is very irresponsible of the director as this is what brought us columbine virginia tech and massive killing mayhem on a daily basis how can all this be entertainment i think the people liking this movie must be either juveniles the video game crowds mindless activitywho never pick up a book read the newspaper  be pro family or somewhat low iq to watch this pointless idiotic moviei cannot believe the number of rabid fans this sophomoric selfindulgent piece of watered down nietzsche crossed with herman hesses steppenwolf has garnered if this film was a lifechanging experience for some of the reviewers i am wrung with pity at what that life must have been before and with the thought of what it can have become there was some amusing satire in here but you had to wade through a lot of adolescent posing and prosing to hear it i am commenting only because i think this tawdry junker needs a counterpoint to its unmerited adulation if you found a lot in this movie and want to watch it again and again to validate your deep philosophical and artistic insights you need to broaden your horizons grow up and join the real world ask for more from your art than thisi cannot believe this film is rated so highly granted there is a hollywood bias in this database but rarely is such an idiotic film given such accolades after seeing the poster for this film i had no interest in seeing it but i watched it on the advice of a trusted friend and was amazed at how much it was exactly as i had expected originally a macho guy film on a par with the die hards and lethal weapons of this world rambo tooi dont know about anyone one else but when i watch a film i have one goal to be entertained i can say without any reservation i was not entertained for even one minute during fight club what really shocks me is that this film is rated so highly apparently so many who have watch this film find the bizarre so appealing to me a film is good when its entertaining you know enjoyable to watch i found nothing even remotely enjoyable about this film fight club is nothing more than a film about dysfunction and lots of it bizarre hallucinations and violence is this thought provoking or intelligent sorry i dont see that my recommendation if youre a person who looks for true entertainment in a film look elsewhere i am definitely worse off for spending 25 hours on fight club i give it 1 out of 10i for one hated this moviei only saw it once and it was a long time ago so forgive any incorrect references personally i dont know if i saw it again now if my opinion would be differentmaybe but somehow i doubt it the beginning was interesting enough to entertain mespecifically the whole him going to different group session things as a hobby and then meeting marla who does the same thing thats interesting i think the whole thing started to bore me about when the movie started going nowhere from what i remember it was just marla living there and brad pitt beating the crap out of edward norton every night or whatever it just lost its interest the end was a cool twist the whole tyler thingit was interesting but the film as a whole i dont think was just very well presented maybe if id read the book itd make more sense i just think i didnt like it because it didnt make sense to me i understand this makes me a bit of an outcast because everyone loves fight club but i apologizejust not my taste if anyone wants to just explain a few key points out for me or something thatd be great just please dont rip me a new one because i understand i am like the only one who doesnt like that movie slidei hated every single second of this miserable movie its boring unfunny and totally depressing everytime norton does his voiceover i wanted to cry he has the dullest voice in the history of film norton is so over rated i dont know why he is seen as a good actor i am a fan of pitt but he is totally wasted and i came to realise this is sadly nortons film not pitts if you want to to be bored and depressed for a few hours feel free to watch this trashi have just finished watching fight club simply put it is the most profoundly depraved and deeply disturbing film i can ever remember seeing if our culture was not crumbling at a full gallop we would see this vile and wicked film for what it is could such a film have been made even twenty years ago will anyone care or even take notice of such a film twenty years from now we are losti have read many reviews for this movie and most of them used words like unique excellent and life changing i have just one question how the acting by both the leads was good i got to admit that but havent people heard of something called a script the movie was just a collection of pathetic scenes each one leaving you more confused and bored then u were before well for direction there wasnt any all in all i have to say i have seen my share of bad movie this one is a strong contender for the top spot its a shame talent like brad pitt considered doing such a mindless senseless scriptless and tasteless movie which even the brilliant acting by the male leads couldnt save the one point is purely for the actingi have read other reviews of this movie and i think that my outlying grossly negative opinion may have something to do with the fact that i do not identify at all with this movie i am proud to say this it is sad that so many people did see something of themselves in this movie i feel truly sorry for you it was obviously never this movies intent to be entertaining or to make you care about the characters humanity or societyi know everyone is saying that this movie is great it has so much to say about society the script is so good blah blah blah for the first time in my life however i was motivated actually to get up and to leave the theatre in the middle of the film yes the movie has a message beyond fighting is good but it is just so inyourface that i couldnt take any more after the first hour it did not help that i didnt care what happened to any of the characters even though i dont have a problem with brad edward or helena generally anyone who saw this movie and came away wondering exactly what the director was trying to say must have been asleep i dont think that a film has to be completely offensive to make a point of course this is only my opinion i know there is supposedly a plot twist at the end and whatever it was it just could not have been worth another hour and a half of this film to get to it by the way i have seen other offensive movies and enjoyed them natural born killers being one of them so i am not just being a weenie about the whole thing i liked se7en and i completely loved the game but this one just is not up to their standards see one of these movies instead if you have never seen a fincher film beforei ordinarily dont take the time to comment on things of this nature but this is possibly the worst movie i have ever seen fight club had absolutely no plot and no message to give to the audience it was replete with violence sex gore all with no purpose whatsoever the movie said nothing  it was just film and actors if i had to describe this movie in one word it would be gratuity there was gratuitous sex violence and blood and guts apparently a lot of people enjoyed this movie and i dont know what that says for our society and how easily we can be entertained this movie is a waste of anyones time i highly recommend that you stay as far away from fight club as possiblei really didnt enjoy this film at all & i fall into the target group male 2030 210 id give this there seems a belief too that anyone who doesnt enjoy it is either thick against violence or especially doesnt get the message behind it well none of those apply to me in this flawed film i understand that it was any of aa group of young men rebelling against a borgeousie consumerism society bone man seeing how he is totally dissatisfied with life and how his mind tries to change things or cpeople stopping to watch cornelius fight himself because voyeurism is human nature the film makes a deliberate attempt to make the viewer feel guilty for being a voyeur ill come to that later you can take your pick really whatever way i still find it crap any film shawshank redmeption excepted which concerns one mans anything generally creates no emotion in me other than boredom the whole tagline to the film makes me want to puke one 30 year old mans journey of selfdiscovery so what are we supposed to sympathise with norton because of this im sorry but i have sympathy in films with people dying or whos family have been killed john hurt triumphing over cancer in champions tom hanks in saving private ryan thousands of others even norton himself actually in the brilliant american history x in the 2nd half i sympathise with him for the life he has found himself with but in this and i find myself saying the same as i did with the equally awful american beauty just because some blokes fed up & having a midlife crisis were supposed to feel for him oh diddums the only film where this premise has worked brilliantly is its a wonderful life with james stewart he was in crisis and justifyably too but never resorted to any of the levels stooped to here that might seem a weak point but its just come to me & i cant put my finger on exactly why wonderful life is so far superior to fight club in tackling a midlife crisis but they are as far extreme as you can get id also question whether were all voyers for every moron that slows down on a motorway to look at an accident on the other side theres a 100 or so that cant believe the stupidity of it there are countless flaws too the scene prior to the car crash wouldnt have worked who was norton talking to with the passengers there where did he acquire his knowledge of soap from would people have watched 1 bloke fighting himself and much more too ok maybe one or 2 of those have answers but i couldnt find them i think to really enjoy this film you have to have clicked or empathised with the main character and if you did i feel a bit sorry for you it would however account for the popularity of such things as marriage guidance councillors drugs footballers agents even to a degree religion but only when it becomes absolutely fanatical & life revolves around it maybe its just me & im fortunate but so many people seem unable to get through the little problems that life throws up on their own & without help of any kind anymore like inventing a friend for one thing i know plenty of people who like this intelligent some of them so ive no problem with people who enjoy arty & deep films with psychological meaning to them i just dont but not through failing to understand them just merely through not connecting with characters who suffer problems like a midlife crisis for non deserving reasons on top of all of that it was a very slow film tooi refuse to give away details of a film therefore this commentary is directed at people who have already seen the movie and may be a bit obscure to those who have not silly plot gratuitous violence way too long and very predictable if the mono frame shots of pitt and the identical baggage clues werent enough to explain exactly what was happening then hb carters reaction scene when norton asks her what she is doing there the morning after should have made it crystal clear for anyone over twelve i was shocked by how many previous comments referred to an unexpected twist at the end fight club is simultaneously homoerotic and homophobic i think the overwhelming popularity of this film among 1825 year old confused males unfortunately may be explained by the concept repeatedly expressed throughout the film that it is ok to bond with or even hug other men but only if you also hurt each other i can only recommend purchasing or renting this dvd to those readers who are both somewhat sadistic and not very brighti remember reading somewhere that mr bpitt said that the significance of this film would be appreciated by people of next centurywhat does that mean and who makes him the expert on peoples thought in the next century all i hope is that he should be born in the next centuryso that i dont have to see his face and hear his name all the time while i am alive i am feeling increasingly that we as moviegoer are becoming snobbish all the time it seems nowadays movies are intended not for you to watchbut for you to interpretthen instead of taking coke and popcorn into cinemas we should have a notebook and pencil at hand what this movie is all abouti dont knowand i am wondering how many of you people out there do know what it is and why it is so greatare there really so many extreme situations and times in our lives if it isthen staying normal should be viewed as something abnormalafter allwhat is wrong with the ordinary mens life and feelingsshouldnt movies display these instead of showing people the extreme cases all the time as to mr norton i have but just one feelingtruly admirationof all the movies i have seen him playing he is always suffering from a split personalityhe must either be a complete nuts or the toughest guy alivepsychologicallyand what is funny about peoples high appreciation of him is that there must be so many of you who are living experts on abnormity of personality otherwise how can you truly appreciate a thing weird as that honestly i hate movies like thisits so called tasteonly makes people snobbishto meit is far more noble to go to a moviebecause you want to see a certain actor or actressthen because you are told this is one deep movie by those sick film criticsi saw this film at a free preview about a week before it was released and two years later i can still remember how angry i was wasting an evening on this drivelthe whole premise that these guys cant feel any emotion unless theyre beating the hell out of each other is ridiculous and boringi cant remember one thing i liked about this movienot the scriptnone of the performancesthe editing or cinematographynothingmaybe this film taps into the current anarchist views and aspirations of whatever generation were up tobut who caresif there was a score lower than onei wouldnt hesitate to mark it on my balloti saw this film at the cinerama dome on sunset strip in hollywood when it was first released i am upset with myself for not walking out in the middle and demanding my money back i stayed and gave it a chance to my utter dismay this foul piece of crap is one of the worst films i have ever seeni get more pleasure out of deliberately bad films like  plan 9 from outer space  fight club  actually masquerades as something artistic meatloaf discarded any dignity or selfrespect he might possess by accepting this pathetic roleaside from the sick i dont mean the current vernacular premise and the idiotic plot the fact that morons are out there now beating the hell out of each other in basements as a form of mimicry and tribute is disgusting to mean abomination of a moviei saw this movie about 3 years ago for the first time and i was impressed i really liked that movie very much i got the blu ray quality now and decided to check it out again after i finished watching this movie i told to myselfthis is so stupid this movie does not make any sense it is the movie about some psycho schizo guy i dont know how why its got 88 rating if you look at this movie seriously you can find so many mistakes and errors and so much stupidity in that movie i will never want to see this movie again in my life luckily you can download any movie for free nowadays before buying it i give this movie 1 star for good actors only if there were different actors 1 star would be too much other than that this movie is a big mistakei voted this movie be 110 stars on this website which is way to much for a movie like this i didnt like the atmosphere in the film at all beating each other without any reasonable reason besides that there were lots of blasphemic things in this movie in combination with very violent language i think filmmakers show that they are incompetent by using a script that contains lots of violent words why would you might think right now almost all real good movies like gladator the green mile lord of the rings and the shawshank redemption show us that you create atmosphere by good acting and story tellingtherefore you dont need actors to use blasphemic language all the time this movie was bought by a friend of mine and we watched it at his home we both got so sick and tired to watch this crap that he opened the dvd player even before the movie actually ended and broke the dvd we went smoking outdoorsbut my evening was truly spended on a movie worthless to seei was not going to watch this movie because the previews did not appeal to me and i am probably the only woman living who does not think that brad pitt is sexy however i have heard several people tell me what a good movie this is and more than half were women so it came on cable and i decided to watch it at 2 hours i turned it off and i was sorry that i waited that long i kept hoping that it would get better i understand the materialism is bad theme i also understand the concept of ed nortons character having everything but feeling so lonely and depressed that he starts fight club with brad pitt in order to get attention and feel wanted what i dont get is after starting the fight club why start making bombs and blowing up buildings so the point that i get from this movie is that it is ok to start andor join terrorists organizations because someone is unhappy pathetic and generally miserable with their life i guess that all the folks that found this movie appealing and humorous did not have friends or love ones in the world trade towers or the pentagon because wasnt it a bunch of unhappy miserable materialisthating people that bombed both of those places the only thing that makes me depressed are movies like thisi wasted $650 tonight seeing fight club i plan on returning to the theatre tomorrow and requesting a refund from the manager because i do not want my dollars supporting such a movie i would call it a film but it does not deserve such an honor the best way i can describe this movie is to say that i came away from it feeling visually and mentally raped it was thoroughly violent but violence is not what offended me most the violence for violence sake offended me the pointlessness of the movie offended me the god hates you dialogue offended me i was glad to see that 2 other people had already agreed with me and given the movie a rating of 1 do not waste your money on this movie do not waste your time on this movie brad pitt fans  resist the urge to see this attack on your selfworth and intelligence i could go on but you get the picture fight club  stay awayi watched end of days directly after this disjointed feature and the ahnold piece came out looking like the godfather there was a lot of talk when alien3 came out that david finchers limitations as a music videocommercial director would hamper the films presentation i was pleasantly surprised that this ended up not being the case apparently he has decided to devolve into that predicted state this film was not a bad idea and the acting was good with what was provided so that leaves us with the presentation being the problem the focus of the film was very disjointed the dialogue was vague and an seemed to try too hard and coming up with the next big quotable and the cinematography was  well  fincher  if youre going to roll a film that is so colorless just make it black and white id love to see them remake this movie with some different direction  there was some real potential in iti went to see this with a friend because id heard it was good at the local imax theater no less i went in with absolutely no knowledge on it whatsoever once i actually saw it i realized it was one of the worst movies ive ever seen and ive seen some real stinkers id rather have my eyelids held open by toothpicks while tied to a chair in front of a screen showing a back to back ed wood marathon i cant think of a single thing i enjoyed about fight club what there is of a plot is all over the place the lines are beyond cringeworthy its way too preachy and the plot twist at the end manages to veer off way past the range of strange into the range of bat crazy the secret longing of men is to beat each other up in basements and blow up buildings who knew much like the fights theres no subtlety in the plots yeah yeah materialism is bad were not what we own blah blah blah did we really need that pounded into our skulls for almost 2 hours if you feel like youre in a rat race and you hate your job then quit and find something to do thats more worthwhile to you i could hardly believe that was brad pitt his performances in 12 monkeys and se7en were far superior to this trashy flick is fincher incapable of making a movie that doesnt look like the lenses have been sprayed with campbells beef broth the cinematography is choppy and theres only so much i can take of random dudes beating the snot out of each other for no reason they should have used some of that soap to clean up the film from me 1 stari wont try to write an outline of the film others have done a good job of that here already ill just confine myself to observing my own reaction to it this is one poor movie due to the buildup i expected something pretty good my enthusiasm went progressively downhill as i watched the story develop and when ed norton performs the revealing scene which i suppose i should not describe here i felt like pulling the tape out right there i was that insulted i am struck with jaw dropping amazement at the vote results here in imdb what possible value does this movie have to place it higher than so many great films in the top 250 list i have a feeling that this flick speaks to the 16 to 21 year old male the same group that the worlds armies traditionally love to make eager immortal uncritical soldiers from i would like to see a demographic breakdown of the registered voters in imdb i get the impression that a hoard of enthusiastic male youths flooded the imdb with high votes immediately after the release of this puerile tale oh well if you want to vote this sloppy trash highly knock yourself outive heard many people say and seen many reviews written that fight club is a classic mind blowing completely fresh sorry but i just dont see it ill start with the positives ed norton and brad pitt were excellent pitt perfectly captures the supercool no attachments nothingtolose attitude that so many young guys have before they get old and come back down to earth norton is also perfect as the uptight frustrated yuppie bored with lifes vapidity even helena bonham carter who i normally dont much care for was okay in the generic girlfriend role now on to the negatives the story is just utterly preposterous maybe even more so than finchers last absurd movie the game the movie really lost all believability when fight club turns into the cult project mayhem although it has a nice twist ending with the pittnorton dynamic i couldnt buy that they could get legions of grown men to become such mindless fanatical followers pitts charismatic but not nearly charismatic to cover up the fact his philosophy is tired and his idea of subversion is nothing except vandalism and petty theft the movie has pretensions of making a statement about consumerism but i thought it made them pretty succintly with the intro where norton describes his perfect condo filled with things he really didnt need everything else is overkill and the final big plan to blow up i wont say what in case you havent seen the movie yet in order to level the world playing field iswellpointless just like the game fincher takes some good parts and sews them into a tapestry of mediocrity i give it 6 out of 10if director david fincher wanted us to honestly believe that we have not evolved one bit from the scum that at one point inhabited this earth than he has brillantly done it the first problem i have with this film is that it drags on about a half an hour to long and trust me that half an hour at the end could possibly be the stuipidest ending ever what starts off as a promising look at a bunch of low lives letting off some stream by beating the hell out of each other mainly due to the always great edward norton slowing take a nose dive into pure stupidity this movie becomes so trashy i had to take a shower directly after watching it to feel clean again the main problem with this film is that there is only about 15 minutes of fighting the rest is a bunch of losers running around the city destroying things and then turns into a comptly unbeliveable ghost story the film is not a complete watse though due to several amusing scene in which ed norton punches brad pitt in the ear and when pitt edits images of male genitalia into childrens movies but besides that this could very well be the worst movie ive ever seen so unless there is absolutly no other options steer clear of this trashy messif senseless violence and acrimonius rage are your idea of a good time get help this movie is profound rage and mind numbing horses with no plot a cynical theme and nihilistic metaphysical worldview i thought it may have been about boxing clubs not hypomanic arsonist with dark visions of paranoid delusion hours passed by without any meaningif you find anything at all edifying in this film then you must be incredibly gullibleeven for a filmgoer never got past the idea that we were being sold this supposed critique of our consumerist soulless society by none other than news corporation rupert murdoch these people are just toying with youtheyre in it for the money and have no conviction whatsoever as is born out by the endingthe film goesnowhere avoid this nonsenseif youre looking to waste an evening with overindulgent tripe then this just might be the film for you david fincher has made an entire career out of making films that cater to the lowest common denominator and the basest of instincts and with fight club he outdoes himself whats worse than finchers hamfisted direction is the performance of the nonactors brad pitt and edward norton everything they do tends to either be overthetop bad or so very unforgettable as to almost be nonexistent from uninspiring frame one to the thank god its over final frame this pictures drags itself around on its half baked premise like the last steps of someone on their last breath of life save yourself the time and seek out something far more substantial than thisit is a very entertaining film with all the violence and actions the plot is somewhat intriguing as well however i just felt that the film tries too hard to deal with the topic of the unconscious and the other half of self yet it falls very short of developing it as a themem in the end other than chewing on some popcorns i got nothing out of that movieits amusing to see all the brilliant comments about this crap film fincher a smoke and mirrors hack who is convinced that more is more wants to sell you on the idea that were living shallow lives the proofs in the pudding here folks he bashes you over the head with his themes like a college sophomore he is a master of the odious puerile wouldnt it be cool if this happened school of story construction the film is filled with desperate attempts at comedy mostly of the grossout toilet variety  so no doubt the sub20 dilettantes are enthralled  but the film is walltowall form over substance most annoying are finchers pet signature moments  youll see them in all his worthless work mention a pilot light  and voilÌÊ the camera flies around a stove and shows you a pilot light presumably he finds this is magical as he repeats it everywhere  but we know its simply his unleashed attention whore personality being imposed where it doesnt belong theres no need to spoil the ending  its obvious to any thinking person within the first 10 minutes whats going on fjust came from a sneak preview of this movie edward norton was nice enough to bring the movie to his alma mater yale university but unfortunately it doesnt live up to the preliminary hype or to the quality of his other work the problem here isnt acting he is still good in a demanding role that merited top billingrather than being put under pitt and the rest of the cast does admirably as well although brad pitt has played a role much like this beforesee 12 monkeys and helena bonham carters role is pretty much as demeaning to women as it gets jared leto and meat loaf yes meat loaf are also in this movie although you may not recognize leto with a badly scared face or meat loaf with breastsno i didnt stutter this film owes a lot to the game david finchers last movie in that it ends up with a complex plot that is solved a little too easily and nonlogically i wont destroy the film by explaining how exactly but the movie basically builds up to a climax that just doesnt resolve much and then resolves that with a further illogical ending the laughs along the way are not for the faint of heart or those who dont appreciate black comedy but they are the highlights of the film from the odd humor of norton and carter being addicted to help sessions for diseases they dont have to pitts interesting use of liposuction byproducts theres never too much appeal to the violence of the movie but the combination of nihilism and comedy doesnt send the movie into mediocrity its when the movie turns serious that it starts to turn sour as the plot twists out of control and a strange comedy turns into just another movie in the seventhe gamethe matrix genre of stylish mindless violence without much purpose point or original plot the script shows elements of literature that may have just been better in the original book but otherwise this is a movie with not much going for it except its cast answering questions edward norton joked about how working with brad pitt was easier for him because he could always rag on him about pitts bad movies whenever hed get on me id just have to say cool world and also said he thought he had yet to be part of a stinker this may just be his first and pitts latestjust the fact that most men that drool over this film tend to react angrily when i convey my negative opinions of fight club proves that this film not only fails to deliver any new and important ideas but also that it encourages the mainstream male marketing plan be angry be violent be masculine be straight be selfish and most of all be stupid the film employs a juvenile sense of humor comedy approach thats immature and sickening the ending is a total idiotic rip off that makes the watching of this garbage a waste of time the deep message here is that young white males victimized by society can fight commercialism by beating the st out of each other wow man thats really deep cue you just dont get the movie man yeah i just dont get the movie what a joke the whole premise behind fight club is tiresome and trite oh the poor straight healthy young male and how hes been victimized fight club is a movie produced by the sickening hollywood greed machinelet me just get this out of the way right off the bat  i hated this movie i think the initial meeting of jack and tyler explain how opinions of this movie are divided  jack says something about single serving friends and tyler disinterestedly dismisses his cleverness unfortunately my friends being clever for clevers sake is not entertaining and it is not art for those of you who loved this movie perhaps identifying yourselves with the main character is not appropriate the point may be that you are just one of the moronic automatons do hyperclever acts of terrorism like a hyperclever movie so the jokes on you you might also note that the project chaos morons are not recruited for their propensity for violence but for their desire to think in complex and sensitive ways much like the fans of this movie i tend to rate a movie on only two criteria was it entertaining and did i care about the characters as both of these answers for fight club are definitely no what am i left with a movie with an unoriginal message revealed in an unintellible way full of commercials starbucks busch beer pepsi to name a few with decent acting yes the pseudointellegentsia are all suckers easy prey to a little pretentiousness they identify with in making this obvious fact a little more obvious the movie was a success maybe the point was to think for yourselves in which case the only natural reaction should be complete loathing for this filmmy husband talked me into this after time and time again saying i dont want to watch a movie about fighting i guess he thought the beginning was better than i thought it was i guess if you get kicks out of people whose lives are completely the dumps then watch this movie its only mildly amusing before the fighting if youre a mentally stable personnote to mr pitt dark glasses and a scruffy somewhat swollen face isnt working we understand youre a male actor and im certain a good spirit with pretty much a pick of the a list in tinsletown but cut your losseskiddo golden boy aint so bad a draw heyid welcome you into my own dilapidated boudoir anytimebright yellow playtex gloves or notbut on screenkeep it simple i think girls prefer you that way too question for mr fincher are you too hip for your own good or not enough to know better i escaped with barely a bruise to my patience after an hour and ten minutesfeeling immediate relief in dusks warm radiance while fleeing homewardconvinced once more that reality is so much hipper than hollywood spends so many billions contriving it to be otherwisenothing is worse than a film that pretends to be intellectual and profound yet is really just a boring rant against society this film is just that the plot is nonexistent the story is full of holes and the only worthwhile acting is done by edward norton i still cant figure out why the main female character was even in the film this is just a transparent schizophrenic bad movie and is amazingly shallowon one level this movie entertains making you laugh with sharp and witty dialogue irony and utter insanity of the plot on another level as a film  as art it fails miserably this is the kind of movie you should watch with a relative detachment because theres no reason to actually delve into the philosophy the point of the movie if there is one is simply to entertain the audience if the directorscreenwriterproducercast meant it to be deeper it got lost in the parody i will admit that i was very entertained by the performances of all the leads and even meat loaf was fun to watch in his small role however this does not make up for the fact that fight club tries to play with your mind and give a new spin on random subjects like mass media masculinityviolence and society when in fact it spreads itself too thin and through the conclusion of the movie completely sullies whatever decent arguments it had bottom line watch it for pure fun no more there is no hidden treasure herequite unfortunate i respect most of the people in this movie and they do show some good acting chops in this movie unfortunately its a pale screenplay directed with no distinction ed norton had already done a brilliant movie about fascistwannabes with american x so what was the point of getting involved in this mess norton deserved better as did pitt bonhamcarter and leto sad  i was hoping for a meditation for modern life and the culture of violence i guess ill just have to go back to american history x and natural born killerssorry but i thought this movie was so hyped up for nothing i thought it stinked maybe it doesnt deserve the 1 i gave it but i am not pleased with the high rating it has definetly not in the top 100 movies of all time are you madspoiler this is one of a few movies overrated by wannabe intellectuals the script is slick in that it disguises its propaganda propaganda you ask lets start off with the fact that edward nortons character in this movie is psychotic and brad pitts doesnt exist brad pitts character tyler durden is a figment of nortons imagination because nortons character is psychotic this whole plot twist becomes even more aggravating when you realized you wasted over two hours watching a movie about a psychotic anarchist the movies message is great for impressionable kidsthat could possibly describe what this movie is awful i know most of you will disagree with me but sorry it sucked first off there is no acting in this movie you could put any actors in place of brad and edward and it would be the same but in my opinion neither of them should never win an oscar anyway for any of their works second what was going on i mean i get the story of edward trying to be someone else and all but it was told well at all it was a very dark movie saying this is the best movie of all time makes me laugh there is no way it can be if you want to argue about this let me know fight club = fthe first 10 minutes made me think this was going to be a great movie worthy of the high ratings given by those on imdb however i can just barely see its value as a unique story through the lame dialogue and ridiculous plot it was too difficult of a film for me to enjoy i stuck with it but was thoroughly disappointed midway through the film good performances but other than thatcertainly no where near my top 250 filmsthe first 10 minutes made me think this was going to be a great movie worthy of the high ratings given by those on imdb however i can just barely see its value as a unique story through the lame dialogue and ridiculous plot it was too difficult of a film for me to enjoy i stuck with it but was thoroughly disapointed midway through the film good performances but other than thatcertainly no where near my top 250 filmsthe first half hour or so was pretty entertaining even if most of it consisted of edward norton telling us what we were seeing you know god forbid we should use our abilities to surmise whats going on and since i saw it on video i could use slomo to catch brads wheres waldo bits as soon as norton met brad it was all downhill even a really fine insightful actor would have had a hard time making those pretentious lines sound significant but brad pitts spewing of them was like a nearsighted used car dealer reading cue cards this movie was so obvious so pretentious and such a total con job right up to the absurd plot twist threequarters of the way through that completely invalidated everything that came before it also for a movie that was so preachy about consumerism you are not your car your khakis all that hackneyed nonsense did anyone else notice that all the tired young execs at fight club proper seemed to spend alot of time at the gym nary a pot belly to be found save for poor meat loaf who was somehow exempt from the no shirtno shoes rule largebreasted meat loaf fighting shirtlessnow that would have been shocking everything this movie had to say has been said before and better and sometimes just as badly see zabriskie point for another example of an overblown smug rumination on being yourself and getting back to basics vs evil products like wonder bread fight club was just a cynical exercise from a selfimportant director seeing how much he could get away withthe movie is about an ordinary guy who leads an ordinary drab life trying to rise above his position near the bottom of the corporate ladder you soon find that he is an insomniac later you find that he also has another personality his other personality is an antiestablishment anticonsumer antigod antieverything uninteresting psycho the movie centers around this psychotic idiot creating an army of even stupider lowlifes to do his bidding which includes destruction of and creating chaos within our established social system the fight club is the army and it began when men decided that they got a wonderful release by inflicting and receiving pain during fights what a wonderful idea for a movie if you are a complete manic depressive psycho idiot neo nazi that is this movie is over 2 hours long and it is a shame because in my busy life i just lost over 2 hours of my weekend i kept waiting for the movie to show me its purpose this is the absolute worst movie i have ever seen i guess the writer relates to the characters i am proud to say i do not and if many people do relate to the brainwashed psycopaths in this movie then society is in big trouble this movie can only accomplish 2 things waste your time or convince really stupid people that are on the edge to blow up buildings and deliver pain i walked away from this movie angry that someone could spend $50 million making it dont waste your timethere are a lot of highly talented filmmakersactors in the united states now none of them are associated with this movie why in the world do producers actually invest money in something like this this you could have made 10 good films with the budget of this garbage its not entertaining to have seven grown men running around as dorks pretending to be funny what is funny though is that the films producer who happens to be the oldest guy of the bunch is playing the youngest dork the film is filled with moments that scream for captions saying youre supposed to laugh now its hard to believe that this craps supposed to be a comedy many people actually stood up and left the cinema 30 minutes into the movie i should have done the same instead of wasting my time painthere is no arguing that fight club was an allegory to 911 the taliban wanted to prove to america that its fascist capitalist socialist approach to consumerism that they would take down the buildings that were held in high regard to americans tyler durden and his schizophrenic friend brad pitts character set off to destroy the capitalist america by taking down major banks through soap bombs i dont want to go into more detail for fear that the government will take me away you can look it up on google and read the in depth analysis by people who were taken away the chicks tits were bomb even though they were cgi i liked the part where brad pitts character spliced penises into the movie reel and the 12 year old girl was crying because it was bigger than her dads make sure to check where your soap was madethis film has to be different then the book i notice the production cost and theater gross are way off which is what makes the most sense of this film this makes kubricks 2001 a masterpiece criminals should have time taken off their sentence if they can sit through this more then once some great movies do need to be seen 2 or 3 times to understand everything and it is worth it obviously not this someone thought they were being real dynamic deep brilliant putting this thing together when they were on lsd it seemed like the answer to the meaning of life when they came down it was silly nonsense too late the film was in the can it belongs in an ashcan i am sure there are many people who put this in a cult classic category they are on drugs and not even watching it the film actually would have been much better if it was another underground fight movie without the way overboard trying to be deep and multi faceted art it is not the high school chemistry did nothing to help the film the subliminal message before the credits was probably aimed at people who spent money to see it you got the shaft it sucks and others which cannot be printed herethis film is the one of the worst uses of celluloid ive seen no plot acting by ed norton brad i cant act pitt and others off the mark its just plain lame its herky jerkythe new way to make filmsjust film a series of crazy mixed up scenes and teenagers dig it this can only be described as a teenagers angst filmsocietys out to get me so form a fight club to strike back forget this filmunless youre 16 and feeling badthis film starts off well and keeps you interested until about half way through in the second half of the film the storyline goes all over the place and when you realise whats actually going on then you realise how ridiculous it all is as a result the film loses all credibility and youre just left feeling cheated whereas with other promising bad films the problem is usually that the basic idea for the plot is good and they are simply badly executed like the sixth sense  here the main idea is absurd and is also executed badly the only good things in this film are the acting and the camerawork which is admittedly good but for a good film you need a good plot not a ridiculous one all in all very bad not worth watching and certainly doesnt deserve to be anywhere in the list of best 250 films avoid at all cost will leave you feeling disillusionedthis has got to be one of the most overrated movies of alltime oooh it was all in his mind how original no one has ever thought of that before obviously i am being sarcastic this movie was so boring that i could only get about halfway through it before having to stop and only later did i get around to watching the second half that was a mistake it was as utterly pointless and uninteresting in the second half as it was in the first this is a classic example of a movie being popular simply because it was trendy for people to say that they liked it and brad pitt give me a break the guy is a hack only a star because of his looks he simply cant actthis highly pretentious film is written by an intellectual weakling designed for those to aspire to this the plot makes no sense and the clever finale is drivel to absorb any meaning from this would require the classic media studies student who used to not understanding and undeservedly praising most cretinous films takes this abstract twist to be a clever comment on the state of society or something of the sort in term of enjoyment fight club undoubtedly gets a 0 surely even for those supposedly engrossed in the nonsensical intricacies of it and a small role from meat loaf heightens the sense of disappointment in conjunction with a slight feeling of nausea avoid at all coststhis is easily one of the worst films ever created the beginning i must admit is different and quite intriguing i mean who would have ever thought of a guy who is addicted to 12 step programs but the minute that brad pitts face hits the screen we are soon forced into mind numbing senseless violent trash i think that violence must be used for a purpose such in reserviour dogs or raging bull in these movies we see violence as a tool to push the desperation and hopelessness of the main characters in fight club we see violence as a tool to drive along a bunch of nonsense possibly the only reason i could see for all of the fights was for the male characters to bring out their pent up freudian fantasies for violence if you want an immature movie where men beat the cp out of each other for no reason then go ahead bon appetite but if you want a movie that has any intelligence or sense of reality then please do your self a favor and spend your money elsewherethis is possibly the worst movie ive ever seen i hear its supposed to appeal to my generation im 22 since weve been brought up on a diet of senseless violence and mtv now i dont automatically think theres anything wrong with violence in movies as long as theres some justification for it and i like watching mtv when they actually play videos but i found this film terrible up until about the middle of the movie there might have been a chance for this movie to find itself and deliver some real social commentary which is the only possible reason other then pure sick voyeurism that might justify the horrific violence unfortunately fight club then took a turn for the worse not for the better and delivered an even more bizarre more violent ending save your money somethinganythingon tv or at the $175 movie theater is better than thisthis is the worst piece of trash ive seen in many a long year ive seen comments that the movie presents the shallowness and hypocrisy of the squares all around us and offers a way out through the infliction and receipt of pain in bareknuckled brawling with consenting partners sorry i cant see it that way all i see is a tiresome and unappetizing jerk who turns into a tiresome masochist with bruises there is nothing liberating in this piece of trash there is only an inauthentic jerk who turns into a more disagreeable inauthentic jerk given that it takes a lot of money and a lot of talented people to make a movie like this its incomprehensible how this piece of trash like this ever got made and even more incomprehensible how any sane and intelligent critic could find any redeeming qualities in it if the movie demonstrates anything its that lunacy and tastelessness has taken over the inmates are in charge and were all living in a lunatic asylumthis movie deliberately deceives you like with a good fraudster there are many positive aspects immaculate acting and visuals positive messages eg there is enormous potential within your self  free it good pacing a nice story twist which seems not to be based on any significant holes in the story line and abundant food for thought all this pales against what appears to be the main and effectively only concern of the movie glorification of a herrenmenschenfascistwomanhatingsadistic type of male homosexuality there is still much to improve in our societies for gay people and this movie does respective efforts not any good to say the least most disturbingly one can observe this tendency in the female lead which is cast as a sex and brainless ragdoll useful only for the release of sexual aggression which she actually likes and deserves because she is a predator posing as a pet  a role model for women in general the final scene does not imply anything else because in the end it is taylor who prevails  as can be inferred by his last spliceinthis movie doesnt know exactly what it wants the movie is very slow on pace i actually like the kind of movies that first try to build the characters and make you delve into the atmosphere this movie wasnt building any character or atmosphere but what it was building is total boredom i didnt want to watch this movie till the end but then i thought about the high points that people have given it and some of the reviewers were talking about its great twist ending but the ending alone couldnt save the 90% of this movies boredom i really feel cheated i want my money and above all 139 min of my life back that i wasted on this crap my advice to you people who havent seen this movie please dont waste your valuable resources on this crapthis movie is a well crafted exciting and ultimately thoughtless piece of propaganda like potemkin triumph of the will or birth of a nation it advances certain ideas that we are all slaves to consumerism and have no choice but to buy products advertised to us which we must revolt against by beating people up and exploding buildings and argues them with images rather then words in historical context it will be seen alongside the wto and imf riots and the rise of the green party like most propaganda a closer inspection will reveal how full of hypocrisy it is  notice all the product placementsthis movie is not that good after seeing this movie i wouldnt ever pay cash money to see this again i will never rent this movie again i probably wouldnt watch it on tv if it came on its really that bad $350 is not worth watching this movie do not rent it it is awful my reason for this opinion is the fact that it doesnt make sense in most scenes the part where hes burning his hand is fairly impossible the ending is really bad i mean its so bad that i almost threw a flower pot at the tv screen and dont be misled by the title its not really about a fight club its about something more absurd edward norton did the best job he could with this lousy script and even brad pitt did a mediocre job the surprise ending is nothing like the sixth sense id rather see that movie twenty more times rather than see 5 minutes from fight club ive read some comments about this movie and i dont know what you guys are talking about its not that good some plot twists does not make for good movie making this movie is on the level of judge dredd no wait judge dredd isnt this badthis movie is very very very times 10 to the 100th power bad i mean come on brad pit and edward norton in a fight id rather watch a pokemon fight then those two weak fruity actors fight but brad was ok in ocean 11 and 12 monkeys plus the whole plot is just way over the top it tries to appeal to a smart audience but i think it can only appeal to a dumb one this film total insults capitalism and america it tries to make some political statements but it is just a 2 hour piece of garbage i should have known better than to rent this weak movie the movie cover simply has a picture of a bar of pink soap that should have told me not to watch it but since the reviews were kind of good i rented it anyway thats the last time i watch something with a piece of pink soap on the movie covertwo great movies in my opinion are the game and seven both directed by david fincher so obviously i went into fight club wanting to love it and i did well the first half anyway from there on it went straight downhill into just another hollywoodproduced uncreative clonemovie i could go in and pinpoint the exact frame where the film turns from an intriguing smart drama into an unimaginitive hybrid of two of the worst movies that ive seen the matrix and dark city all three of these movies seem to have a common newage theme they all convey the message the individual can do anything and as long as they don t seek aid from an outside source their power is limitless maybe these antiestablishment  antireligion ideals are just a faze in modern media but it could also be the direction the industry will be heading in the future as for fight club on its own brad pitt and edward norton play their parts well and the movie does have some redeeming elements but overall i cant recommend it but dont let that dissuade you from seeing the movie id never say dont see this movie you should always see the movie to have an opinion of your own just watch this one with your eyes opentypically overdirected david fincher nonsenseis he actually able to direct a movie that isnt dank grimy and depressing there are way to many people out there who hold this claptrap in too high regard perhaps they confuse the muddled and selfcongratulatory rubbish that is the plot for something deep and meaningful i found that this film scrapes the bottom of the barrel for reasons to be cynical and faithless it became increasingly obnoxious and irritating edward nortons character had the most annoying voice and the constant ugly imagery turned me off totally if this film wanted to poke fun at our society then why did it only show all the ugly parts granted there is a lot of fake unnatural beauty out there but a helluva lot of this world is still free and nice to look at not everywhere is a dull grey office or a miserable rainy alleyway it is also very very slow 139 minutes have never seemed so longa lot of this film could have been cut out and still there would be no major difference to the story i like the idea that everyone is part of the same gang and by sticking together they can easily bring down modern society this should have been exploited more but we only get about 4 or 5 scenes of their antics but the whole thing of the gang becoming fascists in their attempt to stop fascism is lost on me i didnt find it ironic subtle or meaningful sorry the subtext about man becoming primal again and releasing all the rage created from jobs that insult their intelligence and ruin their lives is lost on me too its practically nonexistent i have never been let down so much by a movie that was hyped as being exciting it was really rather boring the dvd has a loads of features annoying and headache inducing why did fox insist on a dozen little featurettes instead of one healthy hourlong documentary the menus are confusing as is the multiangle function on the 5minute scene deconstructions who on earth is going to watch all of these 2 or 3 times just to see the different angles and bad camcorder shots of someone working on a computer the movie itself is in dolby 51 and is anamorphically enhanced at 2401uninteresting clichÌ©d look at capitalism moralism and human natureyadda yadda yadda i think the appeal to the masses must be the cool rebel element i just found that boring and senseless pitt and norton are fine and actually necessary for the film to even be watchable roger ebert said it best women who have had a lifetime of practice at dealing with little boy posturing will instinctively see through itwhat was this this was stupidwhat was going on i am going to warn you right now that if like me you were hoping to learn about soap by watching this movie you will be sorely disappointed their house was totally dirty and had bad electricity there was one point in this movie when i sat on the remote and accidentally changed the channel to the real housewives of new jersey and i didnt even notice its basically the same premise somebody is in front of the camera doing something and somebody else is all oh no uhhhh you cant do thathere im sorry if you liked this movie but it means that youre stupid why are you so stupid stop itwhen the movie was half way through all my friends wanted to turn it off i refused because i had heard it was a fantastic ending we saw the movie through but it only got worse i cant see anything uplifting about this movie id rather see the matrixwhy oh why do i give david fincher a second chance my mind always wanders when watching his films and pictures him at various moments over say 2 months writing his little ideas down as they come to him this movie is clearly the culmination of about 20 of those ideas and some that were brought back from the waste paper basket strung together with thread bare plotting oh and please david give your set designer the day off for the next one heshes needed at a new theme park to do the haunted house 2 out of 10 1 for the lead actors who give it there best and 1 for brad pitts bum cleavage that gave the movie its best tooyes these days its hard to single out a movie as exceedingly dumb when people rave about crap like pulp fiction and the matrix but this must take a special prize at least in this case this qualifies as a so bad its good exercise whereas the others were just mindless bores of course its largely thanks to the incredibly bad acting of ed norton and brad pitt who should form a triumvirate with keanu reeves as the most overpaid talentless bunch of numbnuts ever to grace the screen with their lack of talent in fact the only good performance here is by meatloaf which is saying a lot if you think the plot is original its not the same idea was presented in a half hour episode of alfred hitchcock presents over 30 years ago that was directed by the master himself still even if it was faked i did greatly enjoy seeing pitt and norton beating each other to a bloody pulp they both certainly deserve it for their past and future workyes this movie is quite different however aside from the possibility that no ones done it before because they werent smartinspiredgood enough to theres also the other one this is a movie that fails so remarkably you almost have to be a genius to come up with such a failure in the one excellent scene in this movie edward norton flying on a plane from one of his constant business trips cracks a joke to his neighbour brad pitt aka tyler durden here very clever pitt replies how is that going for you that is both funny and poignant the rest of the movie however is neither in fact its just the same as poor ed norton  too clever for its own good worse yet is the reaction this movie seems to cause many of the others commented and other people whove seen this movie think that tyler durden is somehow the voice of good a positive role model if you will and some people are completely nuts about this movie they quote it day and night and i dont know its just weird and then theres the ending i cant give it away but the best thing that i can say about it is that it is gimmicky its also pretty implausible doesnt fit with the rest of the story and involves blowing up skyscrapers something we now know is not a very good idea if youre going to make a clever movie with a clever surprise ending fine its possible to make a good one  the usual suspects for example but having a clever movie that isnt clever enough to make sure the movie still makes any sense when the ending is revealed a clever movie whose message is how empty cleverness is a clever message movie where the message is delivered by someone whos obviously shall we say not very emotionallymentally stable to say the least i guess you could say its irony but then with the same success you can say that domestic disturbance is a movie that makes one think cause it makes you think what the heck youre doing watchingpaying for such an awful movie having said all that this is a movie that could have been partially rescued by having a lead actress who is stunningly beautiful unfortunately helena bonham carter isnt okay maybe its not the most overrated movie on imdb  after all the shwshank redemption is ranked #2 and kingpin is not even on the bottom 100 at all but its pretty close 110 and that high only cause it took so much effortyes this movie is quite different however aside from the possibility that no ones done it before because they werent

the most overrated movie on imdb  after all the shawshank redemption is ranked #2 and kingpin is not even on the bottom 100 at all but its pretty close 110 and that high only cause it took so much effortthis two hour version is a terrible war movie very violent and i wouldnt want my kids to go through what we went through watching these six piles of garbage the empire strikes back 30 minute version that garry hixon put in his files after innerspace is really really a masterpiece unfortun ately disney would not allow it to actually be released i only get about 30 hits a day on my 4 videos and im sorry to say dont have the money to release too many more but theres always hope i really enjoyed the experience in 1980 but i was a dumb kid stoned on marijuana and acid the computer graphics were very avante garde at the time its definitely a love story compared to my version but is is very long and very boring there version of the force is levitation which is not the force the force is feeling it feeling it and not using the ability too often then levitation is possible thank you disney love cinderellaand poor characterization as a technical achievement its a masterpiece as a work of drama its mediocre to lame the dialogue scenes were overwrought with drama much like a soap opera although instead of sappy hammond organ music we had the sappy orchestral score rising and falling on practically every syllable jackson deserves a lot of points for his technical skills but none for his artistryi dont get the point with all that 11 oscars 9 10 on imdb but what this is sensed to be something artistic some postal card landscapes and ridiculous one liners damn try to be intelligent scenes about loyalty and all there is nothing in this movie nor in the two others that can let me say it is a good movie no plot no acting no directing there is nothing in this movie and i dont post that to provoke reactions i truly think it and i dont understand to be so isolated with this point of view there are well done heroic fantasy movies like conan the barbarian that are seen like average movies and this is put on a podium i hope im not the only one it makes wanna pukei have seen a lot of movies made from computer programs lara croft etc however this computer generated cartoon beats them all no nobody really gave a great performance individually or they would have got a nomination and won it no doubt but the graphics oh man they almost looked like a real movie being shot moreover the special effects were incredible i can see why this movie won seven oscars for special effects alone i mean you have to give it to this movie it had some great special effects oh sure the acting was overdone and a bit sappy but man get a look at the special effects here i mean it won 11 oscars so i guess it must be the best film ever even though nobody from the film was acknowledged for their performance because nobody was really great in it but man the special effects here outstanding hey a billion geeks cant be wrong if you are a tolkien fan i guess this is as good as it gets for the rest of us its just another movie and a fairly peculiar one imagine star wars return of the jedi without an appearance by darth vader or the evil emperor thats what you get here a struggle between good and evil with the leaders of the evil hordes conspicuously absent its quite strange then theres the consistent theme that the better looking you are the better your character is dr king convinced me that it was the content of my character that counted not my appearance but in all three movies of this trilogy the two go together quite closely its an old hollywood theme but not particularly to be admired as for aragorn preferring arwen to eowen i suppose there is just no accounting for taste and im sure it is faithful to the author and what can one say about the seemingly endless multiple endings not very dramatic but perhaps more interesting than the usual single climactic ending so on the whole i find the return of the king a watchable film but hardly one of the greatest of all time eleven oscars i guess it must have been a bad year for movies now that you mention it theres been a lot of those in recent years the story was ruined the ending was drawn out the whole movie was shot in this ridiculous this story is so epic i will pan around and everything will seem really dramatic even when there is no real action way it was like a parody of itself i can hardly believe people could find any of the worth of the novels in this self aggrandizing trilogy i only paid $3 to see this film and was wishing for my money back after what shouldve been the final scene of the movie there was this fake 10 minute ending where thousands of people simply cheered on screen it was such a blatant way of telling people the fabulous movie the tremendous trilogy is over lets all celebrate it was terribleman fellowship was much better than this piece of junk a lot of the shots were horrible the cgi except for gollum sucked the dialogue was beyond cheesy the battles were anti climatic the way the war ended w the dead people was dumb the ending dragged on and on and on i checked my watch at least 15 times during this movie the battle scenes blah and if the fate of the world is in your hands and your supposedly out numbered why freakin joke while your fighting and putting notches on your belt thats just so freakin lame the attempts at comedy in this movie were laughable if you want to watch a movie w real battle scenes do yourself a favor and go see last samurai ive seen that movie 2 times and im going to have to see it again to get the bad taste out of my mouth that is rotklord of the rings is an overlong piece of crap from one of the biggest hacks in hollywood peter jackson used to make low budget horror films that were amazing now he makes big hollywood movies with big hollywood stars his aim now isnt to make good movies his aim is now to make as much money as he can why cant hollywood start making films that are actually good instead of films that they make to reel in cash who needs so much money why does peter jackson need more money seriously peter jackson needs to stop making movies he ruined king kong recently and he made three films that are entirely too long based on a crappy overlong series get this film off the top 250 of all time it suckswithout the use of computer graphics this film would not be worth the price of a cheap bargain day 3 for 1 special rental at the local video store true the locations and cinematography add to the film however heaven forbid that the cast should either have to act or in the case of the veteran actors overact cg removed and this thespian in name only grouping are woefully short of the depth and quality characterization brought forth in the classic book the direction is sporadic and the pace is inconsistent leaving little to the imagination why so much of the budget was spent on computer technicians instead of acting lessons sorry for all those who jumped on the lemming band wagon for this one but lift your heads above middle earth and return to the land of the livingtheres nothing deep or important going on here so a critique of this film is almost unnecessary what passes for quality film making is nothing more than an overproduced loud stunning imax experiment in eye candy that masks once again a slowly moving thin story line obviously the members of sag have dispensed with background checks on film editors theres enough slow motion footage here to circumnavigate the globe twice many people will be amazed by the neverending in your face action sequences but for those who still pine to see the actors perform also youd better search elsewhere its like trying to read the latin version of war and peace while simultaneously being pulverized inside a blender and if having way too many computerized fight scenes forced down your throat wasnt enough just wait the full ninety hours for the saccharine glazed overlit endings and there are at least 5 of them for a while i was expectin obi wan kenobis ghost to show up and smile goodbye and cate blanchett never looked so vapid its brass tacky loud long obvious schlock and thus hugely popular beautiful looking rarely translates to quality in content and this is a prime example giving so many awards to this fillibuster is just a waste of gold plating if you make your way through the thousands of teens lord of the rings junkies and all the others who voted this movie a 10 for reasons other than a pure movie rating youll find that this is easily the weakest of the three films unfortunately pro it was a good movie and for the most part entertaining the characters are well cast the cgi is good in most places the actors are good enough to save questionable editing and the scenery is still breathtaking great effects in battle youll see worth the $10 to see but not really one you want to see again without having the ability to skip portions cons 1 way way too long and poor editing choices spoiler the multiple endings was totally preposterous and belongs in the extended dvd version for fanzies remember this is a movie not the book that time would have been much better spent on main characters that never surfaced eg saruman whom you never saw again and sauron who was reduced to nothing more than a lighthouse oh yeah i felt how dangerous he was you will get restless at the end of the movie and will laugh your head off as to how awfully campy and forced it feels especially when frodo wakes up and the silly canned laughter begins 2 too much time wasted at the beginning of the film as well mr jackson pick your choices of what to develop the love story and relationship between get any concern for the relationship too bad too much crap with merry and pippin please enough of the hobbit details crap and focus on the main characters honestly i didnt feel like i really cared so much about many of the characters because there was so much cutting between scenes and an incredible amount of time spent on faramir and his going mad father an odd area to place so much time 3 gimli and legolas again reduced to nothing more than comic relief and incredibly cool and unrealistic cgi hero there was practically no dialogue with legolas at all the reduction of these characters made me care less about legolas and made the girl i went with happy the one or two time she saw him but wondered why he was nothing but occasional screen candy 4 the movie felt very tired gollum again steals the show 5 some of the battle scenes were tired a lot of quick cutaways and not as much feel of the one on one combat like you had in the first films also very very poor display assistance of the dead it was as though they used up the budget for cgi and had this wave of green just end the huge number of saurons army in 10 seconds while the other characters hung out to chat it was like a comic strip video game honestly i didnt feel like i really cared so much about the characters at the end and felt like the ring was reduced to nothing more than an overblown reason to have a quest i truly think this movie suffers from wasted time at the beginning and end too many battle scenes and too little time to continue to develop the great dialogue and character development of earlier movies my rating would place this film a very good 75 but that is as high as id go definitely bring some nourishment wear comfy clothes and a watchif the first film bored you to tears and the second one bored you to death the third film will not affect you because you are now numb and totally disinterested we have even more of those pointless scenes with sam and frodo more battles and more cgi and how many endings can a film have theres a huge battle and then they tell you there is another one and its still not over because there are a million loose ends and then they go back home and then bilbo leaves home and then sam has children is that the end or is there more i cant even remember i fell asleep during one of the particularly tedious scenes with sam and frodo this is not a film its a pointless sequence of scenes and an exercise in cgi that resembles a video game one you can only watch but not play and i still dont care about a single bloody character in this film this film is bad in the sense that it is hardly a film at all it has no structure no dialogue no screenplay a threadbare story but one that is not told because of non existent direction etc it continues where the original left off and just notches off plot elements one by one without any urge to tell a story or develop characters relationships etc the makers probably conceived this as a filler between numbers one and three and didnt bother with it of course thats all right i dont have any problem with that but what really does disturb me is the high praise meted out to this film from almost every quarter äóñ from viewers and critics alike on this board its being rated as the 17th best movie of all time ive consulted quite a few film guides and they all tag maximum or near maximum stars to this film even more bizarrely they consider it to be the best of the series and in my mind its clearly the worst what is going on of course its not difficult to see why this film is idolized the first film was both good and a milestone not great but it was the perfect statement for an age it was a fairy tale that was confused as science fiction the force embodied morality even religion for the space age it is set in the distant past and therefore pertains to origins rather than where technology is going spaceships and laser guns are just the backdrop and have nothing to do with the story or the subject matter when this film appeared in the middle of the crisis ridden seventies it really must have been a beacon of new hope and to put the ground breaking special effects into its proper context they symbolized optimism there is no doubt that the effects served the story well but they served even better the mood of the age and with all this going star wars rightly became a tremendous hit and the focus of fanatic devotion it was to be expected that any sequel would have been gobbled up by the fan base as long as it didnt spoil the original empire doesnt spoil the original it not only continues the war between good and evil it does so with more spectacle more aplomb more special effects when people say they like empire what i think they really mean is that thy like star wars so much that they are thrilled that it has a new and glossy wrapping because empire is nothing but embellishment theyre not judging the film itself the ideal situation would have been if star wars remained as a standalone fairy tale fairy tales end and they leave us with the aura of happily ever after they dont go on and on and become sagas and if they did that would totally destroy the aura empire is the first mistaken step towards saga and that is why it quickly finds itself out of its depth there is nothing else to be told and thats why the film is so bad one boring battle joined to another boring battle and in between we have cardboard characters mouthing atrocious dialogue that serves no purpose whatsoever the strain tells everybody is straining to do something when there is nothing to do the third film the return of the jedi redeems itself by trying to finish a story the prequels are interesting because they are filling in the background but empire is caught in no mans land it is bad and it should be exposed as such all this pretending isnt healthy i dont think obviously this was a faithless and pointless butchering of the novel but whats worse a terrible movie lacking flow sense linearity and dramatic impact this played out like a highlights reel not a coherent story the actors did an admirable job with the awful dialogue and nosensical personalities they were given with some exceptions peter jacksons only two abilities seem to lie in super close up and super wide out shots both of which are heartily abused and the special effects for the most part would have been better served by a cardboard set and some directing ability there were high points but this was and is the first and only movie i have ever left before the end and they barely kept me there but for the eowyn nazgul scene a hollywood blockbuster no doubt a good movie hell no possessing anything in common with the literature it is supposedly based on the fact is if this were based on real events i dont think the people involved would have given them to right to use their real names maybe that wouldnt be such a big deal if i didnt have to hear about jacksons love of the books or read reviews that discuss staying true to the source material there is hardly a scene or underlying theme in the movie that has anything to do with the books this movie could probably have been worse but i would be hard pressed to know howtalk about a bad mainstream movie bad acting and terrible choices of scenes to have in the movie by peter jackson its a shame its on the 2th place when great movies like lost in translation is much further down sure the movie contains some really great effects and some okay acting but i mean the end oh my god was it really necessary to have 4 ending scenes if you still like these kind of movies why dont you guys go and see star wars at least their acting and characters is a lot more fun and those movies are also contains nice scenes relating to the time they were made this shouldnt be seen as an offense to either peter jackson nor tolkien because they are both great but still the movie didnt really work out ickash okay i realize that this movie is considered by many to be a great film i understand that they are extremely faithful to the novels and this pleases many fans what i do not understand is how anyone can say this film is better than the godfather ii and even one spot away from the first godfather go take a gander at the imdbs top 250 and youll see that this movie is only marginally below the shawshank redemption i mean cmon someones gotta figure out a way to balance the rating system here all thats going on is these movies cult of scary and weird followers sit in their dank cold basements on the internet and vote these films a 10 when in the grand scheme of things theyre really more of a 6 7 or maybe an 8 im sorry but no matter how great these movies may seem theyre little more than a cgi fest of monsters armies and magical beams this film cant hold a candle to the intense drama of michael corleones criminal empire holding power in 1950s las vegas cmon imdb viewers lets keep the ratings reasonable this movie is not great its barley border line good the only two reason i cant think this was rated so high was the extremely high budget on 3d animation and the fact that people are so easily enticed by the name and actors now i am not insulting the books as i have never read them but other than what i stated what makes this movie so great is it the acting i dont really think orlando bloom can preform any other role take a look at both the lord of the rings and pirates of the caribbean is it climax i think even the people who didnt even read the book knew that from the first half of the first movie knew that the ring would be destroyed is it the characters it had all the basic characters for all movie storyline the only entertaining and not bland character was golem what is it that makes you think its in the league with schindlers list and casablanca i dont claim to know what the best movie ever is but i know this movie dose not rank high in greatness it only high in its budget not being a dork or geek the mystique of these movies are lost on me so here is a review from someone that actually had dates in high school and didnt play d&d every friday night long lame sword fights to win a sword fight with the orcs all you need to so is step aside and cut them across the chest then as an alternate you can spin and run your opponent through i figure me and four other people could effectively wipe out a million of these lame fighters for this reason alone i give the movie a thumbs down the special effects were perhaps the best ive ever seen great monsters and landscapes is it just me or were most of the characters in this story gay just look at the way froddo looks at sam and vice versa pure lust in their eyes then there was this albino vulcan who always made double entandres toward a midget with a big nose he was obviously gay then there was the way gondorf kept touching the hobbits is this guy a priest anyway i give this movie a thumbs down it had the longest ending of any movie ive seen people were saying it it over yet but no it kept on going and going like the energizer easter bunny peter jackson is purely b list in my opinion there thats from a cool guy later this film won 11 oscars including best picture the return of the king is an awful film at well over three hours it is an exercise in boredom orlando bloom and viggo moretensen are completely miscast the story does not make sense and the characters are contrived it is like playing a bad video game so many actors are wasted in this colassal disaster peter jackson winner of the best director academy award seems as though he thought that his film was too precious to edit the film goes on and on and on weak acting all around the film relies on special effects to cover for a script that is completely pretentious the musical score is like listening to someone scratching a chalkboardthis movie was terrible long and boring both my wife and i hated it i love star wars the old ones i am told i am just not a fantasy fan but i think i am just not a fan of badly done commercialized fantasy if i want to see a documentary on new zeland landscape i will rent it the movie should tell a compelling story with 20 characters and none of them even close to well developed i had no attachment to any of them yes i did not read the books i actually read the hobbit as a kid and loved it and remember it well i think they were just too true to the books and didnt realize that the books dont make a good movie unless you have read and loved the books call me the grinch i am not harsh on most movies all my friends love this movie and are avid fans i have no idea how it is anywhere in the top 250 maybe i could say this is a decent flick if you have nothing mildly stimulating to watch some weekend or need a decent rental my wife walked out of this movie i bared through it in the theaters just to give it a chance i would never rent it dont bother dragonslayer from back in the day does it much better and with triple the drama and action while the first two films of the trilogy where very good in my opinion the third one is a complete catastrophe in every aspect one can think of its attitude towards the book and without the book no one would have heard of peter jackson except few admirers moves between insult to ignorance almost no text from the original survives and the characters and scenes are terribly distorted even the climax scene is changed from the genius of tolkien to a bad holiwoodic clichÜ© the most disastrous is what the movie does to the character of frodo which from the original tragic hero becomes a stupid and gullible fellow which does nothing expect stupid things the go home sam scene should be candidate to one of the worse movie scenes ever other characters such as denethor faramir aragorn theoden or elrond are either inconsistent irrational stupid badly acted or all of the above in addition unlike the beautiful design of the middle earth in general in the first movie or of rohan in second there is nothing left from gondor except one picture of minas tirith and few fires it amazes me that not only this film is considered excellent by many viewers but that it is considered the best of the three i went to see rotk for the 2nd time yesterday and aside from the myriad of minor flaws want to concentrate on major issues surrounding jacksons character development aragorn is the first big problem in the book he is both a ranger from the north but also a man destined to be king he knows who he is and he has an expectation of that destiny likewise in the book he has spiritual awareness aragorn is descended not merely from men but from numenor so he already has in him some of the blood of the elves now jackson gives all foresight to the elves making the men merely men but the whole point is that the man born to be king has the spiritual awareness of the great kings of old thus in book ii at the river it is aragorn not legolas as in jacksons version who is aware of a shadow growing in his heart and more significantly it is aragorn who in the book takes the palantir by his right gandalf actually bows to give it to him gandalf counsels him not to use it but aragorn knows who he is so he looks in the palantir and shows sauron the sword he challenges sauron and then wrenches the palantir away from the eye to use as he wills not as sauron wills in so doing he sees the black fleet and so knows the threat thats why he takes the path of the dead and when he goes under the dimholt he really summons the dead the exchange in the film between aragorn and the geoffrey rush pirates of the caribbean look alike ghost is feeble in the film in the book aragorn does not doubt who he is he calls them not barters with them now aragorns action here is part of a much larger cohesion in tolkien that is entirely absent in jackson as a result were left with a desperately anti climactic coronation why theres simply been no character development of aragorn hes been denuded of a sense of who he is sauron is the next big problem its true that in the book he is mostly referred to as the eye but he also has personality in the film apart from the opening sequence to film i which was brilliant all we have is a plasma lamp sometime searchlight since in the book gandalf has told frodo that sauron is taking shape again why on earth didnt jackson then develop sauron from the figure in film i in the book we are told of saurons gnawing doubt we hear of reports about spies entering mordor we know that he is consumed by fear of the upstart heir of elendil none of this is developed in the film and the ring seems to lose power on entering mordor not gain it result there was no sense of elation at the fall of baraddur now this is a serious theological error that i suspect tolkien would have detested personify good and you must also personify evil tolkiens epic was all about those forces being personified and how you discern them sauron is a personification of evil hes not actually the worst that belongs to morgoth of whom the balrog is a servant whilst tolkien rightly loathed allegory he nonetheless never would have countenanced such a weak and ineffectual portrayal of the enemy the whole point and if this isnt obvious in the world today then jackson is even less astute than i imagined is that evil in many guises takes human form others the same lack of characterisation in aragorn and sauron goes on with many of the others notable exceptions are gandalf and saruman both well acted jackson made a mistake in cutting saruman out of iii having made so much of him in i and ii more than the book arwen is drippy throughout eowyn is changed in the film miranda otto was excellent but jackson plays up the love between her and aragorn so much that we are left wondering how eowyn is apparently beatifically happy to see him with arwen on the subject of eowyn its such a shame jackson didnt do the slaying of the witch king better in the book the battlefield pauses a cloud goes up and everyone in minas tirith is happy its one of the truly great moments lost by jackson the reports even leak back to the orcs in the tower above shelobs lair so that sam and frodo hear that no1 has been done in as for the hobbits i think this may be a question of preference personally i think sean astins acting as sam is execrable but some like it for me the simple gardener becomes a mini philosopher and i find his soliloquy both at the end of film ii in osgiliath to which they never go in the book and on the mountain twice truly toe curlingly dreadful pap im afraid and oh dear we even veered towards titanic music moments at the end of film i and again on the mountain bilbo was fine until the end yes we know he ages fast now hes lost the ring but the salieri style prosthetics are poor jackson loves the slow motion work so much that we have to endure some particularly dreadful sequences with the hobbits most notably the already infamous bed scene and at the end where i really thought frodo was going to give sam a full on smacker a similarly tacky piece of directing occurs when the elves appear the soft focus lens is deployed with celtic singing argh this is kindergarten film production i expect the film will garner the oscars ceremony but i hope some people in tinsel town have the courage to acknowledge that whilst some of the visuals are outstanding though many are not eg the oliphaunt descent by legolas the merrick style leader of the orcs and the army of the dead the film is not actually very good peter im afraid youve let us and jrr tolkien downmany people justify jacksons drivel by saying that everyone interprets the books differently jackson however not only adapted tolkiens story but created his own he removed tolkiens dialogue and replaced it with hackneyed banter he replaced scenes of drama and suspense with slapstick and hamboning the majesty and dignity of characters such as gimli aragorn sam frodo gollum and theoden almost all the characters really are reduced to snivelling whimpering and slapstick jokes arwen elrond and galadriel the most noble characters in the series are reduced to whimpering fools the disrespect that jackson shows for the characters makes clear the lack of interest he has in faithfully presenting tolkiens work tolkien after all related to his characters so closely that he had their names engraved on his own tombstone it is insulting to tolkiens memory to deal with his characters with such irreverence considering how much he cared about them its insulting to tolkiens memory while many dispute this i find the movies to be amateurish and the special effects are mediocre considering the heights of computer generated effects that other studios have reacheddespite the rave reviews it gets making a mediocre movie isnt really a sin in itself making a bad movie and claiming that it has any relationship to tolkiens work however is movie gets one star out of ten but its more deserving of zero that people have read tolkiens book and yet find any similarity or value in jacksons movies baffles me they are without merit being poorly made and completely disrespectfully adapted from the books jackson has not merely spit on tolkiens grave he has forever tainted his legacy with his awful interpretation of his work this middle oddity is a very laborious experience indeed its all life saver battles with an added dose of averageness thrown in to pad it out a bit dirk vader is seeking luke shytalker or whatever his name is its something along those lines anyway because he wants to cut him down with a swift blow from his life saver if he does not join him in wanting to rule the galaxy as dull and duller maniacal space duo anyway it all ends with dirk confronting shytalker in a life saver battle to the death dirk swings his life saver at shytalker shytalker swings his life saver back at dirk this goes on until either shytalker gets his hand cut off or the audience dont care anymore thats about it really not much here for real fans empire is nowhere near as good as its predecessor or indeed its sequel jedi both of which are truly engaging this one is notmany critics cite the 1952 film the greatest show of earth as the poorest best picture selection in academy history that dubious distinction should now go to lord of the rings the return of the king which makes demilles circus epic seem like the greatest show on earth in comparison it was not only the academy but also the once relevant new york film critics circle that chose this film as the years best its a wonder that the ghost of pauline kael didnt use her after life influence with the all mighty to strike the entire group dead this video game like film goes from one chase scene to the next with little in the way of plot development ive seen all three films and dont have a clue what the fellowship of the ring is or the significance of the two towers nor where the king was returning from director jackson failed to include much in the way of plot exposition in nine plus hours of film the computer generated gollum was the most interesting character in the film at least he wanted to kill off those annoying hobbits ian mckellen is distinguished in his knightly role and added a touch of class to the otherwise endless stream of special effects the female stars of the film tyler and blanchett have so little screen time that it doesnt make sense to even have them in the film apparently tylers character is present merely to suggest that mortensens character is heterosexual why blanchett has such an annoying smile on her face each fifteen seconds she is on screen is a mystery to meamazing special effects have been used to mask peter jacksons mangling of the original plotline and script warning this film is a prime example of a brilliant book being americanised ie hammered into the boy meets girl girl loses boy boy and girl reunite format it has a couple of elvish words thrown in to preserve an illusion of adhering to the original book but with aragorns american accent often intruding this performance is hardly spell bindingbad acting ok story for the fans but i dont fancy this rpg trend crap i dont know how this movie ever entered the top250 movies of imdb should be ranked #500 best movie of all time or less my real grade for this movie is 60 but i voted it a 10 because lots of mindless people voted it a 10 and no way this boring movie is a 10 special effects dont make a movie a 10 out of 10 go watch the other movies on top10 list like godfather and shawshank redemption and then try to compare it with this piece of okay gandalf aragorn frodo are killed in the first ten minutes and sauron is king again that would be a good ending but no it drags on for another 3 hours and in the end everything is well and all goals are reached in between there are many fighting scenes where you easely get confused who is fighting against who and what exactly for the fighting is overdone and in all battles the good guys win boring and predictable the strongest warrior of the bad guys is defeated by an average female warrior it could do with some more drama it is evident from all 3 movies together that its a story about the eternal fight between good and bad but in these movies its never really explained why exactly the bad guys hate the good guys whats even more disturbing is the facial features of the bad vs the groomed faces of the good guys as if the storyline itself simply wasnt strong enough to outline that they are really evil the orcs have disfigured faces disfigured teeth drool and have a hissing voice couldnt jackon portray that a little bit more subtile frodo is attacked by a giant spider who has surprise surprise also a deformed face and only one eye on the left side of the head is this done to make sure 3 year old infants cannot mistake who is the scary bad guy it was ridiculous to see in fact i had trouble hating them at all i just felt sorry for them i understand its a family movie but this blatant deforming is an insult to the intelligence of people then theres the plot and the story it doesnt make any sense theres no explanation why faramir father wants to kill himself and his son or why gandalf or aragorn do not take the ring to mordor but trust it to little frodo who does nothing but squeel cry and hug sam in between why did the fellowship decide to break up and let frodo continue alone with sam while the other stronger fellows try to save peppin and merrin on with this movie gandalf and aragorn guess frodo must be close to his end goal in mordor but is held up by saurons watching eye so decide to launch a distracting attack with the last army the good guys have left what if frodo happened to appear a few hours later or a few days and sauron itself was a huge warrior in movie 1 but now only a flame on a tower why do the thousands of orcs stop fighting when the tower crumble they flee but where to it is just too unbelievable stupid in movie one thousands of orc chase the fellowship in moria only inches away but none of them harm frodo or manage to catch them in movie 2 they ride with 5 horses through 10000 orcs without so much as a scratch in movie 3 gandalf fights the orcs in mordor but suddenly stops for a moment of musing and while the fighting around him continues not an orc touches him or buries his sword in gandalfs white hair ive seen c class horrors that made more sense then theres the last 20 minutes frodo destroyed the ring but the end simply goes on and on and on and on lots of tear jerking twists appear and you simply start shouting please end to the tv screen in utter annoyance no this movie may have won all academy awards it was nominated for but it was a terrible terrible series the thing that saved this last part a little bit was the helicopter view scenery but if i wanna watch helicopter view scenery ill watch national geographic even the epic battles gave me a feeling of been there done that star wars gladiator ben hur they all done the same and most of the time better shot directed edited and more importantly more believable and the directing was awful the cinematography boring and predictable the editing confusing the score predictable the storyline infantile the acting without any exception terrible the lenght insane the events too much for fantasy the cgi effects hokey it is a childs movie a la jungle book it belongs on nickelodeon between spongebob and johnny bravo in fact there oughta be a law against peter jackson movies i said borefest in the summary but that was too kind its a nice series when you are a child but its outright trash if youre an adult the one aspect that made this one better than the other 2 movies is that there is finally and end to the endless walking and talking the ring is destroyed peter jacksons mega project too thankfullywhat an over rated pile of toss oooooooooooh look at the effects oooooooh gollum is so real ooooooooooh id love to have long blond hair and pointy ears shut up you fools why cant people just watch excellent films and appreciate them instead of being tossed around by the wild current of sensationalism and hype all three of the films were at best average adaptations of the book but just because this is the last one it gets the highest rating its a travesty that rubbish like this overtakes actual classic films on an otherwise excellent database and dont get me started on star wars this is fantastic nonsense over produced and under thought bad taste is a far superior film stick with schlock horror jacksonand learn how to tie a tiethis movie is awful the ending was longer than any battle scene the entire final battle was completely meaningless the humans might as well have stood there because the only ones that did any fighting were the ghosts very anti climatic and the ending was about 35 minutes too long even the most hardcore of fans has to agree on those two points the only good part about this movie was the final battle it seemed and then the ghosts came and completely dominated everything therefore making the previous half hour meaningless i want my 3 hours of my life back and also my ten bucks in all the action was meaningless and the movie would have been much better had it been about 2 hours long tops not the strongest of the trilogy a lengthy drawn out conclusion it lacks the heart of the previous two and lapses on awkwardly with trivial and extraneous characters while he focus obviously should have been elsewhere i especially despised that tacky girlpower bit just goes to show directors actually can drag out irrelevant tacked on plot pieces and the ignorant hordes call it epic because hey its really longyou can pee 3 times get popcorn and soda refillsanswer your pagerand not miss anything most of the dialog is redundant expectancies of the end its got to end right however tediously and it is tedious with proper editing this movie could have been condensed into an hour butguess what the whole trilogys been padded so extensively for length so you can pay to see 3 not just 2 filmsits most obvious in this one wow this passes for classic i think it is the worst film ive seen in a long time and ive seen the original star warsthe characters are so annoying and i wished they all died at the end of the film i wised orlando blooms character legalos would be shot in the face with an arrow by lurtz also i think aragon should get a hair cut and have a shave because ll you see is hair also what is up with that little guy gimli he is so annoying he makes little jokes which are not even funny during a supposedly serious film the group always overact about everything what is the point of leglos saying blood has been spilt this night and walking right up to the camera this look very mincy how did it win best film award how did it win any awardalso the other two films were just as bad they could have cut the films lengths by half if they did not put in so much pointless chatter it would also help if they had real actors and did not rely on cgi so much the whole trilogy achieves to translate admirably well the deep boringness of the book replacing infinite descriptions with long empty tired repetitious and over emotional sequences totally misplaced considering the britney spears like deepness of characters characters are so flat and numerous that you waste half of the movie trying to remember who is who but it doesnt really matter anyway actions sometimes come to wake you up they are mostly entertaining but the most decisive and very awaited one is reduced to a game like greenish flow that is the only thing that happens to be fast in the whole movie be happy the end is near should be rated 5 to 7i dont know what the academy was thinking when it gave the return of the king those 11 awards it did not deserve a single one especially best picture lost in translation mystic river cold mountain and even seabiscuit were all far better those films actually had depth and meaning where as the lord of the rings is just like titanic a bunch of shotty acting and film making covered up with tons of high budget special effects neither film deserved their awards and both in my view are among the most overrated and crappiest films in history i wish the academy would stop choosing the films that are the most popular or will give them the greatest approval ratingits an okay film epic and all of course the fact that its an epic like gladiator or troy doesnt mean its good troy proved that fact and alexander continued to prove it with one star antics to be quite frank peter jackson is an overrated director much like the lord of the rings movies are overrated movies if you notice all three are located in the top fifteen films this one happens to be ranked higher than greatly superiour films such as seven samurai schindlers list and even casablanca this is not the case with camera angles that make you sick utilising the admittedly beautiful landscape of new zealand to help push across into our heads the true epic feeling of middle earth but wait where are the interesting characters every one of them you feel so bored with by the time the first film is up you seem to hope that theyd be dead by the second one but no they come along to the third one to kick some sauron ass heres my view of lord of the rings a whole load of walking lord of the rings fellowship of the ring points there walks lord of the rings the two towers points there walks trips up walks on lord of the rings return of the king points there walks throws ring into mountain walks away take those completely identical scenarios and pile them up with useless plot for three to four hours per movie depending on which one you watch and i myself wouldnt touch the extended versions you really get the idea that the academy awards truly are flawed why look forrest gump won best film of 1994 instead of the shawshank redemption or pulp fiction titanic won best film of 1997 instead of la confidential and why lookey here lotr rotk won best ing film of 2003 instead of mystic river perhaps next year well have the constant gardener as the best film of 2005 that may actually redeem the oscars failing reputation a reputation that had truly fallen when they took this half arsed effort of a movie and worshipped it as best film worse dead movie it is unsatisfactory unethical things it does to your feelings not a good realization of science fiction dumb characters i have seen many good movies my expectation was that this movie would be good but it is not complete waste of time nothing i promise you get from it baseless ambivalent matters runs through the movie i hate and would rate is as the worst one the robot talks too much unnecessary junk talks the monk was not a necessary character disappointed with the relations of princess movie made her unattractive ive waited three years for a disappointing ending the scouring of the shire wasnt in the film and that was by far the most important scene in the story with saruman and wormtongue okay so maybe its in the second dvd comes out after the regular one gets bought up but this is just a marketing scheme the exploitation of a fine story this proves once and for all that literary adaptations are a true rip off of the authors intent fixed only on making large sums of money tolkien is no doubt rolling over in his grave people against this argument no doubt say that well yes but it brings the story to the masses why not encourage them to read instead i feel that the imagination of millions of kids is now ruined because they will never be able to read the books without having wood in their minds as frodo or astin as sam and the characters dont act that way in the book and how can we justify jacksons liberal treatment of the story to promote cgi graphics while disregarding the characters in the film basically the computer is now a character these books should have been left alone this isnt the best film of all time it is the best example of exploitation that has thus far been imagined as someone who read the lord of the rings 15 years back and has been re reading it ever since the movie just takes too many liberties with the plot the scriptwriters have introduced many twists that destroy the story and im sure tolkien would have been horrified if he ever saw this all in all a good action movie but really ruined by some very lousy scriptwriting plot deviations include the entire return to the shire is omitted so as to show the movie concluding with the defeat of sauron which just removes probably the most tragic part of the book frodo manipulated by gollum asks sam to leave him and go home in the climb to shelobs lair faramir decides to take frodo and sam to osgiliathout of nowhere where did the scriptwriters dream this up from and many others too numerous to mention such as tom bombadils scenes being assigned to treebeard awfulthis has to be the most over rated movie ever what a disappointing year first t 3 then matrix revolutions and now return of the king i guess we will never see a 3rd movie better than the first two movies the same thing happened with star wars godfather and plenty of others so its no big deal its a curse thats what it is the two towers was perfect compared to rotk oh my god how boring this movie is pj could easily have edited and cut out 1 hour of footage which is completely irrelevant only makes you yawn oh well send lots of hate mail to me now i dont wish to offend any one but to protect the integrity of the rating system honestly if you enjoyed the film it was more because you read the books and have been avid about the story for a few decades than it was its cinematic quality im sure it was wonderful for what it was but people was it really the second best movie ever released saying that the return of the king was of better quality than network dr strange love or any of the greats is naive its story is not its so if you voted so highly for its story than you were voting for the book visually impressive but think about the pictures budget so what was it than it was unoriginal and certainly not worthy of second best film on imdbi sat through this movie yesterday the special effects and the visuals were great as in the previous two parts they are pretty much what you would expect after reading the books which i did a long time ago ok so everything looks nice but otherwise the movies had little to offer i do not want to bash the movies too much because they made such a good effort in illustrating the books so this will be brief some of the problems were that the characters are very thin the dialogue is terrible and the music mediocre at best the movies also have this tendency of just marching through the obligatory plot events at a rapid pace therefore while sitting through the movies i noticed i really did not care what happens to these creatures we are for example supposed to like the good guys because they are so beautiful handsome as opposed to the ugly bad guys and because we are told they are great but there is hardly any screen time for them to demonstrate any of these good characteristics as persons except for their nice manners compared with those of the bad guys i guess a 300 hour tv series might have been a much better format to fully present the material as long as they would fix the dialogue and the music but that would have been impossible yeah great looking but really boring boring and boring movie giving such a great ratings for this masterpiece is eating the top movie list since this really isnt great movie just nice arts etc but nothing more the first two were even better than this one this is all just about how great effects they can make for movie but well maybe people like this kind of movies nowadays i want more in movies not just good looking movies but good movies have to say im generally disappointed movies nowadays most of movies are just about how they look not about writing characters etc good that some does like this movie but i really dont last 30 40minutes i were just eating popcorn and thinking about my next days program 4 10 i know all the fans of the books loved the lotr movies but i never could stomach the books never got more than 125 pages into the first one even though i tired a dozen times the books were tremendously dull and uninspired the movies were very true to this vision think about it for a few minutes what exactly happened over the course of about 10 hours of film a few creatures went for a walk with some computer animated battles along the way big whoop dull bored me to sleep if i could write ten lines about how dull this movie series was i might inspire you readers to the same amount of dis interest that these movies make arise in me i was enthralled by a lot of the scenery shots but the dull color palette used in most of the scenes was just as unappealing as the dull plot im not going to bother comparing this to another series of movies because i cant think of another instance of such patently dull movies being so universally heralded i wish some really good books would be afforded the lavish treatment these dry tomes got a great film sorely let down by the ending i know jackson is only trying to stick to tolkiens version but the ending was unsuited for a film it just dragged on and on and on it really soured my experience of what otherwise was a great trilogy the interminable ending should have been resigned to a directors cut dvd version to satisfy tolkien fans the worst ending ever ai of course the lord of the rings return of the king is certainly this centurys masterpiece it has everything that a person could want in a film it has an amazing story impressive special effects top quality acting and some of the best cinematography of the past years it will scare you it will make you cry it will make you laugh and jump with joy and gasp at the immense scale of the epic tale this is the film that over ran films such as star wars and citizen kane as everyone in the world should be made to watch it it is a film that will be around for hundreds of years and will continue to amaze people even then a truly amazing filmit sucked big time spoiler at least one of the midgets should have died nothing worthy of a message in thinking that luck will get you to your goals and other people will have to pay for your incompetence the movie is excruciating and super long most overrated franchise of all time why does any character has to cry that much on a non drama flick i miss rudy playing semi tough roles i cant believe the so called weighted average allows all the fat misfits to place every geeky franchise of films inside the top 250 its pretty frustrating and disappointing any movie that has any association with comic con should automatically receive 2 or 3 full points decrease out of the score i think thats it dont watch this movie or anything from the franchise and specifically get away of the lord of the rings prequels that are even slower with half the battles and boring this was the dullest film of the 65 films i have seen all year it took an age to get going after 90 minutes many people in the theater simply got up and walked out the rest were asleep i personally demanded and got my money back if people develop dvt through sitting through this then peter jackson should watch out what happened in the gollum effects department between two towers and this entry for the first few minutes that he appeared he looked like he was made of clay or silly putty dreadful effects i also find the actors in these lord of the rings movies to be totally unengaging and uncharismatic in the end i was willing frodo to die because i got fed up of his constant whining peter jackson made a big mistake dropping christopher lee from these films as he was the only one to bring any level of class to them and was sorely missed lord of the rings will never be remembered as fondly as the original star wars trilogy simply because it is unremarkable and unmemorablehow anyone can rate any one of these movies very high is perplexing this is like fodder for the middle american masses lengthy boring scenes of mediocre effects and dumb costumes the monkey suit takes the cake and sums up the whole mess terrible acting wow they found someone who is actually worse than harrison ford lucas using joesph cambell to lend credibility to this crap was a sin i wonder how much money was spent on joe to get him on the sw wagon ok so it is a harmless movie and some people apparently like it but come on better than american beauty or being john malkevich or spirits of the dead or any monty python movie etc etc etc oh well enjoy it  it will put you asleep because of how slow it moves now its not that i don not like 3 hours+ long movies i mean my favorite movie is once upon a time in america its just that lord of the ring the return of the king breaks the record for slowest moving movie half of the movie is just frodo and his friend sam trying to find some type of volcano to throw the ring and destroy it before gollum can get a hand on it the other half is just this big huge battle being fought now you expect a battle to give be action packed and give you an adrenaline rush but this movie does the complete opposite because of how slow it moves and how lame the few battles that are fought end it is a complete waist of time and you should only watch this movie if you have trouble sleeping at night because it will put you to sleep after the first few scenes i am still ashamed of the academy for giving this movie 11 oscars and i am still wondering how it did not win any razzie awards  first the good things this people who made this movie really tried and put effort into what they were doing they get an a for effort maybe they tried too hard the good things about this movie come from the book the story the inspiration every good line every good scene what the movie brings to this story is not good it manages to make each chapter into a long drawn out mess its tiring to watch a super close up of some heroic figure speak a overly dramatic line delivered in some pseudo shakespearean delivery again and again watching elijah wood furrow his eyebrows for 2 hours almost drove me insane aragorn and his accent were to avoid exaggeration pretty annoying thanks to liv tyler for some super uninteresting words whatever they were something about love and forever yada yada yada that being said boromir and a few others had some memorable lines what passes for action is hyperbolic cgi silly costumes i loved seeing goblins prance around like broadway dancers and kung fu blockbuster style action scenes if you have scene any movie with swords and or fighting in it then youve seen this before if you like mtv video games or crack you will like this movie it is a triumph of using good books as an ingredient in the big movie formula you can rent this and spiderman 2 all in the same day then go download some britney spears pictures all entertaining for about 5 minutes if you are over 16 or you are looking for something interesting or new pass this by peter jackson has successfully completed his evisceration of the lord of the rings by removing the heart of tolkiens the return of the king leaving it void of humanity or pathos jackson continues his confusing and odd choices in this film revealing no confidence in the source material relying instead on more comfortable hollywood clichÜ©s and tired camera setups which are augemented by the playstation effects that younger audience members have come to expect and which leave others hungry for the versimilitude of tolkiens mamoth and respected at least by some work to paraphrase a touchstone phrase from the 60s `frodos dead and peter jackson killed himthis movie sucks really hard how it beat lost in translation i will never know 11 oscars really even best song huh is that right acting good nah sean austin deserved the best supporting really cant be no oh good people are blinded by its bland cg effect ok gollum looked great but the battle scenes weak take off the blindfold and realize that it is not good i am sad that this movie is second highest grossing of all time yeah i know what your thinking i saw it and i saw the other two the fellowship of the ring was good but the this and the two towers stunk really bad naughty peter jackson naughty go sit in the corner first and for most the movie was far too long there was no reason for it to be 3 hours and 21 mins much of the film could have been edited and it would have still had the same effectas for all the people who felt the length was good or wish it had been longer buy the dvd and watch the deleted scenses second to much of the film was way to unrealistic even in a place like middle earth im not going to go into any detail on this because some people may not have seen the film but take note also many of the things which could have made this an exciting film were cut short such as the dealings with the witch king besides some great special effects and nice cinematography the film was a huge disappointment in conclusion i am left with a few question how did so many people trick themselves into liking this moive and how did it get to number 3 on the users choice poll  one reviewer wrote [my father] spent wwii fighting in the pacific john tolkien had spent wwii warm and cozy in oxford writing drivel um excuse me but you do know that tolkien fought in the first world war indeed it was around that time that he started writing his mythology right i guess not otherwise you wouldnt have written such a silly uninformed comment as for the book being sexist and racist thats purely a matter of interpretation certainly not shared by all the whole complaint about there being no people of color in the lord of the rings is anyway a weak one tolkien created lord of the rings as part of a greater mythology which he intended to be his vision of english myth since nothing substantial was in existence in that regard england is indigenously white as far as i am aware thus all the characters in the silmarillion and lotr are white let me put my point in the form of a question are there white people in african asian or south american myths no there are not thus its unfair to criticize the fact of an all white cast in tolkiens mythology yes i am aware of the easterlings in the book who are described as swarthy and of the fact that they are in league with the dark lord but swarthy does not necessarily mean black and their being both swarthy and bad has more to do with the fact of their geographical occurrence and the fact that they are men it wasnt only the swarthy people who were in cahoots with the dark lord so many high expectations which are all brought plummeting downward in the final episode of the saga first of all orlando bloom is gay he is one of the most pathetic actors i have ever watched secondly this movie is incredibly long and drawn out with nothing any more interesting then what is in the two towers finally it is very disappointing watching the poor acting coming from elijah wood and sean astin they have done better in movie such as north and encino man fortunately for the avid moviegoers there are some quality fantasy scifi movies that you can go see such as manos hands of fate and mortal kombat annihalation the only good thing about this movie iswait there are no good parts about this movie take this review serious because i am serious if you want to call me and talk to me about it call 1 805 423 6182 ask for chris or alexi feel like im on another planet when i hear people talk about this movie it is probably the worst movie that i have ever seen its only rivals are the two previous lor movies was there some weird subliminal suggestion that im immune to were they serving some drugged cool aid that i missed the lord of the rings the return of the king the review how is it that such worthless eyecandy with one traited characters and a predictable storyline make it into the top 250 has every female under 18 given it a ten its disgusting the dialogue is pure crap much of every question asked in the whole series is usually answered by listen to your heart  is frodo alive  listen to your heart  should i marry aragorn even though hes mortal  listen to your heart the movies special effects are good though the battle scenes leave no suspense and are only fun to watch i truely didnt care for any of the characters aragorn as a brave noble warrior blah gimli as the comic relief wtf legolas as the cute archer yuck gandalf as the wise wizard dear god saramon as the greedy evil wizard pfft frodo as the innocent caring victim originality people etc who cares what bugs me the most is that this overrated garbage is actually in the top ten of the top 250 in front of pulp fiction citizen kane casablanca seven samaraui forgive my spelling 2001 a space oddesseythe list goes on its sickening summary the lotr the return of the king is overrated nothing more then eyecandy overall grade 1 10 40  well the lord of the rings trilogy seems to be a cheap action movie which hasnt much common with the great book from tolkin the return of the king has some nice battle scenes but its just another action movie with mostly good special effects many good parts of the original book where totally twisted mixed or deleted with not much sense and some very stupid parts are just invented from peter jackson to show more of this not so impressive orlando blum its good that tolkin cant see this movie i just hope it makes him not spinning in his grave my hint to peter jackson stay at your roots and make more splatter movies like braindead  i cant talk about the thousands or more positive aspects of this film when so many people are so overly optimistic about it and completely blind to its sometimes unacceptable flaws when i saw it i wanted to spit at the moviescreen its a truly great movie but there are so many stupid unnecessary faults and flaws preventing it from being perfect that you just gotta hate it doesnt people see the excessive use of cgi graphics making this film look like final fantasy dont you see that what you just think it looks cool wow look what they can do those special effects guys dont you realize no one will be impressed by the effex of this movie in 20 years those of you who havent read the books how can you like this at all as just a movie cuz it isnt even a movie its a really detailed animated synopsis of the books the three of them that is and not really accurate at that ever wondered where the drama went the depths of any scene or character the direction and exhibition if i can use that word of the parallel story lines or are you just revelling in the roller coaster ride feel to the film the cool effects weaponry and armour digital creatures the battle scenes and the heroic speeches with the typical romantic gaze of the eyes looking out over the horizon i actually usually enjoy the latter things but its just too much here and not good enough this really is true porn for the mid teenage rpg junkie and immature and nerdy men are you really that superficial cant you smell the melted plastic sure this truly is a gourmÜ© dish all the more reason not to have any funny odeurs interfering with it this review wont be helpful to most of you of course cuz yall are probably like everybody else i just needed to spread my word get it off my chest peter jackson deserves all the respect he can get and the actors are really great and perfect for their roles but dont over do it this trilogy film is not the best movie ever made not a chance princess mononoke and spirited away each carry more depth than all three parts of lotr together its magnificent and overwhelming but not brilliant a film of this magnitude shoulnt leave anyone unsatisfied but it did at least with me cuz it didnt live up to its potential and it wasnt even better the the prior part so of course i was mad at it how couldnt i be how couldnt you be its like youre fanatical muslims or christians and this is the holy bible or coran you cant even question it or criticize it wake up  spoilers this has to be one of the most boring movies in existencewith the exception of superman to me star wars has always been about the action scenes but theres barely any of them going on in this film the sappy romance subplot between han and leia falls flat on its face being too predictable the only good thing was vaders revelation that he was his father to luke and that wasnt even confirmed until the next filmi think i read something about that at one point it originally turned out vader was messing with lukes head all in all a weak film in the middle of the series bottom line the worst star wars movie yes i am including menace this isnt actually a review of this movie but a review of the top 100 movies list here obviously if the majority of users on imdb rate lord of the rings the return of the king as the 4th best movie ever there either arent many users over 14 or the majority of users know very little about good film making im sure i could easily come up with 100 movies that are better than all 3 lord of the rings movies thats really all i wanted to say is that by rating lotr as one of the best movies ever youre proving to the world how useless this site is for knowledgeable critical movie reviews how can one take the ratings on this site seriously after having realized that lotr is the #4 best movie ever according to imdb usersi love the lord of the rings all 3 included i love the epic extremely long nature 3 hrs+ each that really allows the viewer to become immersed in the world that being said as much as a movie like braveheart is extremely under rated for its amazing acting directing etc lord of the rings is conversely overrated exhibiting in many instances very poor acting gimli anyone a weak translation of the book the books blow the movie away and truly subpar directing regardless of what the academy or any one of you fools may think lotr could have been a truly epic masterpiece if directed and acted accordingly however it still remains a very entertaining movie even with all of its flaws albeit in ten years it may unfortunately only be remembered as the most overrated movie in history 45 all time are you kidding me that is absolutely rediculous which is really a shame for such an ambitious fun to watch moviebad bad bad it is such a shame that this movie is so bad it really has the potential to be great but no no no the first two movies were okay but this last one really sucked and yet everybody are joining this mass hysteria over this really really bad movie i just cant understand why a movie with really bad special effects and really bad acting bad directing but a great story can be the winner of 11 oscars the world has truly gone mad and to add it as the second best movie based on votes from users its sad just sad there are tons of movies that are better and this really is the movie that would never end very long ending 30 minutes of fading and ending only to not really end bearf i think people are mistaking the movie for the book sad i just got home and i must say that i am not as satisfied as i thought i would be the film is very good but in my opinion is far way to be considered the best of the trilogy both previous movies were more intense than this one the battle scenes are awesome but the rest is very slow and quite difficult to stand for three and a half hour the ending is boring and that scene where legolas beats a mummakill cmon what does an army stands for if a single elf can handle such beast a third part of a trilogy which is in the 3rd place  it is a great pity that people cannot distinguish between great works of literature and the failure to exemplify these works in the cinema graphic medium these three films adapted from the great work were shot on low quality film and in a manner to make the greatest profit from as much exploitation of its artisans as possible for example peter jackson knew that he could new zealand citizens to be extras at no costs due to the novelty of under taking such a project of this magnitude and glamor in a parochial isolated hometown new zealand countryside peter jackson fran walsh and philipa boynes bought the film rights of the great literature for a massive cost and then hired scriptwriters to prepare the screenplay adaptation in their names at great cost this was a very poor screenplay if you really loved the books and actually read them which most of the films audience probably never could or did how the motion picture academy members voted it best screenplay adaption and gave the award to these three people is rather suspicious the cinematography was very poor with many shots out of focus and overuse of various camera techniques this has been supported many cinematographers in many blogs the acting performances were very mediocre and the selection of actors was purposefully chosen from australians and new zealanders due to peter jacksons view that they are better actors than americans and the british in fact australians and new zealanders have this strange dislike americans despite consuming their films the animations of various creatures was so similar to the vampires in dusk till dawn it makes you wonder if the cgi people had much imagination the many gratuitously violent scenes not described as such in the books would have been very frightening to children let alone the ridiculous characterization of the golum in fact most of the cgi was carried out by americans hired by peter jacksons multi million dollar cgi suite which at the end of the day makes you wonder where mr peter jackson got the money to not only buy the film rights to the books but to build a multi million dollar film effects studio in new zealand the whole thing was obviously a massive profit making exercise in profit making with peter jackson and his mates securing huge merchandising deals in the planning of the projectit is further proof that the very wealthy and privileged can always demonstrate what their money can achieve not what they themselves can achieve due to any talent or real imagination it was not made for the sake of love of a great work of literature but for profit and self aggrandizement i fully understand that films must make profit but this one really couldnt go wrong with the material and the present day innovations in cgi i am certain that one day someone will remake it and do it properly and maybe some one like john boorman who was originally going to make the film i am so content in thought that there is a great difference between people like myself and the people who glorify this film and peter jackson  i really enjoyed this movie well about 45 minutes of it unless you are a die hard fanatic for the lotr books and maybe even then youll want to watch this with one finger on the fast forward button some scenes were excellent but not enough when diluted by so much filler the special effects may have been masterful but they didnt make it a great movie the movie simply takes itself far too seriously how else could the director possibly justify being almost 35 hours long similarly to voters here this is rated as #3 in the top 250 of all time that is so astoundingly overrated that i cannot understand it this with 65000+ votes it probably belongs in the top 1000 perhaps about #800 [how has the studio managed to create 45k+ imdb accounts to skew the voting] the basic flaw of the entire trilogy is that its based on a long winded violently racists set of books starting from that you end up with well you know truthfully this is a 7 10 but it could have been a 75 if theyd actually done some editing down to ~15 hourswat the hell is good about this movie its too streched out silly stupid ending every second you think its going to end but noooooooooo one more scene to gotoo long for nothing 3 hours can be smidged into an hour and a halfthe pervious 2 are much betterthat film is sososososos overrated its pathetic actually i was hoping for a grand finale since the first installment was a glorious epic tale and the second was a piece of rubbish i was thinking that this moive would at least save the triologys face all starts good with a nice version of the becoming of gollum but to my dissapointment once again the story is told with the use of too much action scenes and some bland conversations and a gruesome amount of corny one liners the feel of an epic dissappears the moment the first flashback comes and the undeniably bad actress liv taylor makes an appearance yuck adn whats the deal with eowen she was alright in the two towers but now she suddenly becomes this girl power icon im not a man she says and slays a nazgul so what you say well its not the fact that she isnt a man that kills the witchmaster but the fact that its a elven blade that strikes him and if i recall it correctly its merry who deals that strike if the movie only would of stayed true to the book why doesnt it this was a once in an eternity opportunity and that dork peter jackson blew it as a movie fan im appaled and as a tolkien fan im angry rape to say that this movie is overblown pap is an understatement like its predecessors this flick employs just about every movie clichÜ© in cinema history like long long death scenes fake death scenes how many times did freddo die only to our surprise hes really not dead at all  a mans gotta do what a mans gotta do scenes in fact what with the clip clop galloping of horses everywhere i thought it had strayed into a western ride like the wind type comments abound the mad bad king who dies a horrible death coz hes so mad and bad the cute little hobbits were all supposed to cheer for and even a darth vader type chief villaincoupled with a script that was so lame the better actors were really pushing themselves to the limit trying to make the lines sound at least half original in fact the only interesting characters in this enermous exercise in money grabbing movie cynicism were the villains the orcs at least had character not surprising then that the movie relies upon the gollum to sell it in years to come this lumbering saga of over hyped over produced trash will be not be regarded in the same way star wars is but in the same way titanic is bit of an embarrassment  i had such high hopes when i first heard that a tolkien fan was going to write and direct a live action+cgi version of lord of the rings only to have them cruelly dashed fotr was a bit rough but i said to myself itll only get better boy was i wrong i suppose the main problem is twofold first jackson is way too young inexperienced to have taken on this project he certain has ability but he has a lot to learn about filmmaking before even thinking about tackling such an ambitious project second for alleged lovers of the source material jackson and company took way too many liberties with the story changing them in pointless and even foolish ways perhaps this was inexperience maybe it was just laziness or a lack of understanding of the source material goodness knows that lotr is far from perfect as an example of storytelling but there is a great tale buried in tolkiens massive tome too bad that jackson and his crew were absolutely unable to bring it to the screen by the trotk jacksons exhaustion is practically oozing from the screen and hes lost sight of many key elements of the story  the star wars movies were the worst movies of all time science fiction by itself is bad enough let alone being a cult like nerd flick the music was the best thing and even that was melodramatic at times and come on whats the whole long time ago thing if we dont have flying machines now we most certainly didnt have them in the past ok so maybe the star wars movies dont belong on the bottom 100 but in the top ten is ridiculous what a protagonist i say as the great mavoric murdock said only the best will be the worst the irony in this comment is astounding for you see if the public does not recount the degeneracy who will let me explain for every brilliant movie made there are many more hidieous movies so then if there are an abundance of awful movies then mediocre ones will seem fantastic and good ones will seem godly for example the godfather my point is that the praise of star wars is merely a product of being surrounded by worse movies how long was this awful film almost 4 hours the last 30 minutes were really taking the mickey in no uncertain terms the ring gets destroyed thats it movie over we really dont need to see sam & frodo get saved by eagles or them return to hobbiton or see bilbo & frodo leave with the elves does that even happen in the book the end of the film drags on far too long also the build up to the 2 main big battles drags on far too long as well if you are going to adapt a very long novel learn from frank herberts dune which originally was 8 hours long when dino delaurentis shot it dont bother all of the lord of the rings movie are overrated but thats just my opinion they are not good enough to even be on the top 250 how could this be number 3 or did u just say hmm this movie won an academy award umm it must be good its not all it was was action and boringness now i dont necessarily hate these movies but definantly overrated i mean not even being worthy of an academy award or being on the top 250 i mean come on people ive seen people with good movie taste say these were good in my opinion the 2nd one was the best and the others were hardly okay for me and i did not like the 3rd and was very angry wen i saw it under godfather and the shawshank redemption i mean jeez now this is only my opinion but i know several people who agree with me now this is just my opinion so dont get all offended the third lord of the rings movie was absolutely painful to watch even worse than the second one it had me cringing and groaning all the way through and not because of any empathy for the characters but simply because the acting the scripting and the everything was so so so so stupid and that is quite the word i was looking for beauty and the beast arwen makes me so mad for appearing at all the wrong times and far too frequently its all very well to say directors privilege to change parts of the novel and all right im fine with that privilege but it can be taken too far arwen only appears twice throughout the books and her character is only established in the appendix j r r tolkien is most likely turning in his grave or at least frowning furiously from afar as he watches these mutilations of his wonderful trilogy and when denethor jumped off the pyre i almost died laughing and i dont think that was the reaction peter jackson was aiming for ah well disappointment comes in all shapes and sizes and the biggest disappointment of my life came in the form of a movie called the return of the king as god as my witness as god as my witness theyre not going to lick me im going to live through this and when its all over ill never be hungry again nor any of my folk if i have to lie steal cheat or kill as god as my witness ill never be hungry again this is what i was fully expecting to come pouring from sams mouth as he and frodo were collapsing for what seemed like the 200th time on the way to get rid of the ring or was that the heart of the ocean from some of the music and the similarity in the scenes between throwing the ring into the fire and heart of the ocean into the sea i wasnt sure i didnt know if i was watching gone with the wind titanic or some hobbit movie and if they had cut about an hour of elijah woods pained and soulful looks into the distance and the eyes of his friends they could have made the movie a manageable length just a wee bit too much drama what a disappointment peter jackson who is talented at one thing and one thing only spectacle finishes his hugely successful trilogy im so glad this less than mediocre hack was given the job of writing and directing the film adaptations of the some of the best written fantasy literature ever the innacuracy of the story shoddy pacing inconsistent characterization via poorly written dialogue and hugely misunderstood character relationships and statuses are the largest sins committed in this film but the problem goes deeper this is just another in a long line of films quite nicely summed up by the word blockbuster and quite nicely critiqued by the trio may it rip documentary the blockbuster imperative in which the course of popular culture is outlined as a quest for and to quench the thirst for excitement rather than enrichment thank you peter jackson for shitting on the world you are so over rated it hurts me and your movies will never stand the test of time stupid movie already slightly better than the first 2 installations at least we did not sleep for more than an hour during the show and caught the ending whats the fuss about these movies spectacular views well why not take a tour in australia and experience the views first handrotk is one of the most hyped movies of all time i think that it is also the most personally disappointing movie i have ever watched i was so excited to see this film i was left with a bitter taste in my mouth the first blow came when instead of showing the white wizard sauromans demise we open the film with something from the hobbitgollums backstory this made me mad because i was told that sauroman was cut because they didnt want to dwell on two towers apparently they didnt mind dwelling on the hobbit so what you have in return of the king is a villianous army with no general no main villian save for sauron who is only in the film as a spirit only what you have as the main villian is a bunch of stunt guys in very good costumes the action is fine in the film but aragorn just doesnt sell his part well imho his leaving to find the ghost army is waaaaaaay understated legolas and gimli are made into nothing more than his stooges who look assuringly at him whenever he has doubt frodo sam gollum on the other hand give great performances and are the only bright spot of the film although i think sheloub was a huge disappointment and did not live up to the hype preceding the film the ghost army looks like scooby doo animators drew it and the action scenes involving them are all wide sky shots where you cant see what is going on the multiple endings are also a plod along as the movie stops starts stops starts and finally comes to a end long after i was ready to leave the movie just overall disappointed me greatlyi saw rotk yesterday and its undoubtly the best lotr movie peter jackson is a genius and i really hope he wins an academy award for best director as always some goofs can be found but who cares the patient waiting is over because this great movie has finally been released and now some words about the actors elijah wood frodo played his part tremendously well but one cant really call him the star of this movie even though he carries the ring which he eventually destroys sean astin samwise played a much interesting character and i hope he gets nominated for his role merry and pippin played by dom monaghan and billy boyd are also two very funny characters they have a very strong friendship and dom & billy really show that on screen my guess is that it will be lotr time at the 76th academy awards in march 2004why ill tell you why this is my opinion first of all i cant believe its in top five of all times this is unbelievable and i think even the producer is surprised of the position of his movie im just asking you to think about what major revolutions the movie has brought first of all the story was already used in a previous moviethe lord of the rings 1978 the special effects are great but what about the matrix the music and the costumes are great but this is ordinary for a movie with that budget and the plot is for kidslets face it with no passion or feelings etc just the old war between good and evil witch is present in any jean claude van damme or stallone movie im very sad not because the world is insane about the movie because the movie is in top 5 of all times so they leaving me no chance but to vote the movie with 1 i watched the fellowship & could live with the changes the two towers made my heart sink too many alterations & additions yes additions i can understand cutting the story to fit but shovelling lumps of extraneous storyline in that is not in the book why extra elves at helms deep wtf why cut bits that those familiar with the books are expecting to add garbage that no one expects i cant explain the return of the king was for me the last straw the return of jacksons ego more like why they saw fit to change dialogue from the original in some cases only a few words & in others changing the speaker of the words this is peter jacksons lotr not tolkeins i havent checked but the credits should show inspired by jrr tolkein because this is not his work i will stick with the bbc 4 version which while abridged is true to tolkein & the pictures are better on radio i first saw this movie when i rented it out from my local video store i can honestly say it is the worst movie i have ever seen it doesnt even deserve the right to be called a movie i am a big fan of episodes 1 and 2 and i wasnt really disappointed with 3 but empire strikes back is just horrible the acting is dreadful the bad guys arent scary of funny and arent even both guys the kid who plays luke skywalker is dreadful and your left hoping the bad guys actually get him and strangle him the storyline is just stupid and why they decided to keep the same characters as the first two home alones is beyond me overall i have to say this movie is a big disappointment and i only gave it the rating 1 because i had to if i could give it a zero i would this is not a movie deserving of an academy award sweep i remember watching it on opening night and seeing the audience confused about when to leave fanboys with staffs and fake beards got up a good twenty minutes before the final roll and then quickly sat down realizing that hey it aint done well it should have been i think that if you win an award for something it needs to be great at whichever aspect throughout the movie won for editing but it wasnt edited well throughout the direction wasnt anything to hoist high either i didnt find the acting dynamic in any way and if i see one more helicopter sweep of the mountains as our heroes run oh never mind oh and the giant arachnid was nice but some of the other special effects ugh nonetheless the series was impressive because the time it was turned around in but i dont think they needed to sacrifice quality for getting em out three christmas in a row some of the special effects in the final lava sequence looked like land of the lost for chrissakes so for those of you who want to argue that they deserved awards because of the daunting task of turning around such films forget it they could have taken their time like harry potter and done fine i dont even like harry potter but i dont see flaws i dont see repetition the acting is more impressive so why award them when they didnt even live up to their best potential i look forward to the fan boys saying my comments werent helpful thats why i gave it one star if fan boys are going to bully the vote to put these movies in the upper echelon of films which is ridiculous i reserve the right to underscore them to help future generations know that the fans are delusional and overzealousspoilers frankly put this movie sucked what could have been spectacular with only a little care was ruined oh dont get me wrong if you are some lazy movie goer who considers yourself an expert because you own the extended editions of the first two movies on dvd you will certainly enjoy this movie if you are like me a hardcore fan who has practically memorized the books i dont see how you can enjoy this film it starts out fairly well and continues like that for most of the film although the changes are not usually welcome at all cite arwens magnified part to make it sappy or gollum and frodo leaving sam altogetheri could have accepted that sure shelobs lair was all wrong well yeah it did annoy me that at some parts aragorn was more important than the whole ring of power which must be destroyed the whole love triangle was blown way out of proportion and by editing out his almost death it might have been possible to film some of the wonderful scenes in the book that the movies carelessly deleted but like i said it was all right until the end the ring was destroyed magnificently i admit the aftermath was done well but there is no excuse for skipping straight to the happy ending lalala sunflowers and daisy chains and frolicking puppies for all what the just happened no scouring of the shire for that saruman just might have been left out altogether no adjustment for frodo i might also add that by having gollum and sam make so much external conflict for him it practically obliterates all the internal conflict the audience is unprepared and confused when he decides to keep the ring however back to the mangled ending put aside the major parts in an effort to appeal to teenage girls i assume the filmmakers decided to give arwen a much larger role and make eowyns affection for aragorn much more serious as well so why do they not bother showing her courtship with faramir a large part of the books is condensed into two camera shots of them standing beside each other at the coronation of glorious king aragorn who seems to have washed his hair for the occasion i know he was on a trek in the wilderness no shampoo but how come he shaved more then but back to eowyn her sudden attachment to faramir makes her seem like she is nothing but a man chaser first she goes after aragorn future king and current war hero when he spurns her love she takes faramir steward and war hero as the next best option ridiculous just ridiculous to sum up do not see this movie do not waste your money this review is long i know but it could be so much longer if i wanted to mention everything wrong with the movies anyone who is a true fan will regard this as nothing but filth a pure waste of time the director was pretty jealous of the fact that a movie has to end otherwise this movie would never have had an end an interesting start the first movie of the trilogy fellowship of the ring but absolutely boring on the road to the end of it im disappointed with this movie as ive expected more of it the characters seemed wonderful at the beginning but the director made the worst of them shameful more shameful as this is the movie that won the oscar i cannot think of the motives the academy awarded the prize to this movie but the money that went into it its the second time in the history that i know of that the academy appreciates more the cost of a movie than the quality of it and of the actors play its interesting in this approach that no actor in this movie won the oscar why is that  this would go down as one of the worst movie of the year an overhyped tale i havent read the book but after seeing the movie i will steer clear of anything to do with the lord of the rings the convinently call able ghost army made it the most anti climatic ending after the 6 8 hrs spent building the tension over the 3 movies it is the same as the anti climatic fight at helms deep when gandalf appears to save the day what was the purpose of the elves there were so many holes in the plot the emphasis that sam wise was not gay was sickening meant wasting 5 mins in the end showing he marries a woman and has 3 kids to make it more suitable to the times frodo and sam wise should have just come out of the closet it is a shame that people have voted it to become in the top 3 movies at imdb its an okay film epic and all of course the fact that its an epic like gladiator or troy doesnt mean its good troy proved that fact and alexander continued to prove it with one star antics to be quite frank peter jackson is an overrated director much like the lord of the rings movies are overrated movies if you notice all three are located in the top fifteen films this one happens to be ranked higher than greatly superiour films such as seven samurai schindlers list and even casablanca this is not the case with camera angles that make you sick utilising the admittedly beautiful landscape of new zealand to help push across into our heads the true epic feeling of middle earth but wait where are the interesting characters every one of them you feel so bored with by the time the first film is up you seem to hope that theyd be dead by the second one but no they come along to the third one to kick some sauron ass heres my view of lord of the rings a whole load of walking lord of the rings fellowship of the ring points there walks lord of the rings the two towers points there walks trips up walks on lord of the rings return of the king points there walks throws ring into mountain walks away take those completely identical scenarios and pile them up with useless plot for three to four hours per movie depending on which one you watch and i myself wouldnt touch the extended versions you really get the idea that the academy awards truly are flawed why look forrest gump won best film of 1994 instead of the shawshank redemption or pulp fiction titanic won best film of 1997 instead of la confidential and why lookey here lotr rotk won best ing film of 2003 instead of mystic river perhaps next year well have the constant gardener as the best film of 2005 that may actually redeem the oscars failing reputation a reputation that had truly fallen when they took this half arsed effort of a movie and worshipped it as best film man fellowship was much better than this piece of junk a lot of the shots were horrible the cgi except for gollum sucked the dialogue was beyond cheesy the battles were anti climatic the way the war ended w the dead people was dumb the ending dragged on and on and on i checked my watch at least 15 times during this movie the battle scenes blah and if the fate of the world is in your hands and your supposedly out numbered why freakin joke while your fighting and putting notches on your belt thats just so freakin lame the attempts at comedy in this movie were laughable if you want to watch a movie w real battle scenes do yourself a favor and go see last samurai ive seen that movie 2 times and im going to have to see it again to get the bad taste out of my mouth that is rotkthis movie is overrated and frankly sucks as a film it has very few elements of a good film and was toooooo long anyone can make a good movie in about four hours the trick is to stay under three hours and still have a forceful impact the movie had too many fronts there were frodo sam gollum aragorn dead people mary rohirran and gandalf pippin the movie is good entertainment if youre willing to sit long enough lotr freaks have kept giving this movie a 10 making a mockery of the voting no thought is actually being given during voting and personally i think people should just give it a one just to counteract the false votingi dont know if you have seen the same movie ive seen but this movie was awful i really really liked the first movie an obvious 10 the second was a little bit worse yet still a 7 but this one was really bad i mean what is the reason for a happy happy happy happy end which is 30 minutes too long the characters are flat and no one cares if anyone of the main characters dies or notlike the king because you cant feel connected to them gollum should be dead two times before he is falling into the fire it is just boring after the second part if hords of orks are fighting against man and the worst thing was legolas after sliding down this elephant like animal and posing so bad animated and so silly unfortunately this movie was so disappointing like matrix 3 you people are so comic it makes me batty is it a good movieyes was it a brilliantly imagined and epic series of filmsyes was it one of the best 50 films of all timenot a chance in hell i dont care if you 15 year olds want to live in fantasy land the rest of your lives but spare us from this lotr are the best movies ever crap we dont need to hear it and it makes us laugh it was a great series to watch but when you come on here and disrespect the film greats of all time and have any of these lotr movies in the top 100 it disrespects the entire film industry if you want to play fantasy time then go on a disney board and post away but do us all a favor and leave the imdb for real movies i have now put myself through the sometimes enjoyable but mostly painful experience of watching these three movies i have to say i do think the 3rd one was the best but lets be honest it didnt have much competition one thing is for sure this film and the trilogy as a whole is easily the most overrated event in history many films should be above this effort in the top250 the problems the plot for starters not only did it not make any sense it was basically after 9 hours about destroying a ring and fighting a couple of battles all the meaningless subplots and political gesturing really didnt add to the film the characters werent fleshed out at all even after 9 hours could you really mention much about any of the many characters as a result most of the time i couldnt care less about who was doing what and why for a film to be a classic surely it must have some surprises or must be original in some way and perhaps more importantly stir the juices of our soul all we had were some very good special fx and some nice new zealand scenery the filming was very much join the dots stuff nothing novel or clever it the way it was shown to the viewer do we really need to here the word `precious again and again do we really need to see yet another slow motion close up of frodos face all of this made the film and films over long and lacking in any substancewell this movie is not for people who like subtlety not for people who like good dialogues not for people who like interesting characters it is for people who love action action and nothing much else for people who love pompous battles on big screens hollow words rhetorics of of the kind great dictators are so fond of big words like today mankind will not fail sure i can see why people like this movie they are just easily pleased they see a big battle scene and theyre happy they see orcs orcs and still more orcs and they think wow these orcs must be metaphors for all the bad bad people that are out there on this evil evil planet how deep what geniuses are tolkien and peter jackson they see a helicopter view of a battlefield great graphics of a fictional city a realistic monster spider and theyre happy they see good triumph over evil and they think thats the way it should be because well uhm because its different from real life i guess it gives them uhm hope it must be nice to not see that cheap emotions the flat characters some of the most stereotyped dialogues ever written in the history of film it must be great to be able to love this movie i think that star wars episode v the empire strikes back bis the worst movie i had ever watched although i have only watched it one time i really do not like this movie for several reasons first the movie does not have a proper ending it just stops when all the battles have finished and do not explain any other things after the battle instead it only shows a shot of the characters looking out the window this really disappoints me second about the love between princess leia and han solo i have never thought that leia and han solo are a couple until they suddenly kiss it makes me feel very surprised because the movie does not show any obvious relation between them third the movie does not tell story but showing a battle sequence instead it is very boring for audience to watch finally the battle of luke and darth vader did not bring out a mood of climax but instead it makes me think that it is ridiculous these are the reasons why i dont like this movie  holy smokes this has got to be one of the most pointless trilogies ive ever seen i do not even know how it scored this high there was nothing that made it stand out at all throughout the 9 excruciating hours of watching frodo turn into a mentally disoriented fool i cannot recount a single moment in time where i said wow thats interesting first off the plot is simply unenjoyable it has no twist no character building and for gods sake its about a possessive ring watching the characters go through pointless trials to burn a single ring is not something i can find appealing in fact i was ready to watch any of these uptight hobbits meet their end that is a huge problem in this series not one character was tragically killed in the midst of any orc battle ok there was that no name in the fellowship of the ring but the audience didnt give a damn as to what was going on with him what made me even more angry was that these fools looked almost invincible when legolas and gimli were slaying orcs left and right as easily as brushing snowflakes away i was ready to step out of the theater i can see why people liked this movie the action was indeed thrilling and had great deal of special effects thrown into it i remember legolas first arrow being launched smoothly into an orc what a marvelous scene then i looked and he was launching another arrow in a similar fashion then another one and another one sure it looked great but it was so repetitive i got bored every battle in this movie is almost exactly the same swords swinging arrows launching and people screaming i just cant see what was so special about it i also could not get through my head the final battle scene honestly an army of the undead destroying the orc forces gee that must have been a difficult victory it was so predictable and unfair i simply hated this movie for all of the action attempts and turning a really old trilogy into a movie i was considering giving this film two stars but then i remembered the conclusion frodo and sam were being saved by a bunch of hawks or something and everything seemed to be at peace not a bad ending then the story stretches into farewells and goodbyes good luck and god bless ok i can tolerate this now bilbo is going into a boat and heading off to god knows where when is this bloody movie going to end by the time i got out of the theater it was nearly half an hour after the part where the movie would have made an effective conclusion my behind sweating like an oxen from boredom i would definitely not recommend this movie to anyone unless you are amazed by a couple of special effects i dont know how this movie did so well i think one critic said it was a good movie and it spread like wildfire or maybe there was simply nothing else to do but worship elves whatever the reason i do not want to see this ever againi want to be as honest as possible in my review of this film i comment on this movie as i feel outraged that it has been given such a high rating on imdb first my credentials as a fair and impartial reviewer i am a native new zealander my mum new peter jackson well & i quite enjoyed his early films bad tastethe frighteners heavenly creatures & particularly brain dead some of the movie sets were just a few miles from my house and i had the opportunity to work as an extra on the trilogy and all were treated graciously additionally i was a huge fan of tolkiens book and had a sense of excitement and wonder that the lord of the rings was to be made into 3 films in my home country many of the bad reviews posted here compare the book to the movie and the movie will always come off worse and i must admit that when i saw the fellowship i was horrified at how bad and boring it was compared to the book but come two towers i came with an open mind and quite enjoyed the film judging it on its own merits and i had the same plan going into the return of the king additionally i must admit there were a few parts of the return of the king that i thoroughly enjoyed the lighting of the torches the juxtaposition of the brave warrior riding of to almost certain death to please and prove himself to his father while dad casually feasts on grapes supported by a beautiful song the scene where the kingdom bow down to salute the brave hobbits also the brothers acting was fine aannndd thats about it this movie was awful for me first and foremost because it did not draw me in to the story for only seconds at a time did i care for or could i make sense of the story and the acting i was simply bored and restless some of the reasons for this follow the length 3 hours + + peter have you heard about the innovations in film editing and what is with the multiple endings it was like one of those nightmares where you wake up but you are really still in the dream and cant seem to get out i believe a natural ending would have been with the salute to the hobbits frodo oh nodo frodo wore only one expression on his face for the entirety of two towers and the majority of fellowship and return you know that look of pained resignation of sore weariness all those head shots kind of got boring also i just did not buy him turning on his loyal companion sam taking the rascally creatures word over his additionally having struggled so long and hard being so pure of heart for the whole journey you just suddenly decide you want to keep the ring at the last moment cmon sam smithersthe part where frodo sends you away and you start to cry i wish i could erase the pained forced feeling of that scene from my memory warrior woman i cant remember whether it was in the book or not but the ease with which you dispatched an enemy far more powerful than you or just about anyone for that matter seemed a little unlikely it bet daniel sons victory over a vastly superior opponent in kk3 hands down hordes of the undead those ghostly figures aragon summoned um it wasnt too suspenseful for me seeing them do battle since they were invincible and could not be attacked back legolas a shame to see the kick arse archer from fellowship & towers reduced to a one very fake looking scene taking down the baddies on the elephant dwarf i like a dwarf to be ascetic and noble not comic relief aragon why did you change your voice tone and go all james l brooks on us when giving your coronation speech my friend suppressed a laugh karl urban there was an excellent scene in the trailer where you screamed and wailed at the sky below your father the kings body lying dead on the earth that scene really got my heart racing i cant believe it was absent in the movie the battles who was fighting who the editing was such that i couldnt see which characters to root for as the action flied by too quickly and clumsily golem we get that the ring has corrupted your soul and turned you into something horrible over the years we get that you will make a play for the ring before the film is out was the opening scene biography really necessary finally and by far most disgracefully please keep in mind that all three films were filmed at the same time using the same actors production crew and locations the first two movies got just a few oscar nods in minor categories such as sound effects editing how can return of the king be that much better than the other two that it sweeps up 13 or so oscars everything for which it was nominated shame on you academy my guess is that the money from new line cinema was not all spent on making and advertising the film itself bouycott the oscars this flick was about 15 hours too long there was more wasted time and film in this installment and none of it added anything to the production this film certainly did not deserve any of the awards that it received thankfully elijah wood only has about 25 minutes of screen time total for the entire film im so glad this trilogy is over i am also glad that i didnt go see this flick at the theater i would have felt even worse had i spent 9 bucks on a ticket for this extended play boredom fest even at 299 the dvd rental was too much at least i was able to make my own intermissions no film should be this long i cant recommend this flick for anything but an aid for when you cant get to sleep this was a three and a half hour passing of a gall stone shame on the academy for showering this tragic effort with so much gold bad bad bad it is such a shame that this movie is so bad it really has the potential to be great but no no no the first two movies were okay but this last one really sucked and yet everybody are joining this mass hysteria over this really really bad movie i just cant understand why a movie with really bad special effects and really bad acting bad directing but a great story can be the winner of 11 oscars the world has truly gone mad and to add it as the second best movie based on votes from users its sad just sad there are tons of movies that are better and this really is the movie that would never end very long ending 30 minutes of fading and ending only to not really end bearf i think people are mistaking the movie for the book sadthis movie is so damn boring one of if not the worst film ever made give me a real movie with real actors with a producer with real talent these movies made me want to throw up they were so horrible dont waste your 3 hours watching this movie its not worth it theres better ways to spend your time did anyone really believe that green thing that cant even talk it was like that stupid jar jar character they put on star wars now if you want to see a movie with action and adventure with better writing then go watch face off dont waste a minute of your time on this movie please who ever voted and made this movie #3 where it doesnt belong it should be along the lines of worst movie ever i rather watch from justin to kelly a billion times then waste my time watching a movie like thisokay this is a pretty good movie but i just find it hard to see it in the top five thus the low score although it certainly has a lot of great things about it there is a great deal wrong with it as well which i suppose must be expected from a film that is trying to condense 500 pages of literature into over three hours it must first be said that this clearly too long or at least there are points in the film were it does seem to lumber along it also seems that jacksons choice in which parts of the film were to remain in the final cut left out a great deal of interesting stories from the books and the ending is completely different to that of the book and unnecessary that said it is still an incredible achievement overall with excellent battle scenes and amazing effects surrounding an already lovable story but i still wish jackson had made more use of the characters its a great film to watch for sure much better then a lot of the stuff were seeing now but it still could have been a great deal betterwell as all of the tolkiens books are nothing more than some dumb fairy tales any movie based on tolkiens book is gonnawell jay and silent bob fans you know the quotei dont like but i tolerate fanatsy in gerenal but this is by far anyone who likes sitting and watching orcs and goblins speaking single minded lines about some trashcan worth ring for 2 hours are welcome any sane person keep out 0 10 perhaps i cant lay all the blame on peter jackson the story was dumb to begin with for those that dont know the idea of the ring originates from platos the republic the ring of gyges basically this ring gives gyges the power of invisibility which he exploits to take over some kingdom and yada yada not a very interesting story on its own but good within the context of the republic glaucon and plato were arguing over the tendency of man to do good over evil and vice versa lotr does not intertwine philosophical explorations with a clever plot instead it merely takes this stupid ring story out of its origin and assumes that is insightful blah this is why i rarely akin to fantasy its authors are prone to employing cheap fiction thanks for making america even dumber peter jackson never make another movie please i can not believe that this movie received all the awards that it did it was long slow moving predictable and the acting was terrible i cant believe that they cut out over an hours worth of video to get it down to this length i wish that gandalf would have just given frodo a giant eagle in the first movie so that he could just fly in and drop the ring in the volcano and save us the pain of watching this series i was also worried that there was going to be a love fest between frodo sam and the other hobbits also with all of the computer generated scenes why go all the way to new zealand to film it at least it is all over with now the expectations that were built up by the first film and the second allthough slowed down really plunged down into the lava of mnt doom with this one it really makes you nauseous thinking about everything that is wrong in this film im not talking about the extended version that one is a lot better but still far from perfect and how everything could have been where should i start its overly sentimental i mean really and i like that s usually im a sentimental guy but here its really out of proportion and out of timing oh its really sad when faramir rides to meet the orcs when he has no chance of winning while pippin is singing som silly song like hes castrated and then breaks out and cries just like that bu hu this is a mythological style heroic fantasy tale not titanic everybody are so overly emotional and i dont even wanna talk about sam and his constant speeches about bravery and not giving in with the hand on the chest looking out over the horizon with the orchestra at full volume the only thing missing is the american flag bellowing in slowmotion behind him and frodo and his constant twisting your head like a puppy and looking with big eyes and a oh i love you so much smile at sam every time he saves him or helps him to keep going ok im getting carried away i liked braveheart for example even though it has some major flaws and people think that one is overly sentimental but that one is at least down to earth sentimental rotk is up in the sky almost gone out to space like i thought id never say this but it seems they producers crew and actors really take the film too serious really its a saga not true its a 20th century made up mythology history about an imaginary land its not a record of the holocaust for christs sake i understand how they needed to cut some scenes to save up time but well first of all they didnt succeed enough with that the films are 2 3h long and still it feels youre rushing from one place to the next like youre on a middleearth 8hour safari or cinematic tourbus maybe they shouldve cut it even more so we could at least get the feel of being someplace and not just passing by but whats really unacceptable is when he wastes all that preciously gathered time on exploring uninteresting or unimportant scenes and scenes that dont even belong in the story completely made up scenes for no logical reason the ugly made up bull rhinoceros beasts pulling orc wagons whatta f is up with that i dont even know if george lucas would accept such a badly designed creature in the star wars universe the really awful orc liutenant chief guy whos by the way made up out of thin air who doesnt even look like an orc but more like the aliens from peter jacksons early lowbudget cult films mr jackson this is not the time and place to have cameos or draw funny parallells to your bad taste films thats really bad taste disrespectful to the tolkien fans the mÜémaks are really cool but really too big i mean theyre not dinosaurs beasts heyre just big elephants all the small details costumes and armour etc are really beautiful really more than you could ever ask for but the white dwarf miniature esthetics of minas tirith is really bad cause it gives a whole synthetic comic book computer game look to middleearth where are the beautiful classical and authentic designs of edoras and rivendell and no catapult can throw rocks as big as whole houses that too is just corny and childish like in computergames all this and the excessive use and naive belief in cgi technology turns the battle of pelenoor fields which should be the total culmination and action peak of the film into a foney uninteresting starwars warhammer40000 mess its nothing compared to the battle of helms deep and thats not right and this cgi trend seems to be a virus infecting everybody in the film business its really sad these films will be outdated in 10 years but maybe thats a good thing rotk isnt the worst of the three technically but with the expectations you have from the first two the books if you know whats gonna happen the demands should be pretty high and in my opinion too especially after the hint in 2towers that the trilogy was going downhill just like the matrix this is the film that disappoints the most rotk is the greatest and heaviest of the films the first two would completely crumble under its weight if it didnt hold but they could also rise with it if it really grew as strong as it couldve and that is what it should have anything else is unacceptable to me and this is also why i hate it cause it really doesnt live up to its potential it doesnt even outdo the 2towers and it doesnt live up to the old exited expectations you had from the first film i cant understand how a new zeelander who used to make underground films could turn this old british tale into shimmering hollywood cheese its too pretty too pompous and sentimental and all the computer graphics gives it lika a fake sugarcoated shine or crust its like food add too many ingredients and spices and theyll take out each other and the dishll just taste bland its just too much of everything and the whole film falls flat its still stunning but rather tasteless and the only profound experience you might get from it comes soely from the overwhelming magnitude of the whole thing i still wanna congratulate pjackson on successfully bringing this gigantic project home thank him even if hes made me more irritated than delighted cuz im still glad that im able to watch these films he didnt deserve all those oscars but he definitely deserved a few maybe not for directing but for best film for the production but this film should not be ranked as the best fantasy film of all time sebastiani decided to watch this trilogy with a completely open mind to see what the fuss was all about i was rather embarrassed by the fact that i had never seen any of these movies which were heralded as great cinematic classics instead of the masterpiece i was promised however i was left with a great mediocrity the characters were barely 2 dimensional the plot was riddled with holes and horribly rushed and the dialogue was cheesy episode v was perhaps the least painful to watch but still isnt close to being good i dont know if its a case of a movie aging very badly but i cant for the life of me understand the allure of it to each their own i guesshowever the real acting triumph of the film is elijah wood as frodo baggins he continues his descent into corruption with an incredible talent that many could not pull off woods performance is so critical to the film because it determines the rings power to corrupt which needless to say is absolute the first two films established jackson as an incredible visionary shooting vast landscapes from his native new zealand with return of the king jackson really gets a chance to show off with hands down the most beautiful visuals of the trilogy jackson makes return of the king a gorgeous feast for the eyes while never resorting to mcg level over the topless jackson stays very grounded in his characters not letting the effects tell the story but only assist the wonderful dialog and characters think of return as a mix of fellowship and two towers with enough action and character development worthy of ending a film event of this magnitude the bottom line fans of the films will not be disappointed hardcore tolkien lovers might be upset by plot changes and interpretations made by jackson and the other writers however it is unrealistic to expect a completely true adaptation of the novels being that film is an entirely different medium despite the alterations jackson consistently stays true to the major themes and ideas from the original text while adding some of the finest film making ever put to screen the lord of the rings the return of the king is one of the most finely tuned and cinematically perfect films ever made not only the best of the trilogy but a crowning achievement in epic film making moves even further from the source material more so than the two towers by peter jackson and fran walsh too many elements are changed from the heart of tolkiens work sam would never have been turned away and by the way just how did he find that sword and the light of elendil in shelobs lair with no light source also shelob is spider like but not a spider there were no webs in her lair even worse is the acting of john noble as denethor yes denethor has despaired but int he movie his madness is related to his use of a palantir and competing against sauron saurons will was stronger and he bent denethor left him bereft of hope this movie he is a caricature a cheap poorly rendered badly overacted caricature faramirs character was assassinated in the second movie but it is his father who is torn asunder even worse in this one aragorn had the sword anduril after he left elrond and rivendell and says so in the the two towers before entering the hall to meet with wormtongue and theodenbook here it is given to him by elrond who never came to visit aragorn it was elronds sons and the remaining rangerswho allude to no longer protecting the borders of the shire foreshadowing the scouring and they brought the banner of the king not the sword aragorn acts like a haughty king in the paths of the dead where in the book the scenario is much more dramatic and better also the dead were released before the battle at pellenor fields after helping them capture the ships with black sails that scene looked like the frighteners part 2 absolutely ridiculous it is a pretty to look at movie with no substance when compared to the source material tolkien loved the scouring of the shire and felt it was the true climax of the entire work yet peter jackson called it a simple denouement and said he hated it the better story isnt in these movies and i hope that people can read with a finer eye than they watch these movies with they arent that good and each slips further down the first adaptation was the best of the three and this was the worst hands down yesthis movie has great production valuesbut it is artificialfalsewithout a single remarkable performancei adore ian mckellen and cheese lines from the most commercial and stupid hollywoodthe humor between gimli and legolas is so simple and stupid that i had to laugh and the hobbits jumping in frodos bed at the end is one of the most ridiculous moments of my spectators life the battles are a poor imitation of lawrence of arabiapeteri prefer you in heavenly creaturesyour great masterpiecethis movie is only for fansnot for mei will say this movie is the worst of the five nominees to oscarsmystic river and lost in translation are great movies much much better than this piece of crap for male teenagersthe difference between art that comes out of the studio system and art that comes out of a lifetime if only we could develop a moving image pillar that was not driven by base profit we might see an expression of tolkien on film that was decent the fall this is the beginning of the end for our civilization when art is so corrupted that people can no longer even tell the difference our way of life is over anthropologist alien or otherwise will mark the success of these films and of george bush and of television as the harried and quickened end of the west not unlike the fall of numenornot that you would know anything about that from these adaptations what a disgrace how dare jackson call this tolkien  ok so i saw this movie on dvd last weekend and after those long 200 minutes i still cant understand all the hype and hoopla associated with it and being called the greatest trilogy of films of all time ill be the first guy to agree that the visual effects are amazing and they blew me away and directing a fantasy tale like this is a colossal task but i cant comprehend this movie getting 11 oscars probably because there werent too many strong candidates this year it deserved every award in the visual effects category but best editing cmon now im sure they could have done a lot better than 200 minutes after watching it for awhile the plots if i may call them seem to repeat themselves its just another new breed of evil guys creatures with new out of this world names and our heroes get past them imho mystic river was a better movie and deserved the best motion picture for the year i dont think the academy should give best picture award to a movie just for its visual effects dont get me wrong im really not trying to bash this movie but i really cant see why this is rated the #3 movie of all time on imdb with the other two parts in the top 10 the only reason i can think why this movie is rated so high and other exceptional movies are falling in the ratings is due to more people voting especially for the latest movies nowadays besides every other person has a computer these days and i wouldnt be too surprised if the younger audience preferred this visual grandeur to an intellectual movie which may be harder to grasp i personally like movies which make me use my brain for thinking and not just for watching like matrix mulholland drive sixth sense memento etc at the end of the day this is nothing but a huge fantasy tale movie which has a few human characters in the midst of grand visual effects i havent read the book but im sure the whole trilogy could have been concised to 4 5 hours instead of 9 10 hours i kinda feel that the film trilogy is over rated but thats just me ive noticed some people cant seem to accept that others dont like a particular film but after all likes and dislikes are just a matter of opinion watch the movie if you have a lot of time in hand and dont want to think too hard its an okay film epic and all of course the fact that its an epic like gladiator or troy doesnt mean its good troy proved that fact and alexander continued to prove it with one star antics to be quite frank peter jackson is an overrated director much like the lord of the rings movies are overrated movies if you notice all three are located in the top fifteen films this one happens to be ranked higher than greatly superiour films such as seven samurai schindlers list and even casablanca this is not the case with camera angles that make you sick utilising the admittedly beautiful landscape of new zealand to help push across into our heads the true epic feeling of middle earth but wait where are the interesting characters every one of them you feel so bored with by the time the first film is up you seem to hope that theyd be dead by the second one but no they come along to the third one to kick some sauron ass heres my view of lord of the rings a whole load of walking lord of the rings fellowship of the ring points there walks lord of the rings the two towers points there walks trips up walks on lord of the rings return of the king points there walks throws ring into mountain walks away take those completely identical scenarios and pile them up with useless plot for three to four hours per movie depending on which one you watch and i myself wouldnt touch the extended versions you really get the idea that the academy awards truly are flawed why look forrest gump won best film of 1994 instead of the shawshank redemption or pulp fiction titanic won best film of 1997 instead of la confidential and why lookey here lotr rotk won best ing film of 2003 instead of mystic river perhaps next year well have the constant gardener as the best film of 2005 that may actually redeem the oscars failing reputation a reputation that had truly fallen when they took this half arsed effort of a movie and worshipped it as best film i have seen many movies in my time a lot of bad movies and a lot of good movies i like movies from all genres this is easily one of the worst movies i have ever seen i cannot comprehend why this movie is considered good an overacted badly directed self important repetitive uninspired shallow video game of a movie not a single character of depth ok smigle slighty what was the point no imagination in the directing acting set and art design slow motion oy am i sick of slow motion now that was creative editing whats with the ending that was a 30 minute goodbye get on the boat already die already die die die die die how long does it take to die gandalf all powerful wizard nine hours of movie and all he can do is shine a light in the dragons eyes ooooh scary light not recommended for anyone and those who liked it are wrongwrongmore attention should have been paid to the eyes in the blue screen sequences in the film it is all too easy to see three distinct light bulbs reflected in the eyes if we are to believe the actors are on the mountain then they should not be lit as if they are in a studio at times i felt like i was watching a weather broadcast you know the ones where it is so blatantly obvious that that what is going on behind them is only a projection im sad to say that there is still a long way for cgi to go in terms of becoming believablethis movie is a painsimply horrible boring too long bad acting bad writingpratically i don t save nothing of this pile of garbagethe fake looking special effects are some of the worst i have ever seenthe sad thing is that this overrated turkey won so many oscar quite a testament of the low level of the academy awardsterriblethe editing is a complete mess the only saving grace are the wonderful new zealnd landscapeshow many ending it had 10 20 come on its simply laughablein conclusion a very bad and overrated movieanother thing this movie is number 3 of all the time imdb webmaster its time to change the imdb vote modalities if this movie did not have based on book by jrr tolkien it would have canned like waterworld and other big budget disasters having based on book by jrr tolkien does not guarantee success even if the scriptwriters followed the book word for word and yet peter jackson and fran walsh et al took it upon themselves to re write the lotr book and change the characters almost diametrically opposite to what they were written and it didnt work at all a director producer is entitled to modify the book to make it accessible on screen hardly one change from the script team worked at all in this case gandalf took the brunt of the bastardisation in rotk after aragorn got butchered in the ttt if not in fotr in fotr peter jackson was lucky in making a clone of the bakshi cartoon and it turned out fine with the new additions on the dvd once the cartoon ended in ttt however jackson just ran out of ideas and inspiration rotk is brash and loud and big and comedic production but the substance isnt there despite drawing from the book of the century some dialogue were puzzling go home sam was there a taxi available nearby others were just bad a diversion thanks legolas there was a lack of suspense and a total lack of sacrifice both sides seemed evenly matched camaraderie nobility the forced emotions and acting and soft lighting only go to reveal how clichÜ©d this anti hollywood movie really is is it then any wonder that christopher lee wanted off this badly conceived and edited project enjoy it as a fantasy film and an inside joke from the scripting team that no one really gets and nothing more despite 11 oscars thanks for the effort peter but please have the self respect to refuse sympathy oscars or if you really want to kill 3 hours with the kids people just want to believe so desperately that the tolkien movies are as good as the books when the hype will have died down the merits of these films will be judged accordingly the fact that chris tolkien son of the author remains silent on the trilogy speaks volumes on the quality of the trilogy as an extension of his fathers writingfirst i am a huge fan of the lotr series by tolkien it is one of the most richly detailed and wonderfully written stories of all time and it pains me to see the dreck that peter jackson has produced i didnt mind the fellowship of the ring i thought it was definitely the most concise and well directed of the three films also the visual aesthetics of the films are excellent the set design and choice of locale is impeccable and i applaud the people involved for their dedication to recreating the surreal wonderful world of tolkien on screen however it is the technical aspect of the project what should be the real beef of the film that puts the knife in the two towers marked the real beginning of jacksons self righteous altering of tolkiens noble story and left many fans and serious film goers wondering what went wrong but return of the king takes the cake for what could very possibly be the worst adaptation of a novel in film history jackson changes large portions of the plot of the novel for no apparent purpose even friends of mine who had not read the book asked me why certain scenes resolved the way they did the character development is excruciating as some of the major character based events from the book seem rushed and inconsequential in the context of the film jackson has done a great job at remembering the characters names and their titles but has drawn a blank on their behavior values emotions and relationships with other characters the script is pathetic tolkiens majestic storytelling and tasteful use of pathos and emotional turmoil is replaced by long winded sappy clichÜ© monologues complete with the exact same musical score used for the previous two films entire scenes are based around petty arguments and melodramatic emotional breakdowns and filler dialog is rampant it seems that jackson did this simply to keep the 3 hour running time the action sequences are grandiose and somewhat true in objective form to tolkiens telling of them but jackson employs cinematography that is on par with a nickelodeon miniseries using cheap close ups and nauseatingly swirling camera angles that leave the viewer feeling more confused than involved in the action jackson throws in some cheap action film comic relief during the battles giving the viewer the impression that the characters are not fighting for their lives but rather swashbuckling for swashbucklings sake very simply this is not the lord of the rings that i grew to love years ago when i read tolkiens masterpiece i am a supporter of artistic freedom in the adaptation process ie kubrick coppola but not when the adapter simply has no artistic ability in his craft jackson genius behind such film classics as the frighteners and dead alive this film does not belong in the top 250 nor do the other lotr films knowing that this film is above seven samurai and casablanca and that the first two lotr films are the reason citizen kane sits at #11 sickens methis two hour version is a terrible war movie very violent and i wouldnt want my kids to go through what we went through watching these six piles of garbage the empire strikes back 30 minute version that garry hixon put in his files after innerspace is really really a masterpiece unfortun ately disney would not allow it to actually be released i only get about 30 hits a day on my 4 videos and im sorry to say dont have the money to release too many more but theres always hope i really enjoyed the exp erience in 1980 but i was a dumb kid stoned on marijuana and acid the computer graphics were very avante garde at the time its definitely a love story compared to my version but is is very long and very boring there version of the force is levitation which is not the force the force is feeling it feeling it and not using the ability too often then levitation is possible thank you disney love cinderellai dont get the point with all that 11 oscars 9 10 on imdb but what this is sensed to be something artistic some postal card landscapes and ridiculous one liners damn try to be intelligent scenes about loyalty and all there is nothing in this movie nor in the two others that can let me say it is a good movie no plot no acting no directing there is nothing in this movie and i dont post that to provoke reactions i truly think it and i dont understand to be so isolated with this point of view there are well done heroic fantasy movies like conan the barbarian that are seen like average movies and this is put on a podium i hope im not the only one it makes wanna pukeif the first film bored you to tears and the second one bored you to death the third film will not affect you because you are now numb and totally disinterested we have even more of those pointless scenes with sam and frodo more battles and more cgi and how many endings can a film have theres a huge battle and then they tell you there is another one and its still not over because there are a million loose ends and then they go back home and then bilbo leaves home and then sam has children is that the end or is there more i cant even remember i fell asleep during one of the particularly tedious scenes with sam and frodo this is not a film its a pointless sequence of scenes and an exercise in cgi that resembles a video game one you can only watch but not play and i still dont care about a single bloody character in this film if you are a tolkien fan i guess this is as good as it gets for the rest of us its just another movie and a fairly peculiar one imagine star wars return of the jedi without an appearance by darth vader or the evil emperor thats what you get here a struggle between good and evil with the leaders of the evil hordes conspicuously absent its quite strange then theres the consistent theme that the better looking you are the better your character is dr king convinced me that it was the content of my character that counted not my appearance but in all three movies of this trilogy the two go together quite closely its an old hollywood theme but not particularly to be admired as for aragorn preferring arwen to eowen i suppose there is just no accounting for taste and im sure it is faithful to the author and what can one say about the seemingly endless multiple endings not very dramatic but perhaps more interesting than the usual single climactic ending so on the whole i find the return of the king a watchable film but hardly one of the greatest of all time eleven oscars i guess it must have been a bad year for movies now that you mention it theres been a lot of those in recent years this was a bad bad movie at one point i was going to ask for my money back because i thought that the reels were put in the projector in the wrong order save you money save you time the best thing that you can do is to do anything except watch this movie if i could rate lower that a 1 i wouldlord of the rings is an overlong piece of crap from one of the biggest hacks in hollywood peter jackson used to make low budget horror films that were amazing now he makes big hollywood movies with big hollywood stars his aim now isnt to make good movies his aim is now to make as much money as he can why cant hollywood start making films that are actually good instead of films that they make to reel in cash who needs so much money why does peter jackson need more money seriously peter jackson needs to stop making movies he ruined king kong recently and he made three films that are entirely too long based on a crappy overlong series get this film off the top 250 of all time it sucksand poor characterization as a technical achievement its a masterpiece as a work of drama its mediocre to lame the dialogue scenes were overwrought with drama much like a soap opera although instead of sappy hammond organ music we had the sappy orchestral score rising and falling on practically every syllable jackson deserves a lot of points for his technical skills but none for his artistrythe godfather was a sickening experience the first time i saw it in its initial release and it hasnt changed i thoroughly disliked the films spirit finding it very ugly at its heart i saw little justification for its existence was sorry i saw it and have tried to forget itone thing i will say about people one generation older then me you dont like violent movies if they are about zombies or guys in mask with knifes or chainsaws but when it is about guys with greasy hair with guns you cant get enough of it the men from my generation come by it honest about enjoying violent movie there is not one likeable crictor in this crap this is one of worst gangster movies ever the only gangster movies that are worst are sequels this movie is a pile of pooh it is not the best movie ever it is pooh pooh never never never see this movies it is pooh pooh pooh pooh pooh dont wast your time dont wast your money pooh they all bad guys kill each other boring i want good guys in crime drama poohi personally find this film to be a milepost on the decline of american society this is a film in which paid murderers are our heros who endear themselves to us with witty banter between their bloody exploits it features such entrancing scenes as countless murders s&m rape drug overdose and other fun things to watch its a wonder six flags hasnt opened a thrill ride to capture the whole experience it features all manner of completely unredemptive characters doing cruel inhuman or brutal things to each other is this entertainment the last straw for me was when a young man was accidentally shot dead by our irascible heroes the big problem posed by this is how will we clean out the car what can you say about someone who views human life so cheaply hit men or no what can you say about someone who finds such spectacle to be entertainment the characters here are completely dehumanized uncaring about the horrors they inflict on one another and ironically much of the audience must be equally dehumanized to accept these characters as the good guys if tarantino is the genius this film led people to believe that would have to be his point wouldnt it that to enjoy this movie you would have to be in some way sick theres nothing deep or important going on here so a critique of this film is almost unnecessary what passes for quality film making is nothing more than an overproduced loud stunning imax experiment in eye candy that masks once again a slowly moving thin story line obviously the members of sag have dispensed with background checks on film editors theres enough slow motion footage here to circumnavigate the globe twice many people will be amazed by the neverending in your face action sequences but for those who still pine to see the actors perform also youd better search elsewhere its like trying to read the latin version of war and peace while simultaneously being pulverized inside a blender and if having way too many computerized fight scenes forced down your throat wasnt enough just wait the full ninety hours for the saccharine glazed overlit endings and there are at least 5 of them for a while i was expectin obi wan kenobis ghost to show up and smile goodbye and cate blanchett never looked so vapid its brass tacky loud long obvious schlock and thus hugely popular beautiful looking rarely translates to quality in content and this is a prime example giving so many awards to this fillibuster is just a waste of gold plating i just managed to stay awake through this load of crappy excuse for a motion picture it only contains a enormous amount of words that donäÇt say anything the two main characters are so stupid that they should never have been created and when bruce willis disappears from the movie it is so totally dead this is a total waste of time and so is commenting on this junk so i will stop nowlong and boring and not worth writing two sentences but since i have to long and boring and not worth writing two sentences long and boring and not worth writing two sentences long and boring and not worth writing two sentences i think you get my point wow a lot of people have been fooled into believing that this was a great film ive never seen anything like it and i hope i never will again this is one slop of a film and im disgusted to know that it has so many high reviews it was a confusing ball of goo that amounted to nothing i didnt care for the characters and never will what a hopeless bunch of freaks i dont jump on the freak bandwagon unless theyre natural ones not arrogant embodiments of deranged entertainment the glorification of smut is worse than the smut and that is exactly what this movie is the sad thing is i dont believe that some of these actors were acting at all they were just being themselves travolta and jackson in wigs that was scary the only interesting thing about the movie was the sequence of events i like the way that it started at one point and ended in the same but dislike everything in between the problem with this film is that it tricks the audience into giving it great reviews it uses the peer pressure method you know this movie is for intelligent and cool people crap well ill gladly stand among those who know that this was nothing more than a shock flick it was produced to see if the letter could be pushed a little further unfortunately it drags what little respect that hollywood has with it im afraid that this is one of the major stepping stones to a pathetic industry that only produces films for vulgar lust theres my two pennies dont spend them all in one place man fellowship was much better than this piece of junk a lot of the shots were horrible the cgi except for gollum sucked the dialogue was beyond cheesy the battles were anti climatic the way the war ended w the dead people was dumb the ending dragged on and on and on i checked my watch at least 15 times during this movie the battle scenes blah and if the fate of the world is in your hands and your supposedly out numbered why freakin joke while your fighting and putting notches on your belt thats just so freakin lame the attempts at comedy in this movie were laughable if you want to watch a movie w real battle scenes do yourself a favor and go see last samurai ive seen that movie 2 times and im going to have to see it again to get the bad taste out of my mouth that is rotki dont like this movie because it is boring and stupidnot entertaining and nothing interestingi dont know why it is even in top 250peopleplease vote 1 for thislook at movie to see how bad it isand you

therepleasepeoplevote 1 for this garbagei dont want to look this even in top 250dont destroy world of filmpeopleboring and stupid film is not for top 250especially not for number 1i feel sorry for epiclegendary masterpieces that are underthisi hate this film with all my hart and soul 1 out of 10 cheers the 90s sucked it was one of the major eras of entitlement and dagnummit quentin tarantino was entitled to the stylistic gimmicks he absorbed from french new wave 70s exploitation and martial arts films he was entitled to use every character as a mouthpiece for his preciously quirky offbeat voice he was entitled to that word that makes spike lee mad when white people use it he was entitled to co opt obnoxious heroin chic hip retro fauxhemian fashion trends tarantinos movies echo the problem with modernism okay you think the status quo is bad but if what you do is just a kneejerk reaction to that status quo with no values ethos or any sort of moral core how can you be sure the result wont also be bad in fact chances are it will probably be worse right nonsense the emperor doesnt appear to have clothes but thats just because only the most profound virtuous people can see them you want to be part of that group right  next to burt lancasters the swimmer this is the worst movie ive ever seen if you like two hours of non stop profanity senseless violence and a story that has no beginning no middle and certainly no conclusion and if you like an underlying theme of inhumanity and perversion then i recommend it it you want a story that is well acted and well thought out dont waste your time this is a movie geared for an audience that is very young if only in mentality and very unexperienced in lifethis film stands out like no other as an utter piece of shte when i see all the accolades and devotion that film receives it makes me want to vomit not only all the bile in my body but the blood that is contained in it as well pulp fiction is a testament to our downward spiraling american society it is a monument to the shallowness the arrogance and vapidness of our self obsessed culture that dwells in the american consumer mind only in america a talentless director whose only ability is to plagiarize greater works can become the most celebrated creator to ever enter film making but you cant say a word because his following is ravenously sycophant they know ever word every phrase every bit of dialogue but they certainly dont know the difference between the real deal and a cheap imposter sam pekinpah never sat down watched a slew of movies and said im gonna steal this scene or that dialogue from this movie and directly put it in my movie nope he created his own stuff he may have sat down and wanted the same feelings to be interpreted in his films but never exactly the same way neither did sergio leone john carpenter george romero ringo lam bo arne vibenius simon nuchtern the shaw brothers joseph sargent akira kurosawa franÜ_ois truffaut or even robert aldrich even george lucas after the atrocities that he has committed to his own films in later years has done this most of the names that mentioned are probably unmemorable or unrecognizable to most people but they are in fact only a few in a very long list of directors whose have been stolen by tarantino except of course george lucas so far anyway anyways that does not mean his movies do not have merit the earlier ones like pulp fiction are laded with quirky and funny dialogue but thats all they have because plot characterization and substance have gone out the door tarantino cant even tell you a linear story he uses a disjointed structure to hide the weak plot he uses clever dialog to take place of decent characterization in fact the funniest thing to me is that his seem to have a non stop spouting of words they never seem to stop talking but in the end they never really have anything to saythe movie starts off with some interesting dialog but it quickly falls apart and becomes unwatchable some people apparently found it clever to tell the movies stories out of chronological order in fact it undercut any feelings one could have for the characters and made the movie far more tedious then it had to be the first half is merely dull and boringthen it becomes ugly gross vicious and disgusting it ends up being forgettable and sickening out of the 50000 movies and 50000 television episodes i have seen in my life this would rank about #8 in the 10 worst needless to say i have never bothered to see a tarentino movie after this onei have seen a lot of movies made from computer programs lara croft etc however this computer generated cartoon beats them all no nobody really gave a great performance individually or they would have got a nomination and won it no doubt but the graphics oh man they almost looked like a real movie being shot moreover the special effects were incredible i can see why this movie won seven oscars for special effects alone i mean you have to give it to this movie it had some great special effects oh sure the acting was overdone and a bit sappy but man get a look at the special effects here i mean it won 11 oscars so i guess it must be the best film ever even though nobody from the film was acknowledged for their performance because nobody was really great in it but man the special effects here outstanding hey a billion geeks cant be wrongi will never ever understand the love affiar people have with this movie it is completely and utterly over rated marlon brando is not the god of an actor he and people make him out to be neither is al pachino for that matter the acting is pretty stiff and unbelieveable it was so freaking long ugh i hate this moviethe godfather all in all is a great movie and the best in the organised crime genre but putting it as the number one movie in the top 250 films of all time and the top of countless lists is too much the roles of marlon brando and al pacino are excllent but the film on a whole is very over rated the direction is good not excellent the script is by no means ground breaking but many people still refer to it as the best film ever made next time you watch this movie compare the script to something with more life and witeg fight club and more lavish directingwithout the use of computer graphics this film would not be worth the price of a cheap bargain day 3 for 1 special rental at the local video store true the locations and cinematography add to the film however heaven forbid that the cast should either have to act or in the case of the veteran actors overact cg removed and this thespian in name only grouping are woefully short of the depth and quality characterization brought forth in the classic book the direction is sporadic and the pace is inconsistent leaving little to the imagination why so much of the budget was spent on computer technicians instead of acting lessons sorry for all those who jumped on the lemming band wagon for this one but lift your heads above middle earth and return to the land of the living i think the hype around this movie makes people completely overrate it ok heath does a great job at the joker but the movie itself has many flaws 1 the balance between good and badguy is all out of sync batman fades into the background he also has way less dialog than the joker this makes the movie unbalanced i think they re cut the movie after heaths death to put him in the foreground 2 the movie is tooooo long this story can be shorter with less redundant scenes its like they couldnt choose what to put in so they just put all of it in this gave me and some of my friends several yawn moments near the end 3 gotham city looks like a normal city in batman begins it had a real comic feel but in this movie it doesnt which is a shame really 4 the point of the movie i wont tell u what it is but yes this action movie tries to make a philosophical point of course this can be great but in this movie it gets chewed over and over and over and then it gets forced down your throat 5 lack of humor an occasional sharp or funny dialog would have been great however the dialogs arnt very good and theyre never funny 6 the plot devices are really quite lame i wont go into details but most of the plot devices are silly and inspirationless even the comic manages to feel more realistic than that somehow the movie doesnt manage to convince the audience of its own logic probably cause there is none all in all its a fun movie with great performance by heath as the joker however it is not the masterpiece people try to turn it into it doesnt deserve a place in the top 250 and it is not the best movie of 2008 of course if you settle for mediocrity this is the movie for you  i think its adorable that certain members of an unspecified generation find the dark knight aka batman 2 to be a masterpiece of contemporary cinema is adorable the right word christian bale reprises his role as the humorless comic book hero and heath ledger joins the cast as the humorless comic book villain ironically named joker ledgers joker is about as much fun as an emergency spleenectomy which means to say he never laughs never makes anyone laugh and never jokes are we having fun yet the film takes place in the same gotham city from the previous film flat bleak black dark foreboding menacing pessimistic intense sinister colorless numb petrified is this the fun part bale an otherwise fascinating actor manages to create a black hole as both bruce wayne and batman leaving the audience without any protagonist for whom to cheer christopher nolans solemn direction is the same as in the first hes working so hard to convince us that all of this is absolutely real that there is no chance for any fun fun in a superhero movie i must be out of my mind whats sad is that poor heath ledger took the role of actual psychotic so seriously that it contributed to the mans death no film role is worth your life and if playing the villain in a comic book movie messes with your mind youre doing it wrong no offense to the late actor whose performance here would have been great in a dramatic or psychological film but jack nicholson nailed the joker in 89 it was nice of the academy to give ledger the posthumous oscar but i think we all would have preferred he not die before his time this is not to say the movie is terrible its still an above average action flick with some nice moments the sunset prison transfer is beautifully done and the scenes at waynes cocktail party border on subversive but the generally dour approach to the popcorn flick leaves me depressed and i cant help returning to the thought that a man gave his life for this maybe thats what certain members of an unspecified generation want maybe the imagination is so damaged they dont believe a movie character is killed unless an actor really dies i find the death of creative thought rather frightening and i keep coming back to an old horror catchphrase its only a movie its only a movie grade c  really a great film but does it really deserve 6th place in the top 250 an perfect action packed film with the emotional charge of a mosquito imdb publishes weighted vote averages rather than raw data averages various filters are applied to the raw data in order to eliminate and reduce attempts at vote stuffing by individuals more interested in changing the current rating of a movie than giving their true opinion of it my vote 1 10 just because the rating is flawed try thinking that mostly internet users are aged ~ 20 or less and ratings based on mere numbers do poor justice to films the masses never saw i just dont get it its not that i think this is an awful movie or anything but no2 look at the rest of the movies in the top 10 does it really stand comparison with the godfather or seven samurai i think not its a manipulative sentimental sunday afternoon movie raised above b standard by some quality turns by talented actors nothing more and who cares whether andy could put the poster back in place or not its a patently ridiculous escape to begin with i understand that most of the people on this site will have a pop at me for being a snob but the fact is i love star wars and lord of the rings and other blockbuster movies but if youre looking for a genuinely affecting drama this doesnt cut the mustard sorry guys but youre all wrong its not a bad film its just derivative and melodramatic it borrows from cool hand luke a superior film it relishes its significance too much its a bit smug morgan freemans voiceover is a clumsy narrative device i dont know i just know for sure its not one of the best films of all time not even close  its an emotional manipulation for dummies type of film with boring direction and cardboard characters nice performances by the actors though some great moments but nothing outside the hallmark meets stephen king meets prison feel of the entire movie i saw it one and a half times and would see it again only if i got paid for the trouble similarly i hated the green mile only later did i find out its the work of darabont my recommendation skip this and go see oz again i dont understand why this movie is so popular yes it was an interesting movie and it was a good movie but it was not spectacular enough to receive all the praise which it has the acting was good and the plot original but it was still a rather ordinary movie apparently im the only one with this opinion i may run out of words to end with less mindless witless a view of the world thats hopeless horrible acting writing editing lighting and music ive seen it all before only done better nicholsons turn at joker was far far superior ledger mirthless just a distracting concoction of tics bale who knows his augmented voice and masked face made his 2 dimensional performance meaningless dent what a horrible performance something youd see on knots landing where have we come as a society kubrick made a clockwork orange in 71 a devilishly clever mean and stylish film that pushed the limits when it came to on screen violence his young monster alex played by the brilliant malcolm macdowell was a thing to behold now we have families taking their kids to the 08 version of ultraviolence and yukking it up the dark night of america film making is more like it are we really this numb are we really this nihilistic  i wasnt so much excited about batman begins simply pseudo intellectual philosophy of fear was rather painful than interesting to me techno futuristic batman surrounded by oh my god cinema stars that have nothing to do with traditional batman characters was nothing special to me but this time i got excited 3rd trailer was absolutely great interesting interpretation of joker though vocally not so good as mark hamill but very original a little bit of darkness the dark knight reminding me of the dark knight returns that then i found out has absolutely nothing to do with the movie it was great but then then come the movie movie that is absolutely boring artistic like weird and is so full of light that calling it dark is an abomination if you want to hear the voice of batman who apparently sings in a death metal band go for this movie if you want to see gotham probably built and designed by ikea especially interiors go if you want to see bat cave so full of light that i had to dive under my chair to bring my eyes some darkness its the movie for you but if you want to see anything really dark atmospheric gothic simply batman like better remind yourself of things like batman the animated series 1992 or burtons movies 1989 & 1992 as you will find a lot of what batman really is there the real dark knight where word dark means something and knight is not meaningless as well the dark knight is absolutely soulless like ikea furniture and even heath ledger do not save the movie as his joker is enjoyable for first 40 minutes then becomes simply boring and all the same whats funny myself and audience around laughed much more when batman spoke with his dark voice death metal band vocalist herewego than joker laughed through the whole movie it doesnt surprise me much as ledger had the biggest problem with learning the mad laughter and although he did pretty well lack of it during the movie lack of single smile on jokers face made it all look very pathetic and then herewego with the plot batman decided to give up twice in the movie of course because he was afraid of what people think and self critique he apparently forgot that he started his obsession thanks to his parents death oh well alfred is dull and absolutely boring i start to believe that its just good to have michael caine name on movie posters lucius fox is ohmygod another star to have bigger commercial impact gordon was and remains not even close to what gordon suppose to be in my opinion etc etc finishing this counting out rhyme with the batman himself personally i love the way chbale acts i admire his role in prestige very much but here i dont see batman all i see is christian bale pretending he is batman sad my conclusion is simple nolans vision is far from what i consider as the dark knight and lack of darkness lack of dark gotham not to mention that gotham lacking of criminals who are too afraid to do their job instead of overwhelming batman with number of crimes is simply a blasphemy lack of darkness in batmans soul and then lack of taste and common sense in the movie are something that made me yawn and look on my watch for nearly whole movie apparently audience thought the same as nearly every batmans line produced fine amounts of laughter and maybe 10 people stayed to see first lines of credits just like they would hear herewego and decided to evacuate as fast as possible literally i know that the future will be completely different but i have high hope that nolan will never ever do another batman again please for the dark knights sake the story was ruined the ending was drawn out the whole movie was shot in this ridiculous this story is so epic i will pan around and everything will seem really dramatic even when there is no real action way it was like a parody of itself i can hardly believe people could find any of the worth of the novels in this self aggrandizing trilogy i only paid $3 to see this film and was wishing for my money back after what shouldve been the final scene of the movie there was this fake 10 minute ending where thousands of people simply cheered on screen it was such a blatant way of telling people the fabulous movie the tremendous trilogy is over lets all celebrate it was terrible i never write reviews for movies good or bad but seeing this movie in the top 250 list makes me mad its just a movie for teenagers who dont question why things happen when they just dont make sense i went to see this movie with great expectations because my brother told me it was great but after the first five minutes i knew what kind of movie i as was about to suffer one clichÜ© after the other with no characters development nothing gothic anywhere and nothing dark or mysterious about this talking batman either also i dont see anything great about the joker interpretation for me leger was just ok no need to glorify an actor because of his death the other actors were just as terrible as the script allowed them to be i really dont remember one minute of believable conversation between any of the characters for a movie to be great it needs at least to make sense its not that you cannot have explosions or great action but this film reminds me more of a bugs bunny cartoon where bugs can be anywhere when he wants to and pull anything out his sleeve i dont want to mention anything specific to avoid spoilers but just expect a ton of non sense action from a bunch of bugs bunny characters its sad how 100000 people cannot see beyond the special effects and tell themselves that doesnt make sense he was in that other ten places 5 minutes ago  dont believe the hype not good at all focuses too much on the jokerbatman is supposed to be a hero the old batman movie with nicholson is a much more satisfying movie watch this only if you are 12 15 years old and what is with the darkness batman isnt supposed to be like this it is like they took the worst of the 90s comics and made this movie out of it and i bet that there are a lot of you saying but it made all that money so what that doesnt mean it is a great movie wait a few years the micheal keaton batman will still be around this movie wont the acting is mediocre the action is ok but it focuses too much on the evil side watch iron man or something if you want a super hero movie from this year i give it a 1 10  its interesting to read statistics such as the word f_ was used 463729 times in this film apparently quentin tarantino needs to know how many quarters to put in his cuss jar movies are made to take the place of storytellers and when we sit adoringly at hollywoods knee we expect something fabulous not everyone can spin a good yarn and now we know that even our most promising film makers regardless of their inauspicious beginnings cannot hold our attention without resorting to gore and gimmickry films like pulp fiction 1994 written and directed by quentin tarantino starring john travolta samuel l jackson bruce willis ving rhames uma thurman and many other big names leave me wondering if prominent producers have just flat lost touch with their audiences parents and grandparents must also consider the larger view if a little pitcher accidentally stumbles into the wrong warren at the neighborhood multiplex his big ears will hear fascinating new words that might cause him to stay for a second listen but by the end of this loud red film hell be ready for the booby hatch i worry when hollywood dumps buckets of blood like this on to the silver screen im always afraid youngsters might see it heck im not sure anyone should see it i am disappointed in myself for falling for the fast talk and slickness ignored the wee small voice again i watched the whole thing and now my only hope for personal redemption is to try to prevent people with taste from having anything to do with this self indulgent free for all if i were catholic id probably have to go to confession just for having sat through this mayhem public forums are an excellent way for us film fans to inform these talented and powerful people that we crave clever stories told in creative ways and that profanity and blood are best served sparingly it is possible that quentin tarantino is a genius my hope is that his future work will be full and inspired and that he will begin to move toward the light pulp fiction is a dazzling display of drugs death and depravity and i advise you to see it at your own risk maureen adele compton post script i cant be the only person who thinks its getting worse theyre using curse words now that even people who do swear wouldnt have dreamed of using in public i will admit saying aitch eeee double toothpicks is cumbersome and probably wouldnt read well having said all that i could probably stand it if they would just stop using one phrase in particular you know the one i mean say it now pay for it later amen zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz oh man i will never understand the appeal of this pointing a gun at somebody cussing for 5 minutes pulling the trigger walking up to somebody else and doing it again for an aeon like 2 hours is not very entertaining to me there was not one stunt in this movie and the camera angle never changed and just when you think its about to end nope it has to keep dragging onand onand on i feel like a noose was removed from around my neck when the credits finally rolled why everybody has the poster the soundtrack and the bumper sticker on their car is beyond me then again thank the maker it didnt win best picture rating a much deserved exhaustive negative 1 out of 10if you make your way through the thousands of teens lord of the rings junkies and all the others who voted this movie a 10 for reasons other than a pure movie rating youll find that this is easily the weakest of the three films unfortunately pro it was a good movie and for the most part entertaining the characters are well cast the cgi is good in most places the actors are good enough to save questionable editing and the scenery is still breathtaking great effects in battle youll see worth the $10 to see but not really one you want to see again without having the ability to skip portions cons 1 way way too long and poor editing choices spoiler the multiple endings was totally preposterous and belongs in the extended dvd version for fanzies remember this is a movie not the book that time would have been much better spent on main characters that never surfaced eg saruman whom you never saw again and sauron who was reduced to nothing more than a lighthouse oh yeah i felt how dangerous he was you will get restless at the end of the movie and will laugh your head off as to how awfully campy and forced it feels especially when frodo wakes up and the silly canned laughter begins 2 too much time wasted at the beginning of the film as well mr jackson pick your choices of what to develop the love story and relationship between get any concern for the relationship too bad too much crap with merry and pippin please enough of the hobbit details crap and focus on the main characters honestly i didnt feel like i really cared so much about many of the characters because there was so much cutting between scenes and an incredible amount of time spent on faramir and his going mad father an odd area to place so much time 3 gimli and legolas again reduced to nothing more than comic relief and incredibly cool and unrealistic cgi hero there was practically no dialogue with legolas at all the reduction of these characters made me care less about legolas and made the girl i went with happy the one or two time she saw him but wondered why he was nothing but occasional screen candy 4 the movie felt very tired gollum again steals the show 5 some of the battle scenes were tired a lot of quick cutaways and not as much feel of the one on one combat like you had in the first films also very very poor display assistance of the dead it was as though they used up the budget for cgi and had this wave of green just end the huge number of saurons army in 10 seconds while the other characters hung out to chat it was like a comic strip video game honestly i didnt feel like i really cared so much about the characters at the end and felt like the ring was reduced to nothing more than an overblown reason to have a quest i truly think this movie suffers from wasted time at the beginning and end too many battle scenes and too little time to continue to develop the great dialogue and character development of earlier movies my rating would place this film a very good 75 but that is as high as id go definitely bring some nourishment wear comfy clothes and a watch im not a fan of this type of movies but since i like al pacino and ive heard so much about this so called legendary godfather i decided to give it a try i must say this is the most inexplicably overrated piece of trash ive ever seen the characters are all ridiculous unsympathetic and under developed the story drags and lacks any real conflict and dynamicsäó_ but the most disgusting aspect is the movies intent to glorify a bunch of low life criminals and turn them into larger than life figures into some kind of royalty this whole family tradition is just ludicrous were supposed to care about these characters to think that they are cool the major problem here is that theres no real conflict theres no redeeming value whatsoever theyre all despicable and one dimensional so why the hell would i care the violence which is particularly sickening is another issue but i guess audiences have come to appreciate it and its now a hallmark of the genre imagine the godfathers pregnant daughter gets beaten with a belt but guess what shes not likable either shes hysterical obnoxious and even worse she keeps defending her abusive husband in another scene james caan beats the hell out of someone in front of children marvelous thats just great not to mention cool and culturally relevant marlon brando speaking with a husky voice and cotton in his mouth is incredibly ridiculous al pacino as michael corleone suddenly turns from a principled man who doesnt want to have anything to do with murder into a ruthless criminal what this character has no depth no consistency whatsoever his relationships with women are so poorly portrayed they add nothing to his development its pacinos worst i cant imagine why anyone would think this is a great performance if you want to see a good gangster movie go watch donnie brasco instead after 4 years i still consider this the worst movie i have ever seen i have yet to watch any thing else with qts name attached to it everything about this film is annoying the presence of the ubiquitous sam jackson and steve buscemi the weak attempts at shock value the cameo by the director but the one element that makes this number one on my all time worst list is the obnoxious dialogue that tries to be hip and funny threes company reruns have better dialogue and i hate that show its such a shame though because qt and i do have a lot of the same obscure tastes in movies my advice is to try a project that tries not to be shocking funny or hip because pulp fiction fails in all three departments miserablyok first of all i happen to be a real superhero fan hell you should see the space used here to store all my comics so i usually dont have high demands for a superhero movie i like em all at least until i went to see dark knight that is i went expecting a superhero movie instead i got violence violence some more violence and to top it off some violence at some point i actually started to check watch hoping it would be over soon this movie didnt need a batman the way it played it reminded me off those old b movies you know the good guy gets ticked off and goes after the bad guys bad guys are usually crazy pure violent guys and you end up with 90 minutes of killing shooting and so on this is basically how the movie went first you have the joker who wants chaos and destruction thats is the entire story about the joker no debt in the entire character that is his only motivation and you never get to know why so the movie starts with the joker fighting everyone batman the mafia you name it this goes on and on and on when you finally think the movie is over and batman won it starts all over again then they add two face the only believable char in the entire movie but he plays like 5 minutes overall i went in with high hopes after 30 minutes i hoped the story would get started after 90 minutes i was checking watch hoping it would be over soon i think movies like that should have an lbo warning leave brain outside when i noticed the score this movie got i felt actually depressed and i really hope someone boosted this score by cheating the alternative is so horrible i cant even describe it so i keep on trying to convince myself the world is not as bad as that score tells me it isi was very disappointed in this film as so many people recommended this film as the greatest one ever created it was no1 in the imdb chart so i rushed out and bought it only to find out that i have wasted ä£12 on this very below average gangster film which went on for a full 3 hours if you want a decent gangster flick i would recommend either goodfellas or casino as the best in the genre what a load of hogwashabsolute tripe typical american rubbishoverratedbad acting you name it was theregive me will hay any daywhy people watch this trash i dont knowmarlon brandowhats he talking abouthe justs mumblesgive me a british actor anydaylet me sum up and say this is the worst filmi have ever seeni hope to god i never see it againi have been watching movies for thirty years and this is just the worst movie i have seenit typifies what is wrong with the movie industrywhen they can waste money on overblown claptrap such as thisif this is the best hollywood can offergod help uslets just hope it was just a blipand hollywood can again start making decent moviesokay so ive seen this now and i began asking myself how could this movie possibly end up on 1st place at imdb and how come everyone loves this movie ive seen this and its horrible i fell asleep after watching two hours of this this and pirates of the caribbean is the only movies ive fallen asleep to seriously and yet its so unrealistic like when don corleone is out buying fruits he gets shot like eleven times and still survives you would die after two shots from those types of guns also go see donnie brasco if you like gangster movies this is bad really bad wellwhere do i begin i have no idea heath ledger given an award after he died the man was a drug addict and simply went too far not such a great performance in the film actually mediocre but because he went tits up his role was portrayed as one of the greatest ever nonsense like i said mediocre as far as batman is concerned he definitely needs some throat lozenges what a crock with that voice they had him use it was less than halfway through when i lost all interest and forgot what the plot was if there was one the only reason i saw the ending credits was simply because of the fact that i needed some background noise for the evening you want some real batman watch the 60s tv show campyyes phonyyes utterly ridiculousyes but it was batman and enjoyable in one sentence the worst ever this movie wasnt a disappointment because i didnt expect anything better this pointless piece of shortened my life about 25 hours total waste of time and money cesar romero was much better joker than that untalented schoolboy if i could go back in time i would warn myself about this movie considering how this movie has been rated internet movies and television should be prohibited for anyone under 30 make the right decision dont spend your money minimum length for comments is 10 lines of text so i have to write some random gibberishok first i am a big fan of batman and especially batman villains to me joker is even bigger than the good guy and i have 5 elements that are the key to a great movie direction story music acting and atmosphere in the movie and the batman saga is all about atmosphere i watch all 6 batman movies tim burton was good joel schumacher had some good moments in the 3 but blow up at 4 batman christopher nolan is bad his batman begins was bad the dark knight isnt badits dead this movie is dead shore its a expensive project but do something with the moneyi dont wanna pay a ticket to see a trailer lasts 25 hoursthe story is the center not the stupid special effectsi love batman and i still believe in hollywoodbut he is bringing me down and down darkvery darkthe dark knight is all hype and no substance ive seen it 3 times and it is just plain awful basically it is too long and convoluted as all get out it felt 4 hours long to me the first time i saw itno kidding i guess the confusing part is worse than the long part if a film flows smoothly for its run length ought not be an issue but tdk is utterly messy and confusing for its running time so nolan wants a realistic version of batman then explain some things to us the big one is how does joker set all this stuff up at least batman begins was grounded in realism explained motivations techniques and plans and had a aura of realism after bb was over i remember thinking i liked this movie although im a burton batman fan i admit that nolan did a very good job with bb it feasibly defined a realistic batman world while still embodying a sense of fun and had a lot of entertainment value and the plot made sense but after tdk was over my impression was what the heck was that some points about why tdk is a weak film to me harvey dent swallows all that gasoline and isnt even sick enough to hurl he is badly burned but his rage and need for vengeance dulls his pain and he easily walks around and does not scare the bejesus out of anyone no one is shocked by the way he looks seriously nolan gordon and batman decide that dent twoface will be a hero and no one will know that he killed 5 people except for them gordons family and that bad cop ramirez im sure they will all keep it a secretplothole maggie gyllenhall as rachel dawes not attractive katie holmes from bb wasnt jaw droppingly gorgeous but she was fairly easy on the eyes and holmes worked much better in this role in bb had a lot more chemistry with bale and had an important function to the story when joker says that she gyllenhalls rachel is a beautiful woman i was like no shes not gyllenhaal is perhaps a better actress than holmes but holmes was actually much more right for the role of rachel dawes gyllenhaal literally has nothing to do and just doesnt cut it in tdk lucius fox played by morgan freeman who just exists in this film nothing else has the ability to do anything technological this includes constructing a sonar device that can scan all 30 million cell phones in gotham city simultaneously or did bruce wayne in his very limited technological training and experience do it either wayok yeah right whatever in bb the stuff fox was selling wayne at least seemed plausible in tdk it comes off as just plain absurd technobabble batman and joker get the crap beat out of them repeatedly chewed up by dogs fall from multiple story buildings and dont even get hurt when batman saved rachel they fell from the penthouse of a chicago high rise for cripes sake that must have been 100 stories easy no bones broken no trauma just ho hum back to business that climactic ferry boat scene is pure de hollywood manipulation it is there solely to reel the viewer in to make it seem like tdk is some kind of original provocative piece instead it comes across as sappy maudlin and empty the ending to that scene is soooooo predictable in general though tdk is choppily edited is populated with one dimensional lifeless characters is humorless convoluted as heck has dull dialogue and is very clichÜ© i mean its barely even a decent movie christian bale was great in bb but in tdk nolans hack direction and the script really let him down making him look like a laughingstock as a hero he was barely even in tdk and when he was in it you didnt get any feel for the character so well established in bb what makes bruce wayne batman tick what does he really want just based on one dinner where dent spouts about being a crusader wayne thinks that hes the one the savior of gotham city not very deep character development in addition to freeman you have michael caine as waynes butler accomplice alfred gary oldman as lt gordon and aaron eckhart as harvey dent all giving rather lifeless performances ironically i think eckhart has the biggest male role in the film but unfortunately dent is not very accessible and rather empty to the viewer really bale shares lead honors with oldman eckhart and ledger actually oldman and eckhart may have bigger roles in this than bale and ledger who wants a batman flick where neither batman the main hero nor the joker the main villain have the biggest role these skilled actors are unfortunately operating from a vapid script and extremely short sighted character development tim burtons surrealistic neo noir skewed artsy comic book batman flicks batman and batman returns are truly the best batman movies we accept at face value those films because burtons unique vision not only strived for something different for a superhero movie but also succeeded in a way that nolans films just cannot batman the bad guy who is hated by the entire city of gotham no way not in superhero world not acceptable and i dont care what these nouveau moviegoers so enthralled with this film think ok now i was a big fan of batman begins i really liked it but it wasnt really my favourite movie ever and the same can be said for the dark knight first of all whilst the joker was an interesting character and very well written to be honest i dont see what everyone is raving about yes heath was amazing but it gets me thinking was this due to the script or heaths ability to understand and become a phycopath if it really is the second should we applaud it did it live up too all the hype is heath the only reason people went to see it is it the best film of the year the answer to all these is of courseno and i dont understand why everyone is treating it like a god omg it was so amazing best movie of the year you see people this type of person is called a hype hound by the way thats copy written =] a person who bases there sole judgement on the hype surrounding a film and the first few reviews thats not to say there arent some true fans who really did love the movie but im sick of the pretenders giving it tens when they didnt even like it conformity is for those who cant think of there own free will free will is for those who break through conformity anyways guys my final words is a great movie but not the greatest will heath win an oscar yes will it win best picture well lets just see shooting killing shooting more killing some effect by batman doing his stuff the characters in the movie does not grow like at batman begin which was awesome every thing looks the same boring junk movie no surprises i really dont understand how this movie got this high review score nothing exceptional nothing interesting nothing funny nothing spacial just a really boring movie hafte 15 hours we decided to leave the theater which actually happened to me only once before this movie sucks big time do not waste your money and your time if you are a movie maker and you dont have new ideas for sequels please do not waste money and our time on stupid movies i rarely go out of movies in the middle this really really dont happen to me and i did saw all the fantasy batmanspiderman action heroes movies  disclaimer may contain spoilers sorry people despite all the unbelievable hoopla this movie is terrible the acting is wooden the story line is moronic the endless one dimensional tirades about heroes and anti heroes are totally childish and idiotic the much praised ledger in the role of joker is laughable there is nothing in his act that is worth mentioning as a matter of fact he was overacting big time and it made it painful to watch his presence on the screen the hand to hand fighting scenes were retarded slow as molasses compare the martial art in this movie to the martial art in the bourne trilogy night and day even batman and robin is more enjoyable to watch than this sorry excuse for an action film two thumbs down way way down humm i saw this film before batman begins and possibly it has better special effects i have only seen the first one it bits but and its a big but this film is very much a perfect example of what is wrong with contemporary cinema its garbage truly appreciate the quality of tim burtons batman by first watching this cart of steaming plops you might be the kind of person that doesnt give a fig about what you watch or you just want to see pure spectacle this film has spectacle and then more spectacle and then just as you are trying to follow what happened and possibly work out that the film is not that great something else will happen end result is a kind of mood average at that rather than any cohesive enjoyment in fact it is probably a bit worse than that even tawdry its not often i find a movie plain unwatchable but that was the case with the dark knight the reason is plain and simple almost every dialog feels fake as only 1 person speaks per camera point like with cheap soaps where they can only take care of the sound of one person or where the stars dont physically meet that much the lack of chemistry and realness resulting from monologues shot in series an then cut to dialogs is bewildering staggering low quality i honestly found it unwatchable because of that and whats even more bewildering is that this seemingly cheap or ill produced production is considered a master piece by so many i feel like the little child in the emperors new clothes whats going on here has everyone turned blind shockingly bad this is easily the worst superhero movie i have ever seen christian bale with his lisping american accent is the worst batman to have ever worn the costume and the digitizing of his voice only serves to make him appear more ridiculous this movie will bludgeon your senses in its desperation to entertain it is very very loud and there is enough broken metal and glass to start a recycling plant the plot is so fast and frenetic that it rarely makes any sense and just when it begins to it is immediately off in another direction plot threads start and stop every three minutes it seems aaron eckhart is a fine actor but whose idea was it that he should walk around in the last thirty minutes with half of his face burned off perhaps somebody should explain to the writers that burn patients who walk around exposed like that are highly prone to infection and dont live long yet this guy parades around like its just another day in the park with half his face missing and no bandages it was as grotesque and gratuitous as it was silly i guess its what you do when your movie doesnt have much to say the movie has an impressive lineup of movie stars standouts are eckhart oldman caine and roberts they are all very good but none is good enough to save this misfire and then theres morgan freeman is there any movie made these days that doesnt have morgan freeman in it he is so overexposed that he has become a bit of a joke he is also in one of the most ridiculous scenes in the film where he stands befuddled in front of a bunch of tv monitors this is another one of many scenes filmed with high energy and no sense at all as if all of this wasnt bad enough this thing lumbers on for two and a half very long hours arent we all a little tired of the superhero who is conflicted when i hear people talking about academy awards for this film it is a reminder to me of how the industry equates bigger with better if you want bigger this might be your film if you want better look elsewherei was expecting much more from this film with a imdb rating of 91 silly me and i was disappointed it left me untouched and uninspired 99 % of the time i found the dialogues and the script most of the time boring there is a psychopathic hyper criminal with mass destruction capabilities btw he would have to hire a whole army of commandos just to place and wire all that tnt gasoline barrels etc without anyone notice and the police and the batman are trying to arrest him or save his victims while we the viewers are watching their efforts for 2 and a half hours now what is the point to have fun sorry it wasnt much fun some sfx was good and thats all some other wasnt convincing at all there wasnt anything special to remember about this film nothing special in script in acting in action in sfx and most of all nothing inspiring and diachronic we should demand more quality from the movies not just explosions and killings with impossible enemies the money we spend and especially the time we spend to watch it should worth it we should exit the theaters with a feeling that we have gained something special not the opposite edit on a second thought 3 stars which i gave it initially might give the wrong impression so there you are 1 star for your lousy film try harder next timecmon folks if heath ledger wins an oscar for his performance then the academy has lost all sense of judgment what film full of that kind of horror gets a pg 13 rating i have read most of the comments on this side of the balance and must concur with all that i have read i just saw the movie just to see it for myself and i wish that i had my money and time back too longtoo gorytoo much of everything negative did dc comics intend for batman to be portrayed in such a manner i think not i really think something in wrong here in americawhen films like this get 9 10 stars ill have to admit i was not keen on seeing this movie just because i didnt really enjoy batman begins but i had some hope this movie would be an improvement and it was slightly i did like heath ledgers performance as the joker besides having no back story or anything like that does it deserve an oscar nod not really i think thats mainly out of the fact that he bit the big one earlier this year that and he was supposedly going insane whileor because he was taking on the role so i guess the acting wasnt much of stretch then was it i have to admit the direction wasnt very original or spectacular but besides that the movie was chalked full of big bang boom action scenes the scenes that dealt with dialogue seemed to be trying to make up for the lack of action with cheap humor that wasnt all that funny rachael dawes the most pointless character in the new series what can i say about her other than no one really seemed to care about her or her death the only reason i feel like she returned for this film was to give harvey dent a reason to go nuts and start whacking people which brings me to two face was it necessary to shove that villain into the last part of the movie like a bad subplot i think it wouldve been more appropriate for him to have his own sequel but i guess the writers really didnt think he deserved that i also feel like everything in the movie was so forced together i mean 3 villains in one movie and none of them hardly interact i mean you got scarecrow briefly cameo ing his way into the first little bit of the movie i dont mean to compare the movie to burtons works because thats biasedand screw you because i am but batman returns had all 3 of its bad guys smoothly fit together in the film was it really that hard the last thing i really did not like in the movie was christian bales i must sound like im an 80 year old woman who has cancer and still smokes after 60 something years voice other than those things the movie was okay does it deserve a 97 to be above the likes of pulp fiction alien aliens psycho grindhouse etc not really i think the movie has lost itself in the hype and most of the people who gave it a 10 did so because they didnt understand half the movie but thought it looked cool i think the movie would sit nice with a 6 or 7something rating but thats my opinion anyway i will be not be seeing any more films in this version of the series so you wont hear from me about it again even though i see these films as pseudo intellectual tripe intentionally made for popcorn peasants who equate style with substance and gravity with gravitas i think there is a something to take seriously about the effect the series is having on less psychologically stable individuals here is the problem no one really wants to equate horrific social acts with the ideal of liberty or the influence of the arts this is a problem because it is the essence of rational thinking to question aspects of our condition such as the possibility that the very things we hold dear are the things that can hurt and scar us the deepest there are droves of people willing to attack religious texts as a direct influence on violent behavior but seemingly few people who will even dare suggest that films can affect behavior in a similar manner yes religious writings are presented as truth where films are generally not but to a person lost in psychological disease there is probably little difference between truth and fiction the dark knight is a film where the central antagonist is presented as highly charismatic and successful in his purposes he is given a significant amount of screen time several stylized monologues and essentially tears apart all semblance of morality and meaning the protagonists cherish the joker is a glamorized nihilist antihero who wins in the end he is given all of the best lines is never contradicted and almost all of the filmmakers intentions seem to be focused on this one singular performance above and beyond all others he is also however impossible a creation a realistically and seriously portrayed one much like se7ens john doe or silence of the lambs hannibal lecter the joker is the ultimate role model for people who are antisocial insecure and disturbed he has been crafted with care and projected into the minds of any and everyone living in a society that is reeling from media saturation and spiritual and moral confusion like it or not we are animals living in a self made zoo and we are dramatically influenced by the media and artistic expressions we are exposed to from infancy through our development into adulthood at which point we remain spectators or begin to color the depths with our own dreams and nightmares but profiting egotistically and or financially from cathartic or theoretical expressions of violent and socially conflicted issues without acknowledging the potential for negative influence and therefore the serious social responsibility of such expressions is the way of our post modern world it is reckless and selfish and it is the american way i understand that the director of this film is british but the dark knight is clearly designed for an american audience we dont want to have any restrictions on our public fantasies as producers or voyeurs we are afraid of the assumed slippery slope from censorship to fascism and we hold the ideal of freedom above even the quality of our own lives we are taught not to value sacrifice and to drink deep from the abyss because we are irrational animals first and our morals are those of convenience we are not culpable because we are unaware given absolutely incontrovertible empirical evidence that films can desensitize demoralize and cause specific acts of violence to occur would we be willing to sacrifice our entertainment and our liberty for the welfare of the whole of the species absolutely not and why should we but we are not in control of anything we are not free at all and our ideals are no more empirically substantial than our religious beliefs the only solution for those of us who are aware and concerned with societal health is to attempt to illuminate others and force an acknowledgment of these realities so that we can attempt to cope with the inevitable moral decay mass secularism and technological progression are causing not that i could ever demystify the joker character for those who find him heroic or impressive beyond the superficiality of the actors performance but as an afterthought i am adding something i produced as a reaction to the disturbing level of influence the character has had on people because honestly speaking the character is an idiot for whatever it is worth the interrogation scene between batman and the joker in an actual intellectual though overly verbose film joker bla bla bla nihilistic bs bla bla darwinian pseudo truth bla bla sociopathic nonsense masquerading as deep social truism bla bla blaäó_ batman heres the truth pal we are both chemically drawn to opposing behaviors which we ultimately have little or no control over you are compelled to associate civilized humans as violent animals living a lie of illusory morals and to enjoy causing negative awareness and pain i am compelled to see humans as violent but altruistic animals by nature and to help heal the whole by attacking those who cause disease and pain like fighting cancerous cells in a body even as you mock the species for a perceived moral dishonesty you must rely on a type of moral perspective in order to justify your own position over the position of another your attempt to call people out on being flawed animals simply because you have a more introspective awareness is simply an appeal to your chemical predestination over the nature of others you have no point to make moral or otherwise once you have chosen to eliminate the idea of meaning from existence you are no different than a moth drawn to a flame you possess no special knowledge from which you can imagine me detracted from my own goals if anything i am more honest in my attempts to herd the flock into healthier areas of behavior because we are biologically a social species and biology is our master then batman smashes the jokers face into the table to drive his point home this film is bad in the sense that it is hardly a film at all it has no structure no dialogue no screenplay a threadbare story but one that is not told because of non existent direction etc it continues where the original left off and just notches off plot elements one by one without any urge to tell a story or develop characters relationships etc the makers probably conceived this as a filler between numbers one and three and didnt bother with it of course thats all right i dont have any problem with that but what really does disturb me is the high praise meted out to this film from almost every quarter äóñ from viewers and critics alike on this board its being rated as the 17th best movie of all time ive consulted quite a few film guides and they all tag maximum or near maximum stars to this film even more bizarrely they consider it to be the best of the series and in my mind its clearly the worst what is going on of course its not difficult to see why this film is idolized the first film was both good and a milestone not great but it was the perfect statement for an age it was a fairy tale that was confused as science fiction the force embodied morality even religion for the space age it is set in the distant past and therefore pertains to origins rather than where technology is going spaceships and laser guns are just the backdrop and have nothing to do with the story or the subject matter when this film appeared in the middle of the crisis ridden seventies it really must have been a beacon of new hope and to put the ground breaking special effects into its proper context they symbolized optimism there is no doubt that the effects served the story well but they served even better the mood of the age and with all this going star wars rightly became a tremendous hit and the focus of fanatic devotion it was to be expected that any sequel would have been gobbled up by the fan base as long as it didnt spoil the original empire doesnt spoil the original it not only continues the war between good and evil it does so with more spectacle more aplomb more special effects when people say they like empire what i think they really mean is that thy like star wars so much that they are thrilled that it has a new and glossy wrapping because empire is nothing but embellishment theyre not judging the film itself the ideal situation would have been if star wars remained as a standalone fairy tale fairy tales end and they leave us with the aura of happily ever after they dont go on and on and become sagas and if they did that would totally destroy the aura empire is the first mistaken step towards saga and that is why it quickly finds itself out of its depth there is nothing else to be told and thats why the film is so bad one boring battle joined to another boring battle and in between we have cardboard characters mouthing atrocious dialogue that serves no purpose whatsoever the strain tells everybody is straining to do something when there is nothing to do the third film the return of the jedi redeems itself by trying to finish a story the prequels are interesting because they are filling in the background but empire is caught in no mans land it is bad and it should be exposed as such all this pretending isnt healthy i dont think talk about a bad mainstream movie bad acting and terrible choices of scenes to have in the movie by peter jackson its a shame its on the 2th place when great movies like lost in translation is much further down sure the movie contains some really great effects and some okay acting but i mean the end oh my god was it really necessary to have 4 ending scenes if you still like these kind of movies why dont you guys go and see star wars at least their acting and characters is a lot more fun and those movies are also contains nice scenes relating to the time they were made this shouldnt be seen as an offense to either peter jackson nor tolkien because they are both great but still the movie didnt really work out ickash many people justify jacksons drivel by saying that everyone interprets the books differently jackson however not only adapted tolkiens story but created his own he removed tolkiens dialogue and replaced it with hackneyed banter he replaced scenes of drama and suspense with slapstick and hamboning the majesty and dignity of characters such as gimli aragorn sam frodo gollum and theoden almost all the characters really are reduced to snivelling whimpering and slapstick jokes arwen elrond and galadriel the most noble characters in the series are reduced to whimpering fools the disrespect that jackson shows for the characters makes clear the lack of interest he has in faithfully presenting tolkiens work tolkien after all related to his characters so closely that he had their names engraved on his own tombstone it is insulting to tolkiens memory to deal with his characters with such irreverence considering how much he cared about them its insulting to tolkiens memory while many dispute this i find the movies to be amateurish and the special effects are mediocre considering the heights of computer generated effects that other studios have reacheddespite the rave reviews it gets making a mediocre movie isnt really a sin in itself making a bad movie and claiming that it has any relationship to tolkiens work however is movie gets one star out of ten but its more deserving of zero that people have read tolkiens book and yet find any similarity or value in jacksons movies baffles me they are without merit being poorly made and completely disrespectfully adapted from the books jackson has not merely spit on tolkiens grave he has forever tainted his legacy with his awful interpretation of his work  okay i realize that this movie is considered by many to be a great film i understand that they are extremely faithful to the novels and this pleases many fans what i do not understand is how anyone can say this film is better than the godfather ii and even one spot away from the first godfather go take a gander at the imdbs top 250 and youll see that this movie is only marginally below the shawshank redemption i mean cmon someones gotta figure out a way to balance the rating system here all thats going on is these movies cult of scary and weird followers sit in their dank cold basements on the internet and vote these films a 10 when in the grand scheme of things theyre really more of a 6 7 or maybe an 8 im sorry but no matter how great these movies may seem theyre little more than a cgi fest of monsters armies and magical beams this film cant hold a candle to the intense drama of michael corleones criminal empire holding power in 1950s las vegas cmon imdb viewers lets keep the ratings reasonable this film won 11 oscars including best picture the return of the king is an awful film at well over three hours it is an exercise in boredom orlando bloom and viggo moretensen are completely miscast the story does not make sense and the characters are contrived it is like playing a bad video game so many actors are wasted in this colassal disaster peter jackson winner of the best director academy award seems as though he thought that his film was too precious to edit the film goes on and on and on weak acting all around the film relies on special effects to cover for a script that is completely pretentious the musical score is like listening to someone scratching a chalkboardobviously this was a faithless and pointless butchering of the novel but whats worse a terrible movie lacking flow sense linearity and dramatic impact this played out like a highlights reel not a coherent story the actors did an admirable job with the awful dialogue and nosensical personalities they were given with some exceptions peter jacksons only two abilities seem to lie in super close up and super wide out shots both of which are heartily abused and the special effects for the most part would have been better served by a cardboard set and some directing ability there were high points but this was and is the first and only movie i have ever left before the end and they barely kept me there but for the eowyn nazgul scene a hollywood blockbuster no doubt a good movie hell no possessing anything in common with the literature it is supposedly based on the fact is if this were based on real events i dont think the people involved would have given them to right to use their real names maybe that wouldnt be such a big deal if i didnt have to hear about jacksons love of the books or read reviews that discuss staying true to the source material there is hardly a scene or underlying theme in the movie that has anything to do with the books this movie could probably have been worse but i would be hard pressed to know howi honestly dont know what to say this has got to be the worst movie ive ever had the misfortune to watch and yet its getting such good reviews why anyone would give it a rating above 5 is a mystery to me is almost everyone on imdb just wannabe critics or is there actually something that i just missed while watching this i found it a challenge just to get through the movie never mind enjoy it my advice to anyone thinking of watching this dont it will only disappoint you there is no real plot or storyline and the movie is very disengaging characters and events are boring to follow and personally i feel that there are plenty more movies more deserving of the credit this movie is given does godfather romanticize crime and criminals yes it does take for instance the godfathers name corleone which translates as lionhearted suggesting that the heroes are to be compared to richard the lionhearted legendary chivalrous hero of the crusades and friend to robin hood there can be no doubt that author mario puzo and director francis ford coppola have made romantic idols of the corleones as the film gilds them with mystery honor and gallantry but of what holy crusade are the corleones the leaders seemingly a war for survival against vicious enemies who would destroy their gang but why should we care what happens to a bunch of evil criminals godfather is just as much interesting for what it fails to show the audience as what it does show the film makers wrongly assume that the audience is sophisticated enough to infer the kind of lurid but educational scene that made such a great success of earlier gangster films nitty gritty illustrations of the inside workings of organized crime loan sharking extortion and vice godfather for the most part ignores this subject matter the everyday business of crime in favor of what should be only the end part of its story a war between gangs over control of the rackets the drama is essentially without motivation the movie is simply not interested in showing us much of the dirty business that is the reason for the war that is because the heroes would seem much less chivalrous if their criminal enterprises were shown in any depth or with any real understanding for most of its length the movie plays as a revenge tragedy in which the gallant protagonists could be members of any great family whether criminal or not protecting their cherished honor why did the film makers deliberately sanitize the criminal aspect of the corleone family are they apologists for crime i think they are one confidence game employed by the film makers which is also familiar among the annals of organized crime leaders is a variation on the trick called bait and switch we expect a portrait of a ruthless and immoral criminal instead we are made to believe in the essential moral rightness of don corleone when he condemns as a contemptible enemy the kind of criminal who trades in narcotics in other words we are lured into the theater with the promise of a true to life depiction of the actions of a bad guy and then the film makers slyly pull a fast one and show us a good guy instead we are persuaded to ignore the fact that the godfather is an extortionist and pimp äóñ even worse we are asked to believe that extortion and pimping are not so bad especially if practiced by an honorable guy like don corleone who whatever his failings is much too decent to trade in narcotics this jiggery pokery was so effective that around the time the movie and its sequel came out an ivy league educated friend of mine on his way to a brilliant career on wall street bitterly denounced a critic of godfather for making the claim that don corleone was not entitled to be regarded as a great hero like president franklin delano roosevelt general douglas macarthur or doctor albert schweitzer who had received similarly adulatory treatment in film my friend having seen both godfathers was convinced that a mafia leader might be just as honorable as the heroic portrait the movies presented so i feel some need on this occasion to remind the public of what the mafia does even when they allegedly refuse to get involved in narcotics sales the mafia is mainly in the business of vice it feeds off the weaknesses of a mass of little people who are corruptible who are vulnerable to the appeal of easy sex cheap thrills quick money and quick fixes of their problems these little people pay for their vices all their lives much more than they can afford to pay and end up ruined for the greater glory of the mafia most racket crime is not glorious it is petty and mean and easily committed by anyone who has less courage or daring than the average person but its easy to understand why the film makers left this out of the movie it would be kind of absurd to call a scuzzy dirtbag by the name lionheart  simply put pulp fiction is the silliest film i have every seen it puts battlefield earth and the long kiss goodnight spookily starring the two leads from this film firmly in the shadows they look like rare vintage wines next to this cheap plonk the fact it is so highly revered by so many and even considered profound makes me fear for the very existence of modern society there are some fundamental reasons i dislike this film with a passion the first being the pacing and substance the film really mirrors its director to perfection yapping and a mumblin and a stumblin from start to finish enthusiastically aboutnothing if qentin was not such an untalented cretinous buffoon i would call him the new david lynch the only substance in pf is of the white powdery verity the film is just a collection of sick images splashed on screen willy nilly strung loosely together by some sharp but pointless dialogue the film was too crude made purely for shock value when violence male rape drug abuse accidental shootings and other such fun filled things are packaged as cool and even as comedy in the hands of an immature director you get a highly irresponsible film and to sell it as some sort of smart art piece is doubly irresponsible then there is the complete lack of character development and depth there are no characters only 2 dimensional machines created solely to perform acts of severe violence and drop in a few wise cracks they perform actions in one scene that seem to have no effect or relation to what happens in their next scene not one of them is even slightly likable or in possession of any redeemable characteristics apart from perhaps butch willis did i mention he is a violent thug murderer and a thief then there is mia who seems to have little purpose in the film other than an excuse to include the very uncomfortable scene where an over weight travolta boogies on the dance floor yes she is in the famous needle scene as well but what else the section featuring vince and mia was just dropped and barely mentioned again like mia herself so what was the point a question i asked of the film throughout i quickly realised that nobody in the film was there to be developed any one of them could have been dropped apart from butch or their actions performed by a completely new character without making a spot of difference to the film their actions were not to be the subject of scrutiny that would be asking too much of the tarantino who is clearly only interested in attempting to make stuff look cool he is the most unoriginal man on the planet only capable of tacky homage ie he is a thief action films dont believe me watch kill bill where he even pays homage to his own film this one i do give credit to him in one respect he realised that if he re jigged the order of plot events he could not only look artistically swish but he could disguise the fact that the story is not worth the toilet paper it was written on impressing upon many the fallacy that the hack job narrative structure enhanced the story the direction is experimental but quite frankly tacky and laughable at times one scene featuring a near comatose butch in particular comes to mind the camera is stuck dead still on him while marsellus rhames uses the m f word 100 times in about 5 minutes totally amateurish the only memorable performance is from jackson who could make the ingredients list of a packet of cookies sound fun he is offset by a flat performance from travolta that brings me to the witty dialogue which apart from the violence is the crux of the piece it is unfortunate then that this dialogue basically consists of idiots talking a load of nonsense about such deep things as cheeseburgers milkshake foot massages cleaning up skull and brain chunks and some coffee that is described as gourmet st some dialogue was witty but mostly it was just utterly pointless the characters deliver it with such perceived style and coolness despite the fact they were talking about frankly a lot of bs add this to the fact there is barring brief moments in butchs story no plot no emotion and especially no substance and you have one worthless film ah you dont get it they all scream dont make me laugh the circular narrative and the ham fisted attempt at redemption at the end does not equal substance the ending was hilariously cheap obviously a desperate attempt to justify a pointless 2 hour string of images in one strike is it meant to be profound well after sitting through the whole film which consisted of characters that were never developed adequately where no actions or events were properly tackled challenged or explored with any great thought or depth during which i was never required to care even once i was presented with one of the most cheesy pointless monologues in film history oh and a parody of qts fans the briefcase is opened and they stare at the shiny thing and go ooooh it beautiful it is all a hollow gesture when you consider the character that delivers the speech and his actions directly following it combined with the entire sequence of stupid events that precede it many movies these days suffer similar problems at their conclusion because of obvious limitations in plot structure and development some have endings that invalidate the rest of the film others have endings that are invalidated by the rest of the film with pulp fiction qt has somehow achieved both simultaneously youll figure out what i mean as a rule i dont usually let a films director put me off the film itself but after kill bill and pulp fiction tarantino films are now the exception  while the first two films of the trilogy where very good in my opinion the third one is a complete catastrophe in every aspect one can think of its attitude towards the book and without the book no one would have heard of peter jackson except few admirers moves between insult to ignorance almost no text from the original survives and the characters and scenes are terribly distorted even the climax scene is changed from the genius of tolkien to a bad holiwoodic clichÜ© the most disastrous is what the movie does to the character of frodo which from the original tragic hero becomes a stupid and gullible fellow which does nothing expect stupid things the go home sam scene should be candidate to one of the worse movie scenes ever other characters such as denethor faramir aragorn theoden or elrond are either inconsistent irrational stupid badly acted or all of the above in addition unlike the beautiful design of the middle earth in general in the first movie or of rohan in second there is nothing left from gondor except one picture of minas tirith and few fires it amazes me that not only this film is considered excellent by many viewers but that it is considered the best of the three sorry but i cant believe that this is the most popular film it dragged on for so long i didnt even see the ending dont get me wrong i love gangster films but this was so unengaging and that by the time al pacino shot the bad copper i had to turn off the storyline just seemed to be so pointless that i didnt care about whatever happened to the characters how stupid is putting the horses head in the moviemakers bed he knew they were dodgey gangsters so why did change his mind i cant think of any reasons why this was a good film if you do then you better tell methis is everything i dont want to see in a movie when i watch a movie i would at least hope for it to be more excited than my own little existence at my little house in the dead of winter id rather watch paint dry and its as if they did it all on one take the acting is the only halfway descent thing about it and thats because of the obvious triple a lineup this movie is very boring flat out i have seen more action and better writing in a spanish daytime drama there seems to be about 8 9 short films one after the other with only slight relevance to one another while me and my wife hated this movie we love all of the inside jokes we play about with each other now like how when we go out for icecream and we get a cherry my wife dramatically sucks and licks the cherry for 5 minuets making fun of the jackrabit slims scene i actually highly recommend watching this movie so you can see how horrible it is for yourself not being a dork or geek the mystique of these movies are lost on me so here is a review from someone that actually had dates in high school and didnt play d&d every friday night long lame sword fights to win a sword fight with the orcs all you need to so is step aside and cut them across the chest then as an alternate you can spin and run your opponent through i figure me and four other people could effectively wipe out a million of these lame fighters for this reason alone i give the movie a thumbs down the special effects were perhaps the best ive ever seen great monsters and landscapes is it just me or were most of the characters in this story gay just look at the way froddo looks at sam and vice versa pure lust in their eyes then there was this albino vulcan who always made double entandres toward a midget with a big nose he was obviously gay then there was the way gondorf kept touching the hobbits is this guy a priest anyway i give this movie a thumbs down it had the longest ending of any movie ive seen people were saying it it over yet but no it kept on going and going like the energizer easter bunny peter jackson is purely b list in my opinion there thats from a cool guy later i pretty much hated this movie its a prison movie so plot is basically tim robins gets framed than raped and eventually escapes morgan freeman is locked up and i dont know he just acts like a kid in this i understand hes suppose to be locked up since he was a teen but really hes giving the same performance here as his role as god in bruce almighty even though hes miscast he honestly carries the movie mainly because tim robins does nothing in this movie some other subplots include tim teaching some idiot to read or something some old guy hangs himself they deck a rooffreeman sneaks in a hammer and robins makes chess pieces ill stop the the point im making is this movie is excruciatingly boring number one on imdb are you kidding me even from a technical standpoint this movie blows everything is just dull and unimpressive hell it looks more like a tv movie than a film id describe the tone of this as disneys take on jail movies its to concerned with being safe and classy to accurately represent prison life everyones favorite part of this is the ending and that sucked too tim robins apparently escapes prison with a rock hammer after digging through his cell wall for like twenty years his hiding place is a poster really to make matters more hilarious he has crawls through a tunnel of poop and emerges from a poop lake in a failed attempt to move the audience morgan freeman gets paroled by basically insulting the judges than he goes to a rock in some random place that tim told him to visit and than goes to mexico and finds tim on a boat reunited and roll credits oh yeah morgan freeman also married his step granddaughter thats the dumbest ending ever written theres so much better stuff you could be watching instead of shawshank like porn or riki oh yes thats right crap this film is just that if you take a closer look at fex bruce willis who seems to make people scream their head off every time hes near the screen you can clearly see that this person lacks personality he has two expressions one that says on with a little wrinkle above his nose the other is of course off when hes asleep a machine of a man which perhaps cries a bit when he comes home because hes in desperate need for a personality some feelings a higher iq and an even bigger paycheck why this person has become so popular has to do with you mindless people out there voting cheering and stamping your feet for talentless and retarded actors musicians artists etc that is why this world goes straight down the toilette making your modern remarks that everything is so cool all the time pulp fiction is at best a bad joke from a below average director there is no inventions no good or natural acting no deeper meaning with this movie at all just exploitation the era of good movie productions are long gone classic actors like chaplin bogart cooper peck holden and quinn dont get born any more today its just you gray and unpersonalized people out there with some exceptions watching to see if theres something that can kill your brain even more with splatter and gore above your ears yeah youre a really cool bunch drowning on dry land sucked in by the tremendous hype surrounding this movie i went with eager anticipation as i waited and waited for something to happen in this long winded spectacle of gore i found myself laughing only to break the tension i was ashamed for finding humor in the most inappropriate moments of this film over indulgent pop icon quentin tarantino should head back to the video store so as not to inflict this kind of mess on innocent filmgoers again pulp fiction is a mess of a movie gratuitously violent and indulgent everyone wants to talk about the humour of going over a bump and someone being shot how hilarious is that this comment is meant to be ironic i note this for the hollywood saturated brain dead to call it a classic requires calls for major surgery on the definition the film is really just a sign of a sick culture stay away from it the irony wasnt lost on me the problem is that it was of the sledge hammer variety there are so many good films that i am at a loss to see why this is chosen for special consideration and to make matters worse the editor on this programme insists i use american spelling goodness get a life program with me on the end of it was still english last time i looked  this is a picture about mindless killing and idiots who think it is funny why so many people think highly of this picture is entirely beyond my fat rear end the fact that so many people rate this picture so highly does not say good things about our society in general when i bring up how disgusting this picture is to people whom love it i get a multitude of answers that amount to nothing more than academic masturbation some people have the audacity to say it is a comedy somehow i never thought mindless killing and standing around and laughing about it was comedy ha ha ha ha he just got his head blown off  that was so damn funny that i cant stop laughing other people say its a serious satire its supposed to show you the way the world really is wow like i need to waste my time and money to tell me we live in a sick world simply put if you like this film you need to get your head examined i hate mob movies and even though this is a classic the genre means it is less than desirable mob movies have one thing in common they are slow their main theme is character development and the characters they develop are not worth knowing this movie was terrible long and boring both my wife and i hated it i love star wars the old ones i am told i am just not a fantasy fan but i think i am just not a fan of badly done commercialized fantasy if i want to see a documentary on new zeland landscape i will rent it the movie should tell a compelling story with 20 characters and none of them even close to well developed i had no attachment to any of them yes i did not read the books i actually read the hobbit as a kid and loved it and remember it well i think they were just too true to the books and didnt realize that the books dont make a good movie unless you have read and loved the books call me the grinch i am not harsh on most movies all my friends love this movie and are avid fans i have no idea how it is anywhere in the top 250 maybe i could say this is a decent flick if you have nothing mildly stimulating to watch some weekend or need a decent rental my wife walked out of this movie i bared through it in the theaters just to give it a chance i would never rent it dont bother dragonslayer from back in the day does it much better and with triple the drama and action before walking into this movie i really had great expectations what with the rave reviews the movie was being lavished with and the seemingly awesome trailer and then came the moment of truththe movie was very ordinary i saw nothing special in this movie for me to even remotely praise it it was long many gaps in the plot in addition to scenes and story lines which seemed senseless and had no follow up plus there really was nothing artistic about it and it didnt actually have the enjoyable cinematic experience moviegoers would want to relish in this was further aggravated with the poor lines in the film in short the movie didnt get me all excited or sucked me into it throughout the entire film i was hardly able to connect to the film that said however i wouldnt recommend folks to not watch it but just an advice to keep your hopes to a minimal pointbad parts of this movie the action scenes sucked other than at the beginning the action scenes consisted of the joker saying something stupid batman hitting him the joker hitting him back and then walking away and something exploding in a good movie the good guy is supposed to be a little weaker than the bad guy and has to overcome it but batman has radar vision and can fly while the joker has nothing but a knife this movie was not inspiring what does it inspire me to do pay a british douche a lot of money so i can dress up in robotic bat suits and catch criminals speaking of the bat suit if part of batmans sacrifice is that the city hates him then why does he have a special uniform if youre supposed to be hated by everyone wear a ski mask and stop advertising yourself if you are trying to be loved by the people then you can advertise the movie created so many dumb unimportant plot lines and nothing ended up happening right after the love triangle the girl died that guy said he was gonna reveal batmans identity but nothing happens there was so much that didnt make any sense how does one guy in hong kong do the accounting for all the criminals in gotham why is it the biggest problem in the world that 5 people were killed in 5 days thats better than things are usually in big cities why dont the gangsters the joker is talking to kidnap him etc the joker wasnt creepy there is nothing creepy about a guy wandering around in face paint and giggling if he walked in to a bar cut a guys head off and then ordered a salad that would be creepy a superhero should be a superhero because he did something cool batman is a superhero just because hes rich good parts the creditsthis movie has toppled all the records and currently ranked number 1 on imdb rankings this really makes me doubt about how imdb ranking works and are we the people so gullible to the advertisement campaigns that we have rated this film this high i must say this that the film as such is not bad it is the best film so far this year however it does not qualify to even come near to other masterpieces if it is not for heath ledgers excellent performance i would have rated this film even lower to tell the truth i liked the prequel of this film better the film is lengthy and melodramatic eg the scene where inmates and civilians want to decide if they want to blow off other ship message was good but the way it was delivered is little bit childish also transformation of harvey dent seems sudden and illogical nolan should have developed this character better if harvey does what he does after the death of his beloved he should be avenging joker the most important part where joker convinces him to be an anarchist just like him is written poorly all in all it is a good movie excuse me but far from masterpiecethere are some things in this life we will never understand how did the universe begin what happens to our souls when we die how did a movie as bland as the shawshank redemption become so overrated in the case of certain other movies i can at least understand the reasons why theyre overrated but the shawshank redemption is so average and clichÜ© ridden the films moral is basically that hope is important and theres nothing wrong with that in itself heck i have no problem with simplicity the problem is when you move past the simple and into the land of the simplistic the movie treats its borrowed plot parts count of monte cristo anyone and banal themes as though they were freshly minted nuggets of wisdom i wouldnt be complaining if it didnt pretend to be anything more than a pleasant diversion however it is with its very last shot that the movie reveals its true condescending colours if it had ended moments earlier instead with that poetic shot of the sea i would have had some respect for it thats where the superior original story ends but no the director had to spell things out for his audience frank darabont knows how to tell a story he just doesnt know how to tell one with any originality or depth the movie is partially redeemed by three things the majestic cinematography the powerful score and most of all morgan freeman one of the very best actors working today as for my rating yes im one of those jerks who gives a movie a 1 just to lower it on the top 250 i think its outrageous how highly its ranked here even the folks who made it would think its ridiculous to consider it one of the greatest films ever made after reading all the rave reviews for this movie it turned out to be a real disappointment can anyone really believe that the prisoners are honourable men while the guards and warden are all crooks havent we overdone the hypocritical bible thumper  lets find a more enlightened characterization james bond himself could not have followed the main characters escape plan the ending soliloquy and denouement were inferior plagiarisms from cool hand luke enough unfortunately fine performances by both robbins and freeman were wasted in this fantasy story  shawshank redemption is overrated its a decent above average film but by no means a great film the inmates are pretty much likeable while the warden and his pet guard are monsters also as freemans character says you know that everybody in heres innocent as the story develops you feel like he is right the only criminals are the ones guarding the prisoners this is a sentimental piece made to stir the emotions but not to stir them too much just enough to make the viewer feel there is injustice in the world but that in the end everything ends well and justice surely comes to he who waits 20 years or so for it the shawshank redemption is as i said a decent film possibly among the top five films of 1994 imo the best films of 1994 are pulp fiction and lÜ©on  three words cool hand luke same film done better done earlier for that matter is this film any better than other steven king novelettes such as stand by me all in all it probably ranks a 6 or a 7 but since people on this site have lost their minds as regards this film i give it a 1 in one mans attempt at sanity  wait until you see the atrocity that is the dark knight and you will see it no matter what i say anyway wont you ive tried to keep this spoiler free despite the fact that whatever unpredictability the moth eaten plot has is based on the surprise being completely inexplicable in context so forgive me if its a bit vague in places the latest batman film lauded by fan and critic alike was apparently replaced at my theater with another similarly titled film in which iron man fought the killer from saw who is intent on reproducing the last ten minutes of spiderman ii over and over again everyone in the film is either an idiot or an omniscient genius but either way they are the most unobservant bunch of people ever put on film the whole movie would have sputtered to an instant conclusion if the city cell phone network had gone down and even the simpsons has lampooned the only bridge out of town and the first moment batman is on screen he is bending the barrel of a gun unto a u shape i think somebody was looking on the wrong page of their comics reference guide when they wrote all of the super strength + flying scenes in for batman this is an idiot picture there was no set piece in this film that would not have been avoided by a modicum of common sense honestly kudos to heath ledger whoever he was playing that was impersonating the joker as someone with no apparent sense of humor but any normal person would have shot the man on sight just to stop him babbling for the next twenty minutes every freaking scene was a monologue of the same thing everyone did that actually the characters seldom had conversations just extended monologues which aspired to be weighty and philosophical and not a word they said mattered because in the end it comes down to punching someone anyway the joker has only one trick and it is the same one three or four times bales characterization of batman and bruce wayne is so lifeless he doesnt even seem to have been in the film technically it suffered from being heavily edited apparently to obtain a pg 13 rating killings appear off screen or in obvious jump cuts events are alluded to which not only do not occur but appear to occur differently was this the airline version how long would this thing have been as shot it already exceeded two and a half hours happily there was plenty of opportunity for bathroom breaks every time someone opened their mouth you had ten minutes free still sloppy editing cannot excuse the way characters simply appear and disappear as needed by the script regardless of the impossibility of getting there unnoticed iits is essentially a plot device if this seems like a litany of nitpicks without mention of all the good points well as far as i can tell i mentioned all the good pointsthis film viciously wasted my time as if i was a character in it trapped in a theater with fifty hitherto unnoticed oil drums and the option to explode the audience of wall e it would have been a mercy iits its in the script thats why concept created by ken begg  i finally saw this movie because everyone kept talking about it but for anyone who has seen more than a few movies ie somebody over 20 there is just nothing there even without the hype i found this movie to be really painfully bad a few points  it seems the movie is trying to be realistic starting with something that looks like a somewhat believable heist but then there are so many totally improbable things like batmans hideout and gadgets the joker somehow getting zillions of minions etc so which is it a gritty crime movie or fantasy i cant tell  havent we seen witty dialog like this 100 times batman let her go joker oh very poor choice of words drops her out window when this happened my jaw dropped this is worse than a rambo movie  i get it that heath ledger playing the joker is supposed to be some crazy psycho hardly original or award worthy just looked like a hundred others we have seen before in other movies  all characters are totally off the shelf theres no depth or surprise to them at all  what does rachel dawes see in bruce wayne in the scene in the restaurant i own the place he seems like a braggart and feels the need to arrive at his own party in a helicopter with three arm candy women on his arm why isnt he already at his own place  oh look a fancy party in waynes penthouse i wonder whats going to happen look the bad guy comes in a starts tormenting people then wayne has to change into his batman costume to save the day how is this not 110% predictable  again is the movie supposed to be realist when arrested the joker would really be forced to wash the makeup off his face  bruce wayne saves the armored truck from a collision by placing his lamborghini in between it an on coming truck arent armored trucks stronger than sports cars yeah i know wayne has some magic tech so at this point we are supposed to suspend disbelief  i could go on obviously some people really like this movie thats great but please dont say its anything like the best movie ever until you have seen some films from the afis lists http wwwaficom 10top10  this movie is not great its barley border line good the only two reason i cant think this was rated so high was the extremely high budget on 3d animation and the fact that people are so easily enticed by the name and actors now i am not insulting the books as i have never read them but other than what i stated what makes this movie so great is it the acting i dont really think orlando bloom can preform any other role take a look at both the lord of the rings and pirates of the caribbean is it climax i think even the people who didnt even read the book knew that from the first half of the first movie knew that the ring would be destroyed is it the characters it had all the basic characters for all movie storyline the only entertaining and not bland character was golem what is it that makes you think its in the league with schindlers list and casablanca i dont claim to know what the best movie ever is but i know this movie dose not rank high in greatness it only high in its budget  one of the dangers of being too literal of an adaptation is that you start to realize when seen in a different format what doesnt quite hold up such is the case with the second part of the dark knight returns which dramatizes the third and fourth books in the 1986 graphic novel at least in animated form it is clear that mr miller bit off just a bit more than he could chew with a final chapter that expands the playing field far beyond gothams borders it doesnt quite work taking us out of the intended story and using it as a way for miller to discuss a broader commentary on 1980s american foreign policy the original story was of course written in the mid 80s nonetheless those wanting a faithful adaptation of the iconic comic book will get their moneys worth as a filmed adaptation it is stymied only by a curious bit of miscasting and material that just plain doesnt work as well on the screen as it did on the page for the eight of you reading this who dont know the story this is the second half of the story which contains two distinct halves the first half which was always my favorite portion of the story concerns the jokers reemergence in gotham following the return of his arch rival while the finale concerns batmans proverbial end game and a conflict with superman the idea of superman being a tool of an oppressive american government a devils bargain so that he could still function as a life saving hero is an interesting one and it was certainly a groundbreaking narrative concept at the time but this is just one of many instances in the story where the perhaps necessary loss of the running first person narration hampers the film and removes some of the character depth the films final moments do pack the requisite emotional punch but it still feels just a bit like miller merely wanted to answer the age old who would win in a batman superman fight more disconcerting is the out and out miscasting of the joker never mind that the role of the aged harlequin of hate is tailor made for tim curry who was first cast as the joker 20 years ago on batman the animated series only to be quickly replaced in preproduction by mark hamill michael emerson doesnt sound the least bit old oh sure hes 58 years old but he looks and sounds like a spry youngster barely pushing 40 this is the same miscalculation that had angie harmon replacing stockard channing in batman beyond return of the joker the performances are fine in both cases but the fact that the vocals sound younger than they should is a constant distraction there are some surprising changes to the joker showdown spoilers i suppose moments where violence in the book is trimmed no dead boy scouts at the carnival that i saw and increased elsewhere the escape scene is on screen and joker shoots lots of people in the tunnel of love we frankly lose the idea that batman is tracking down the joker for the express purpose of finally killing him which lessens the impact of their final moments together its still a kick to see the joker doing what he does best but it lacks the pathos of its source material also frustrating is the sheer amount of time spent on two truly pointless action sequences the opening set piece involving an interrupted robbery that goes on forever and the first real confrontation between batman and the new commissioner seem to have no narrative purpose the latter rooftop smack down is egregious especially as batman seems to attack for no reason even as he should be keeping his ears tuned towards whatever the joker is up to just inside the building and considering that were dealing with two 75 minute cartoons there was no reason not to do a little judicious editing and release the whole thing as one 135 minute the dark knight returns aside from getting twice the money from consumers peter weller makes an ok aged batman but sounds oddly like olan soule ie batman on superfriends during his climactic speeches still if all you want is a straight ahead adaptation of the dark knight returns then youll probably walk away happy save for a few nitpicks here and there the film is splendidly animated and both parts have enough iconic comic panels replicated on screen to give hard cores the goosebumps the more character driven first half gives way to a more visceral and action packed final half while arguably a necessary evil the loss of the voice over narration also resulted in the sacrifice of much of the character depth in the process now that we have both parts i imagine part 2 may well play better as the second half of one 25 hour film but thats a discovery for another day for fans of the source material and general dcau junkies this is a worthwhile purchase ive never thought that the dark knight returns was the be all end all of batman stories and i still dont but its a damn good elseworld and these two blu ray releases mostly bear that out  this movie is not worth watching most certainly not worth paying the full price at the theaters i cant believe roger ebert gave it full four stars this is another blow to my confidence in his reviews and ratings the bad part about it is that ill have to find other ways to get reviews before going to see a movie the first thirty minutes of the movie seemed ok when the characters and the story is set up some action here and there mixed with the jokers evil ways then at about the 2 hour mark i wondered when it was going to be over its got way too much dialog and not a good one at that whenever the cameras got a closeup of batman played by christian bale empire of the sun with the mask and suit on i couldnt help but marvel at his mouth and his pronunciations its the lisp its like daffy duck jay leno and barney frank the gay politician from massachusetts its like the austin powers scene with the mole on the guys face he couldnt get over it i couldnt get over it the jokers mouth and the way he talked also got to me he kept licking his lips while talking it was ok at first but when he has so much dialog with so much lip licking one cant help but wander off and start to think about how the studio actually inserted the licking sound every time he did it i was licking my mouth i prefer jack nicholson if i had been by myself i would definitely walk out of this movie but i was with three other people i even considered just going outside and waiting for them thats how bad i didnt like this film the only thing that makes this movie tolerable for so long is the all star support which includes morgan freeman michael caine the cider house rules gary oldman the fifth element anthony michael hall sixteen candles johnny be good and eric roberts runaway train but even with these guys in the film its pretty bad if this movie is the best movie according to imdb i think its time to move on to other film sites  in one word boring get the comments people make about this movie you have those that say its innovative and controversial others that its violent and refreshing others that say its a rebellious masterpiece yes you can check it out absolutely all comments fall into such kind of comments why i have a theory those guys have never watched a good movie and i mean it violence gosh this movie was only less boring than natural born killers the worst movie ever made dont worry i have a good comment prepared for that crap also there is only one really violent scene in the whole movie when the pervert binds the boxer bruce and the other guy i cant even remember who was and prepares to torture them i cant remember if he actually does torture them but thats absolutely irrelevant the situation the characters are put into is what really matter and bruce choosing the sword when he escapes oh my that was really nice the only good moment in the whole movie wanna see lots of fake blood watch happy tree friends but do you want true violence watch spoorloos paraphrasing it if you think killing is the worst thing somebody can do you havent seen anything yet its absolutely amazing that crimes like rape and kidnapping are considered less severe than a murder in our civilization okay a murder is terrible but nothing compares to the suffering of those that survive not only the victims but also those around them pulp fiction is about terminating people without a good reason nothing more i see no violence in some idiot blowing up a nameless characters head mtvs movie awards parody of the car scene was excellent they really got the idea this movie only shows more fake blood than most hollywoodian movies but whats the point if it created a revolution in cinema it was to make it yuckier i have seen much more blood in hellraiser which by the way has blood and violence all tarantinos movies are too shallow to show true violence too bad imdb doesnt allow voting zero for a movie i request to imdb please include 0 rating also atleast its soothing for people like us when they are able to express their opinion in the manner they want this movie does not deserve any rating at all if imdb group has something called best top negative comment for a particular movie then i request them to treat my comment as the top in that category that means i want my comment to be top from the bottom most of the time i watch movies only after checking the comments on the imdb website having seen such a good rating i rented this movie believe me not many times imdb comments proves so wrong this was the worst movie i have ever seen aaaaahhhhhh wait a minute i could not even see the whole movie all the time during the movie i was thinking that the good part is about to come but how was that possible good part would come only if there is any i am so surprised why so many people have reviewed this movie as one of the best movie they have ever seen total boring violent and logic less moviei went to see rotk for the 2nd time yesterday and aside from the myriad of minor flaws want to concentrate on major issues surrounding jacksons character development aragorn is the first big problem in the book he is both a ranger from the north but also a man destined to be king he knows who he is and he has an expectation of that destiny likewise in the book he has spiritual awareness aragorn is descended not merely from men but from numenor so he already has in him some of the blood of the elves now jackson gives all foresight to the elves making the men merely men but the whole point is that the man born to be king has the spiritual awareness of the great kings of old thus in book ii at the river it is aragorn not legolas as in jacksons version who is aware of a shadow growing in his heart and more significantly it is aragorn who in the book takes the palantir by his right gandalf actually bows to give it to him gandalf counsels him not to use it but aragorn knows who he is so he looks in the palantir and shows sauron the sword he challenges sauron and then wrenches the palantir away from the eye to use as he wills not as sauron wills in so doing he sees the black fleet and so knows the threat thats why he takes the path of the dead and when he goes under the dimholt he really summons the dead the exchange in the film between aragorn and the geoffrey rush pirates of the caribbean look alike ghost is feeble in the film in the book aragorn does not doubt who he is he calls them not barters with them now aragorns action here is part of a much larger cohesion in tolkien that is entirely absent in jackson as a result were left with a desperately anti climactic coronation why theres simply been no character development of aragorn hes been denuded of a sense of who he is sauron is the next big problem its true that in the book he is mostly referred to as the eye but he also has personality in the film apart from the opening sequence to film i which was brilliant all we have is a plasma lamp sometime searchlight since in the book gandalf has told frodo that sauron is taking shape again why on earth didnt jackson then develop sauron from the figure in film i in the book we are told of saurons gnawing doubt we hear of reports about spies entering mordor we know that he is consumed by fear of the upstart heir of elendil none of this is developed in the film and the ring seems to lose power on entering mordor not gain it result there was no sense of elation at the fall of baraddur now this is a serious theological error that i suspect tolkien would have detested personify good and you must also personify evil tolkiens epic was all about those forces being personified and how you discern them sauron is a personification of evil hes not actually the worst that belongs to morgoth of whom the balrog is a servant whilst tolkien rightly loathed allegory he nonetheless never would have countenanced such a weak and ineffectual portrayal of the enemy the whole point and if this isnt obvious in the world today then jackson is even less astute than i imagined is that evil in many guises takes human form others the same lack of characterisation in aragorn and sauron goes on with many of the others notable exceptions are gandalf and saruman both well acted jackson made a mistake in cutting saruman out of iii having made so much of him in i and ii more than the book arwen is drippy throughout eowyn is changed in the film miranda otto was excellent but jackson plays up the love between her and aragorn so much that we are left wondering how eowyn is apparently beatifically happy to see him with arwen on the subject of eowyn its such a shame jackson didnt do the slaying of the witch king better in the book the battlefield pauses a cloud goes up and everyone in minas tirith is happy its one of the truly great moments lost by jackson the reports even leak back to the orcs in the tower above shelobs lair so that sam and frodo hear that no1 has been done in as for the hobbits i think this may be a question of preference personally i think sean astins acting as sam is execrable but some like it for me the simple gardener becomes a mini philosopher and i find his soliloquy both at the end of film ii in osgiliath to which they never go in the book and on the mountain twice truly toe curlingly dreadful pap im afraid and oh dear we even veered towards titanic music moments at the end of film i and again on the mountain bilbo was fine until the end yes we know he ages fast now hes lost the ring but the salieri style prosthetics are poor jackson loves the slow motion work so much that we have to endure some particularly dreadful sequences with the hobbits most notably the already infamous bed scene and at the end where i really thought frodo was going to give sam a full on smacker a similarly tacky piece of directing occurs when the elves appear the soft focus lens is deployed with celtic singing argh this is kindergarten film production i expect the film will garner the oscars ceremony but i hope some people in tinsel town have the courage to acknowledge that whilst some of the visuals are outstanding though many are not eg the oliphaunt descent by legolas the merrick style leader of the orcs and the army of the dead the film is not actually very good peter im afraid youve let us and jrr tolkien downok i am not one of those people that hates films just because everyone else likes them i am not stupid i have two degrees a masters degree and a phd and i know a lot about films and agree with most of the top rated films on the imdb top films list however the thought of the godfather being called the greatest film of all time sickens me to believe that the only other film you must have watched must have been the people under the stairs the godfather is boring truly i love films but during this one i struggled to keep my eyes open i can take films at face value so i understand that maybe this film isnt supposed to be some fast paced shoot em up but it was so boring with so little character development and so little plot that i really didnt care what happened in this film ok so it is amazing how michael corleone takes over his dads role as head of the family why is it amazing who cares really there are so many other films with better character development i also hate the glorification of the mafias activities why should i be interested in how the son of a criminal and pimp takes over his fathers business and continues to terrorise and murder people if this film was about the the son of bin laden or one of the leaders of the bloods or the crips would people still be that interested i think that most of the people who like this film either like it because they feel they should or because they really cant justify their fascination with such a piece of crap and therefore revert to constructing deep and meaningful undertones to a film that clearly has none this film is a construct of the american fascination with the mafia and one of the longest on screen pieces of masturbation i have ever had the misfortune to witness if you like this film then fine but please like it for what it is a b rate gangster fantasy with no plot and very little character developmenti have to agree with those reviewers that find this film disjointed overly and unnecessarily violent and just plain difficult to understand i for one fail to see how this movie resurrected the career of john travolta as his performance was just totally unbelievable focusing on what appears to be several unrelated life experiences tarrantino once again utilizes his penchant for violence drug addiction rape and other assorted seedy topics the plot if you want to call it that is non existent and the scene involving ving rhaimes is just flat out disgusting for tarrantino fans this may be the ultimate but for me its just not a good filmthis is one of the worst films i have ever seen the actors are good as is the cinematography and the editing but thats that the script is a bunch of completely rubbish lines with no real meaning and special effects that have been done thousands of times and arent interesting enough to keep our attention the score is distracting the villain is the most implausible villain i have ever seen people who do evil things have purposes the joker doesnt have any even if there was a person like that s he wouldnt be able to have minions because that kind of madness isnt a shared one people kill for power or revenge or money which is another type of power basically they have to have a purpose to unite and do evil things all of the bs the joker said about evil and good completely miss the point about good evil and humanity they simply dont make sense and what makes me furious is the fact that a lot of intelligent or at least more or less intelligent people are quoting those lines as if they meant anything they dont and they arent even entertainingwhat can i say i gave this thing a 1 because i honestly have never felt it was all that good i that saw the average was a 9 at the time i voted and i felt the dissenters should get some representation brando isnt all that great in it i mean the thing is better than the average film at least im supposed to believe that but 9 out of 10 no way watch different movies in fact watch other coppala movies i personally like the outsiders and the conversation better i find the story to be boring i also think the structure of the script is a little too gimicky and amateurish i wont go into detail on this i will just say the thing left me dryhonesly couldnt see what all the fuss is about i felt this film lacked the very basics which make a good film good actors boring story and even worse directing perhaps this is because i only watched the movie for the first time recently and therefore am comparing it to the standard set by todays writers producers and directors i dont doubt it was a masterful production in its day but honestly the bar set by current movie makers really sees the god father sorely outclassed it is my conjecture that those who voted 9 and 10 out of ten did so because they remember how good it was in its hay day instead of comparing it to all movies past and present before rating itthis movie was horrible i dont understand how this is a good movie al pacinos worst movie marlon brando was horrible so many people say how good this is but i think this movie should be burned francis ford coppola is a bad director goerge lucas is the best director ever id give this movie a 30 on a 10 scale the best movie in the world is easily material girls hilary duff is so hot in that movie the screen play was bad the acting was bad and the director was bad a movie you should see is material girls the best movie ever good directing screenplay and defiantly acting another good movie was from justin to kelly justin is hot in his swimsuit but kelly needs to lose poundsthe movie was good but to have it rated as the top 10 movies of all time is absurd if you are a child or you like movies that you just sit and watch like a zombie this is your top 10 movie come on a superhero move being in the top 10 are you kidding me i cant believe people are putting it in the same league the god father ss redemption lotr the list goes on and on i have to say the graphics are some of the best i have seen the actors played their parts great i just thought there was not much story line if you like movies with substance i would wait until it comes to a movie channel or video this movie is good but not the best movie ever made not even close to being the best movie ever made why has imdb allowed anyone and everyone to vote this is insane prestige by the same director and cast is far far farrrr better the background score is a killer thats what sets the mood of the entire film the movie should actually be called the dark clown because the joker is just one of the best characters played on screen in a long long time heath ledger has the soul of the character in his grasp as for batman where is he i hardly saw him  im giving this movie a number one not so much thats it awful but that its completely over rated you people on here need to get a grip with reality it makes me sick to see how out of hand everyone here has become with the death of heath ledger i come across many fans of heath ledger who tell me how great he is this movie and how he was so talented and how they were huge fans oddly not anyone can tell me that they have seen candy or much less even heard of it candy is i feel heath ledgers best role so for all you fans of heath ledger i recommend you take a look see at that one look the dark knight is a good movie but better than the godfather it will never be no matter how many 10s you give this movie i saw batman begins and liked it although at the beginning i had a negative feeling for the dark knight i went to the movies with the greatest expectations after the big commercial that followed heath ledgers death everyone seemed to have liked it what a disappointment that was the movie is not bad but the critics make me hate it seriously i think that there are some movies ine the top #250 that are overrated but this one takes the cake from where i have to start the action scenes are nothing spectacular even tim burtons movie had better ones the music doesnt fit at the most of the sequences theres a repetitive tired to death theme that makes in almost every sequence thats the feeling i had batmans voice is like robocop is talking or something like that its not even clear what he is saying in some points i think it would be easier to say what i liked on this movie cause there are not many things i liked well heath ledgers acting was good although i think that jack nickolsons acting was more close to what i had in mind of joker character more sarcastic and funny in a crazy way heath made a good bad guy but he is more serious than a joker should be so why so serious avoid this movie there are a lot of better movies out there its just a trendy hype that i hope in some years will fade awayalthough suffering from a muddled plot ill defined characters a typically uncharismatic performance by christian bale and a lack of energy the dark knight proved to be on of 2008s greatest commercial and critical successes the fact that this film is in the top ten list tells me two things 1 most of the people who rated this highly are either 10 year olds or adults with the attention span of 10 year olds i do not mean to offend all 10 year olds because there are some rare exceptions but you can catch my drift 2 people who rated this highly have not seen many of the other better films on this list they have nothing to compare the dark knight to anyway i just hope this films current standing sinks down far below the 250 markchristopher nolan is a great director he several great movies under his belt such as memento the prestige and batman begins i loved these and so when thats why i went to see the dark knight i expected something great i heard people praising it as a masterpiece or best movie in 10 years so i saw it major disappointment i walked out of the theatre befuddled so thats what the hype was all about although ledger completely owns the role of the joker and he gives a fantastic performance that must be seen the movie surrounding it is at times mediocre the pacing character arcs direction and impact of the movie are all flawed the ending was pretty terrible too its not a bad movie and id give it a 7 10 but i must vote a 1 because of all the fanboys that are blinded by the hype a below average film which went on far too long heath ledger didnt completely fail at portraying the joker but to compare him with nicholson and favor him is insulting to both their careers hes essentially just playing a rather generic psychotic role in the mantle of the joker and cant really dazzle anymore after a scene or four christian bale is like a fossilized chunk of wood in his role as bruce wayne and as the batman just seemed to be in the wrong movie and desperately in need of some antibiotics michael caine and morgan freeman were fortunately able to add credibility to it all and when they appeared on screen the movie was actually pretty great pity though that they only got about 1 % of the movies screen time aaron eckhardt was given nada to work with and was equally wasted but who can really be surprised watching a movie like this just too many inane plot turns which just pulls you further and further away from wanting to find out where it all was heading i walked out after the 100 minute mark to get a smoke and just couldnt bother to walk back into the theater the evening was saved approaching a charming girl at the cinema bar serving ridiculously overpriced yet abhorrently tasting cocktails we ended up at her place and we danced to k&d until the first rays of morning sunlight found their way through the ragged drapes covering a cracked windowpane as she peeled of my clothes as if i was an overripe tangerine she whispered softly in my ear a mantra of passion film 1 night 4 months after seeing this film all i can remember about it was heath ledger as the joker everything else melts away i cant remember anything about growly batman or lame two face i remember that there were way too many characters played by elderly veteran actors and maggie gyllenhaal looks like someones elbow and it felt like the film was ending so many times only to launch into a whole new chapter i know this is how comic books are written but the sprawling structure doesnt work as well in a film the storyline was messy only one star the jokeranother example of an over hyped movie but now in extreme to say this piece of junk should be regarded as the best movie of 2008 is ridiculous basicaly it is just another movie about a man in a bat suit who duels for more than 2 hours with another badman with a painted smile and in the process some quasi profound remarks are exchanged no humor in sight to make the movie better digestible big budget good actors and some clever make up artists are no guarantee for a good movie in this case it resulted in a very boring one as for the so called performance of the year by ledger he is was a very good actor but this one dimensional role is far from being special but i guess the oscar will be his nil nisi bonum why this movie should be on par with or far better than true masterpieces like the godfather 1&2 and vertigo is beyond beliefi really dont know what is on in this version of batman which made the record for all time box office it was the worst the batman voice is very gay trying hard to be male in every superhero movies leading lady always be on perfect look but not on dark knight there is only one truth it was totally dark the story was adapted from spider man 3 lack of batman gadgets cast was boring i cant see any good looking cast on every fight scenes batman really obvious that it was handled by a real martial art expert and not the actor itselfi went to see this godawful turkey because the reviews were good and i thought maybe there was something there worth seeing but alas my instincts were correct it was made to be delivered to the faithful who prefer their characters flattened out and wrapped in plastic against a blue screen delivering the usual predictable crappy comic book dialogue there goes another five or six hours ill never get back one of the worst aspects of this movie experience was the ever present omnipresent ubiquitous portentous ominous and and and redundant symphonic music every single second of screen time is infused with impending dread christian bale stares longingly into maggie gyllenhalls eyes tremulous haunting minor chords christian bale glances away at the darkened spires of gotham slow crescendo on b flat etcetera i guess this film was just marketed too effectively i was convinced and went the first batman film starred michael keaton as wayne which was an inspired casting choice much like casting robert downey jr as iron man it would be impossible i think for either downey or keaton to yield up a flat performance in this case though christian bales performance primarily grim determination has been flattened out to match the furniture leaving only heath ledger and of course michael caine still standing as convincing characters is that enough to make the film worth watching its up to you but a i knew it was the last i would see of ledger andb the script for michael caine just isnt that good on balance i cant recommend it sorry folksthis one gets the one star it is a great movie but the fact that it is number one on imdb is just an outrage i think one of the other posters on here said it best let me clear this if a movie can bring freshness to creativity if a movie happens to change your insights if a movie starts a new genre gives away new techniques and styles if a movie makes you understand your heart better then i call that movie a masterpiece as far as i see the dark knight is far from it heath ledger was the only phenomenal actor this movie is unoriginal end of story until it drops below the godfather the good the bad and ugly and any number of other films that are just that bit better in an historical context this does upset me slightly as it is in itself a very good film as the other reviews say the ledger is dead batman fans just went a bit overboard with the 10 10 scores at the start leaving us poor schmucks at the back of the queue to mark it down to where it should be what do i think honestly well 7s on imdb are usually a good watchable evenings entertainment 8s are things you would make a point of staying in for tipping or buying the dvd and anything 9+ is one of the best movies ever made yes this one is an 8something for sure as i would go out of my way to watch it again but the scoring correction continues so 1 star it is ok dont know where to begin theres just too many things wrong with this dark knight 1st of all why does this movie have such high ratings because heath ledger died because if you actually watch the movie theres no reason for these high ratings the tim burton versions of batman in the 90s were a lot better than this hollywood plastic some random batman actions scenes a sloppy played joker that has nothing to offer than just to blow up police stations and hospitals wowhes such a clever joker he can blow up things i mean come on which part about this movie is good the atmosphere is not there  only 2 dimensions christopher nolan is doing his magic to make you sleepy because thats his magic gift to the world he can make me sleepy with movies like no other director but i guess im too old for this hype and only young people with really low iqs can enjoy this pile of rubbish i can only connect these 2 dots  1 low iq + 2 likes explosions = 90 rating on imdbwait and heath ledger died right yeah so imdb top ten movie right exactly this middle oddity is a very laborious experience indeed its all life saver battles with an added dose of averageness thrown in to pad it out a bit dirk vader is seeking luke shytalker or whatever his name is its something along those lines anyway because he wants to cut him down with a swift blow from his life saver if he does not join him in wanting to rule the galaxy as dull and duller maniacal space duo anyway it all ends with dirk confronting shytalker in a life saver battle to the death dirk swings his life saver at shytalker shytalker swings his life saver back at dirk this goes on until either shytalker gets his hand cut off or the audience dont care anymore thats about it really not much here for real fans empire is nowhere near as good as its predecessor or indeed its sequel jedi both of which are truly engaging this one is notamazing special effects have been used to mask peter jacksons mangling of the original plotline and script warning this film is a prime example of a brilliant book being americanised ie hammered into the boy meets girl girl loses boy boy and girl reunite format it has a couple of elvish words thrown in to preserve an illusion of adhering to the original book but with aragorns american accent often intruding this performance is hardly spell bindingits an okay film epic and all of course the fact that its an epic like gladiator or troy doesnt mean its good troy proved that fact and alexander continued to prove it with one star antics to be quite frank peter jackson is an overrated director much like the lord of the rings movies are overrated movies if you notice all three are located in the top fifteen films this one happens to be ranked higher than greatly superiour films such as seven samurai schindlers list and even casablanca this is not the case with camera angles that make you sick utilising the admittedly beautiful landscape of new zealand to help push across into our heads the true epic feeling of middle earth but wait where are the interesting characters every one of them you feel so bored with by the time the first film is up you seem to hope that theyd be dead by the second one but no they come along to the third one to kick some sauron ass heres my view of lord of the rings a whole load of walking lord of the rings fellowship of the ring points there walks lord of the rings the two towers points there walks trips up walks on lord of the rings return of the king points there walks throws ring into mountain walks away take those completely identical scenarios and pile them up with useless plot for three to four hours per movie depending on which one you watch and i myself wouldnt touch the extended versions you really get the idea that the academy awards truly are flawed why look forrest gump won best film of 1994 instead of the shawshank redemption or pulp fiction titanic won best film of 1997 instead of la confidential and why lookey here lotr rotk won best ing film of 2003 instead of mystic river perhaps next year well have the constant gardener as the best film of 2005 that may actually redeem the oscars failing reputation a reputation that had truly fallen when they took this half arsed effort of a movie and worshipped it as best film okay gandalf aragorn frodo are killed in the first ten minutes and sauron is king again that would be a good ending but no it drags on for another 3 hours and in the end everything is well and all goals are reached in between there are many fighting scenes where you easely get confused who is fighting against who and what exactly for the fighting is overdone and in all battles the good guys win boring and predictable the strongest warrior of the bad guys is defeated by an average female warrior it could do with some more drama it is evident from all 3 movies together that its a story about the eternal fight between good and bad but in these movies its never really explained why exactly the bad guys hate the good guys whats even more disturbing is the facial features of the bad vs the groomed faces of the good guys as if the storyline itself simply wasnt strong enough to outline that they are really evil the orcs have disfigured faces disfigured teeth drool and have a hissing voice couldnt jackon portray that a little bit more subtile frodo is attacked by a giant spider who has surprise surprise also a deformed face and only one eye on the left side of the head is this done to make sure 3 year old infants cannot mistake who is the scary bad guy it was ridiculous to see in fact i had trouble hating them at all i just felt sorry for them i understand its a family movie but this blatant deforming is an insult to the intelligence of people then theres the plot and the story it doesnt make any sense theres no explanation why faramir father wants to kill himself and his son or why gandalf or aragorn do not take the ring to mordor but trust it to little frodo who does nothing but squeel cry and hug sam in between why did the fellowship decide to break up and let frodo continue alone with sam while the other stronger fellows try to save peppin and merrin on with this movie gandalf and aragorn guess frodo must be close to his end goal in mordor but is held up by saurons watching eye so decide to launch a distracting attack with the last army the good guys have left what if frodo happened to appear a few hours later or a few days and sauron itself was a huge warrior in movie 1 but now only a flame on a tower why do the thousands of orcs stop fighting when the tower crumble they flee but where to it is just too unbelievable stupid in movie one thousands of orc chase the fellowship in moria only inches away but none of them harm frodo or manage to catch them in movie 2 they ride with 5 horses through 10000 orcs without so much as a scratch in movie 3 gandalf fights the orcs in mordor but suddenly stops for a moment of musing and while the fighting around him continues not an orc touches him or buries his sword in gandalfs white hair ive seen c class horrors that made more sense then theres the last 20 minutes frodo destroyed the ring but the end simply goes on and on and on and on lots of tear jerking twists appear and you simply start shouting please end to the tv screen in utter annoyance no this movie may have won all academy awards it was nominated for but it was a terrible terrible series the thing that saved this last part a little bit was the helicopter view scenery but if i wanna watch helicopter view scenery ill watch national geographic even the epic battles gave me a feeling of been there done that star wars gladiator ben hur they all done the same and most of the time better shot directed edited and more importantly more believable and the directing was awful the cinematography boring and predictable the editing confusing the score predictable the storyline infantile the acting without any exception terrible the lenght insane the events too much for fantasy the cgi effects hokey it is a childs movie a la jungle book it belongs on nickelodeon between spongebob and johnny bravo in fact there oughta be a law against peter jackson movies i said borefest in the summary but that was too kind its a nice series when you are a child but its outright trash if youre an adult the one aspect that made this one better than the other 2 movies is that there is finally and end to the endless walking and talking the ring is destroyed peter jacksons mega project too thankfully as a 13 year old just getting into cinema this was the best film ever how could i not be blown away by all the clever dialog great characters fantastic storyline and gripping violence it was just pure heaven i saw this movie three times in the course of one year and i still have such fond memories of watching it it was around the time i got serious about cinema about two years later that i felt i needed to give this another go id discovered the works of bergman tarkovsky godardetc and felt a connection with film in ways i hadnt before and i wanted to see if the movies i loved before still held up i had every intention of loving pulp fiction just as much as i did back then but i didnt there was nothing there no core all the things id loved about it were gone that clever dialog referential nonsense that gave no insight into who i was watching or attempted to expand the narrative the great characters indistinctive cardboard cutouts that act as mouthpieces for tarintino fantastic storyline a pseudo throwback to film noir that cant decide whether it wants to take itself seriously or be intentionally stupid for the sake of irony gripping violence its violence thats harsh enough to put the average viewer in awe safe enough as to not offend its a dead film with no ideas a common argument i hear in its favor is that its somehow objectively entertaining why because it has guys with guns and monologues about mcdonalds sorry but thats not entertainment in my mind entertainment is being engaged having to think a film like andrei rublev is entertaining because while i watch it it evokes thought and feeling it has something i can sink my teeth into i can still think about it interpret it in different ways pulp fiction is just shutting your brain off for two and half hours while a man with a god complex strokes his ego basically i can understand to some extent why it is so popular its very good at pleasing the masses something tarkovsky could never do its so perfectly designed to hook the average viewer in but its paper thin this is exactly what i dont want in cinema  not the strongest of the trilogy a lengthy drawn out conclusion it lacks the heart of the previous two and lapses on awkwardly with trivial and extraneous characters while he focus obviously should have been elsewhere i especially despised that tacky girlpower bit just goes to show directors actually can drag out irrelevant tacked on plot pieces and the ignorant hordes call it epic because hey its really longyou can pee 3 times get popcorn and soda refillsanswer your pagerand not miss anything most of the dialog is redundant expectancies of the end its got to end right however tediously and it is tedious with proper editing this movie could have been condensed into an hour butguess what the whole trilogys been padded so extensively for length so you can pay to see 3 not just 2 filmsits most obvious in this one wow this passes for classic  many critics cite the 1952 film the greatest show of earth as the poorest best picture selection in academy history that dubious distinction should now go to lord of the rings the return of the king which makes demilles circus epic seem like the greatest show on earth in comparison it was not only the academy but also the once relevant new york film critics circle that chose this film as the years best its a wonder that the ghost of pauline kael didnt use her after life influence with the all mighty to strike the entire group dead this video game like film goes from one chase scene to the next with little in the way of plot development ive seen all three films and dont have a clue what the fellowship of the ring is or the significance of the two towers nor where the king was returning from director jackson failed to include much in the way of plot exposition in nine plus hours of film the computer generated gollum was the most interesting character in the film at least he wanted to kill off those annoying hobbits ian mckellen is distinguished in his knightly role and added a touch of class to the otherwise endless stream of special effects the female stars of the film tyler and blanchett have so little screen time that it doesnt make sense to even have them in the film apparently tylers character is present merely to suggest that mortensens character is heterosexual why blanchett has such an annoying smile on her face each fifteen seconds she is on screen is a mystery to meno1 movie of all time i think thats what ruined it for me i sat down expecting to watch the most spectacular cinematic experience of my life but instead i ended up sitting rather bored for the good part of 3hours everything about it just lacked in moving me the vengeance was untouched parts of the story seemed to obvious and other parts just left untouched thoroughly this was the most disappointing film ive ever seen not the worst just the most disappointing im not trying to change anyones thoughts on the film or make out the film is bad just in case anyone gets the impression thanksfor years my boyfriend has been insisting that i watch this film finally i did big mistake my issues with this film are multiple the pacing of the film is just terrible its soooooooo slow and yet at the same time rushes through many things leaving many questions unanswered character development is beyond terrible especially when it comes to michael who goes from nice guy who is nothing like his family to sociopath with no shades of grey in between the relationships are also poor one minute michael is in love with kay the next minute hes in sicily and in what feels like 5 minutes married to apollonia then about 5 minutes later shes dead and hes home and married to kay before apollonia corpse is even cold smaller issues include the fact that michael seems to have a black eye for approximately a year either that or he spent about a week abroad in which time he managed to get married also would have been nice to know what happened to connie after getting beaten up by her husband clearly she must have phoned sonny i assume did she lose the child or is that the child that michael was godfather to if so where did michaels 4 year old son come from i guess i was asleep when that was explained or maybe id just lost the will to live all in all i found the film slow boring and rife withe cardboard cut out characters my tip avoid especially if you watch with someone who loves the filmi do not understand the hype this movie was nothing but a waste of my time why first i believe a movie should have a clearly outlined plot so that you know whats going on this movie doesnt feature that it starts out of nowhere with no apparent background and has a pointless ending there are indeed a couple of scenes that might be fun to watch if you are in the right mind however most are violent and immature and the actors do an excellent performance but that doesnt pump this movie up to anything good it kind of shows you the happenings of a few drugdealers and criminals within a short timeframe thats all to sum it up this movie has few redeeming qualities do something productive and more fun instead such as washing the dishes two stars out of ten the whole trilogy achieves to translate admirably well the deep boringness of the book replacing infinite descriptions with long empty tired repetitious and over emotional sequences totally misplaced considering the britney spears like deepness of characters characters are so flat and numerous that you waste half of the movie trying to remember who is who but it doesnt really matter anyway actions sometimes come to wake you up they are mostly entertaining but the most decisive and very awaited one is reduced to a game like greenish flow that is the only thing that happens to be fast in the whole movie be happy the end is near should be rated 5 to 7well i finally saw pulp fiction hadnt after all this time but ive heard so much ta doo over it so i rented it ugh i guess i must not be film critic material because i didnt appreciate the art of this film or its brilliance or any statement it might have made it was unpleasant filled with scumbag people i cared nothing about doing godawful things to each other with horrendously graphic visuals and appalling dialogue it jumped around in time circling back to where it opened but from another viewpoint and while that may be some sort of artsy crafting in editing or storytelling it doesnt save it from the fact that it was just plain revolting when the characters could get away for a second from m f ing all over the place there was some interesting verbal exchange bright and witty and even vaguely profound but kafka it aint i have to say i thought all the performances were incredible esp samuel jackson but cant quentin tarantino stay out of any of his own films even playing a nicer guy he comes off as a borderline psycho i thought it was very interesting tho to see chicago hopes eric stoltz in there as a drug dealer i worry about peoples minds if this is what they think of as a great movie eek a movie about redemption gee i didnt see any of that if perhaps a character got out of the violent melee alive id hardly call that redemption if they are hardly anyone worth caring about being redeemed in the first place an earthquake fault could have opened up and swallowed the lot of em and i would have applauded people think its really cool or trendy to give accolades to trash nowadays time to get some mouthwash for my eyes and get the stench out of emthe movie was based on a very bad book with a horrible language and style its no secret that the movie is better than the book but it doesnt make it good the story that turns violent ruthless criminals into men of honor and the horrible world of crime into something beautiful and almost royal its unnecessarily violent and why did brando put paper towel in his mouth i mean i like him as an actor but this character is absolutely ridiculous i dont understand how anyone could give an oscar for that film its just stupidthis movie is one of the few that i nearly walked out on it was so bad it was too disjointed and i could not understand the point or plot people were killed in one scene and then popped up in another lots of gratuitous violence and brutality that did not seem to have much to do with the plotthis movie is awful the ending was longer than any battle scene the entire final battle was completely meaningless the humans might as well have stood there because the only ones that did any fighting were the ghosts very anti climatic and the ending was about 35 minutes too long even the most hardcore of fans has to agree on those two points the only good part about this movie was the final battle it seemed and then the ghosts came and completely dominated everything therefore making the previous half hour meaningless i want my 3 hours of my life back and also my ten bucks in all the action was meaningless and the movie would have been much better had it been about 2 hours long topsshawshank is by far the most grossly overrated films of all time to say that this is better than lawrence of arabia better than alien better then saving private ryan is just ridiculous this movie is weak as are all the characters in it ill never forgot the scene where the old man hangs himself after leaving prison and the piano symphony kicks in why should i feel sorry for him try living in africa buddy and tell me how hard your life is this movie is for weak people who love to shed a tear for prisoners and overall just weak people now i love the director of this and stephen king but im sorry this isnt a masterpiece its forcing the audience into the characters emotional problems that few can relate go see the green mile instead rating = d videogamehollywoodcom you want to do something really neat take the movie pulp fiction and re cut it so that instead of being out of sequence it is actually in proper sequence it can be done why do this because if you do you will see what a nothing movie this really is there is no central plot there is no real theme or story or climax it is just a bunch of tricks and overly snappy dialog masquerading a piece of fluff that has as much depth as the kiddie pool hey more power to tarantino the guy is a houdini full of slight of hand but are we really so simple that we are ranking this one of the ten greatest movies ever made come on ok i know that travolta is cool and jackson is funny however lets reserve the greatest films of all time category for real masterpieces and real stories and not some overly slick pulp geared towards video store geeks  i really cant believe that such good actors like john travolta samuel jackson bruce willis tim roth and ving rhames have accepted to play this non sense movie and i also cant believe that quentin tarantino has created such no head and no feet filmwhen i saw it i got very disappointed because before watching it i had seen reservoir dogs and jackie brown two extraordinary films so i thought that i was going to find a similar film herebut unfortunately i did not  i rent the film because the fact that its #9 on imdb 250 list and my friend highly recommend the film so i watched it last night i couldnt believe my eye what a piece of garbage film making this is the whole film is mostly consist of boring & cheesy dialaue in which have at least a million f word in it the character sucked i never felt i care about them and the worst thing is that theres not motherfreaking plot i watched the whole film and did not understand what the hell is going on i cannot think of any positive things about this film and why is this film loved by many and get thumb up from the critics heres some of my theory 1 this is a very unique film for its time so people get on a bandwagon and start praise this film so whoever hate this film would considered uncool 2 pulp fiction is so bad that its good as mention before pulp fiction is a unique film its so unique that its hard to tell that its good or bad but the critics decided to call it good soon a bandwagon start the bottom line is do not watch this film dont care about what other people say if this comment doesnt convince you to stay away from this film then go to page 5678 there are other people who just hate this film as much as i do  the movie that defines the sensibilities of generation x that is to say its values are worthless the story is lurid and over extended the writer director is overwhelmingly self indulgent and tacky any revelations to do with christianity are twisted by tarantino to fit his obscene sense of morality the violence is absolutely incredulous and the originality to do with non linear plot lines and everything else is greatly exaggerated try watching some early kubrick to get an idea where he ripped it off hell try watching 50 other trashy independent exploitation flicks from the 50s and 60s to see how much originality tarantino has im not going to make any friends here as this film has obviously snowed everyone whos commented on it but who cares despite some extremely intelligent and powerhouse acting from samuel l jackson pulp fiction is a n experience not unlike having your face smashed into a urinal by a criminally insane biker in the bathroom at a race track between race four and five it is an offensive and disturbing trip through the mind of a filmmaker who is as far from being a genius as the earth is from neptune quentin tarantino is not orson welles and pulp fiction is a film which only speaks to a generation pre occupied with body piercing and anti depressants make no mistake i am more of an atheist than a christian but even i am outraged that people find deep meaning in a killer seeing the light and turning over a new leaf by letting the piece of garbage petty crook snake out the door with everyones wallet he has terrorized at gunpoint along with his wigged out nutcase of a girlfriend youd just wish tony minero would ice if he truly was making a spiritual point and sincerely trying to do the right thing hed have given tim roth his wallet told him to leave the bag and apologize to everyone on his way out off to a flawed start as a christian and the fact that tarantino lets us see that roth and plummers characters arent terrible people but just actors before they pull their heist is also a load of crap then theres the completely sickening la underworld psycho scene a personal tarantino fantasy to do with sodomy and a couple of hillbillies which was done much truer and to better effect in boormans deliverance does anyone truly come away finding this scene to be entertaining and if so if youre ever in my town please keep driving quentin tarantino is truly one sick puppy sure he does write some nifty dialogue if you can hear it amid the cacophony of mf and n words but as far as talent for film making goes he hasnt got an idea he couldnt act his way out of a box made of wet tissue paper spielberg gave a better performance in the blues brothers and visually he has nothing to offer at all if anyone knows his influences and he speaks of them often you will know how all of the people he holds dear and in high regard especially howard hawks would phone the swat team on him rather than invite him to sit at their table and to sum up my point what can you expect from a guy who prattles on and on and on about how great a film rio bravo is before any more gen x and yers announce to the world that this is the greatest film ever made please see some other movies beforehand start with citizen kane  bad acting ok story for the fans but i dont fancy this rpg trend crap i dont know how this movie ever entered the top250 movies of imdb should be ranked #500 best movie of all time or less my real grade for this movie is 60 but i voted it a 10 because lots of mindless people voted it a 10 and no way this boring movie is a 10 special effects dont make a movie a 10 out of 10 go watch the other movies on top10 list like godfather and shawshank redemption and then try to compare it with this piece of childish romantic view of common criminals in no way equal to goodfellas which really captures the truth about the underworld the director must have been fantasizing about some imaginary sicilian aristocracy drinking too much vino or simply mining a vein he knew would be commercially successful there are excellent performances by brando pacino and caan among others but the operatic excesses of the film make a mockery of reality the individual performances are wasted not unlike apocalypse now  the godfather is an arrogant film with little genuine substance and undermines an accurate understanding of the subject matter it substitutes a yarn for a true story and while it is entertaining it contributes to the deterioration of our culture like the gladiator it grabs your attention then tells you lies the godfather is the cinematic equivalent of baroque architecture excessive gaudy and not worth the work to create  i think it is the worst film ive seen in a long time and ive seen the original star warsthe characters are so annoying and i wished they all died at the end of the film i wised orlando blooms character legalos would be shot in the face with an arrow by lurtz also i think aragon should get a hair cut and have a shave because ll you see is hair also what is up with that little guy gimli he is so annoying he makes little jokes which are not even funny during a supposedly serious film the group always overact about everything what is the point of leglos saying blood has been spilt this night and walking right up to the camera this look very mincy how did it win best film award how did it win any awardalso the other two films were just as bad they could have cut the films lengths by half if they did not put in so much pointless chatter it would also help if they had real actors and did not rely on cgi so much  okay so they built a good villain in the joker but the plot was just a bit too unbelievable to hold together im not going to add any spoilers here but if you want a big budget action adventure escape that totally relies on the rendering farms that had to handle all the special effects and dont mind plot holes the hindenburg could fly through this film is for you imho this film doesnt deserve all the hype look at reviews from people who hated it and see why once the hype has died down and people get over their brainwash to overrate this over produced hollywood crap we should see ratings more in line with the films true value i didnt walk out but that was because i had such high expectations id hope to see this rated a 4 maybe even as high as a 6 by the average public im rating this a 1 to try to offset the obvious shills and excessive hype this is by no means the best film of the summer but in its favor it does give better balance to the darkness of batman if it werent for the growing trend in bucking the old feel good hollywood ending routine if it werent becoming clichÜ© to kill off good guys and create characters with seeming hearts of gold who turn half evil id say this film had something unique but that whole scenario is now a formula for making a film armchair critics will say has depth pffff save your time and money and rent an old classic favorite that you somehow never managed to see or go have a picnic with your loved ones the alternative is two and a half hours you wont get back dont waste it to further enrich warner bros a touch of reality is much needed for those who of late have occupied themselves in tossing about bon mots like masterpiece and crime epic perhaps never before have the expectations of rabid fanboys so completely bullied the critics into sheer lying for lying it must be since i refuse to believe that the critics did not see through this it is just not possible i feel that most of them simply cowed down before the staggering pre release fanboy blitzkrieg rather than provoke the inevitable backlash of acrimony from fans and thereby needlessly risk their careers this is the only explanation i can conceive of as to why tdk has seemingly scored so well with the critics i dont blame the critics though the blame lies in the fanboys hysteria their myopic refusal to see the obvious i feel that chris nolan tried really really hard to make a good film but ultimately even he with all his skill cant do much simply because of the limitations of the genre if viewers truly want more realism as they say they do then why turn to comics in the first place its just amazing how comic book junkies pull the wool over their own eyes and deceive themselves into thinking that what they read is deep and sophisticated when in fact and there cannot be two opinions on this reading comics beyond a certain age is a sign of neurotic behaviour and before you shove it in my face that it is me who is taking it too seriously let me just say that this movie was nothing but lashes of violence grim sadistic violence once again the so called realism is simply a pretext for the usual action movie gang banging ie violence and special effects and its not even just because of the genre batman begins rose above those limitations right one could empathize with the young bruce wayne tormented by his perceived culpability in his parents murder and struggling with his anger and loneliness not so in tdk here there is neither plot nor motivation to speak of and not a single character with whom one can even remotely identify the acting apart from one notable performance is mediocre to be fair the film does take certain risks which i cant imagine the likes of say a sam raimi ever taking it isnt a mcdonaldized blockbuster to the degree that the spiderman films and the rest of the comic book parade are the problem is that those risks dont pay off instead of an even progression of events that build up to a crescendo what you get here is one absurdity after another until you are numb and it no longer matters who is doing what i wonder if it is really so hard to tell the truth even only to oneself apparently it is indeed so difficult for all the fanboys to own up that the countless hours spent over the last several months sitting up nights staring at their monitors and devouring every last bit of inconsequential trivia about tdk have all amounted to a huge nothing tdk is the prime example of how the advertising business works today hyping up a product during pre release to uncalled for heights and ultimately forcing the gullible consumer to like the product against his better judgement the marketing behind this film is very much the phenomenal success story of this decade and should serve as a de facto case study for anyone who wants to understand just exactly how mob psychology works edit a more appropriate rating for this film is 4 10 but i so deeply despise warner bros & the people lauding this film ie everyone except me that i must give it 1 10 just to balance thingswellfirst of all the whole story and plot got nothing to do with the original comic book story which already makes it even more unauthentic and unwatchable then it already is the joker basically had some help killing the mobsters of gotham city along with other freaks batmans foes like him like two face poison ivy etc second the movie changed the whole atmosphere and story into a shallow script with too much special effects and cgi not mentioning big stunts and the same predictable and uninspired below mediocre kind of plot common to most action movies and comic based movies these days and besides the acting and direction were just bad and some characters seemed not convincing and stupid not mentioning the way the writers changed some important key characters like the joker heath ledger was just weirdhe didnt fit to the jokers role in conclusion a complete waste of time including your brain cells an endless and unwatchable crapfest an overrated and over hyped lame knight who is not a gentleman nor a good movie or a good comic book adaption shawshank redemption has been elevated in popular opinion to the status of masterpiece because of one irrefutable virtue it is accessible regrettably as is true in so many cases popular opinion is an inaccurate gauge of this pictures actual quality the reason this film has attained its current level of acclaim is that it is impossible to misinterpret its theme or message impossible to be offended by it impossible to be confused by however as this review should show it is entirely possible to be unimpressed by shawshank the story of shawshank redemption is something i might expect if i was being pitched a script by middle schoolers the complex coincidental frameup the daring escape the clear cut definitions of good and evil the timeless friendship finally and uneventfully consummated on a beautiful shoreline each step more unsurprising than the last each beat more clichÜ©d that the last every time the filmmakers feel like building tension or revealing something about the characters they take the most obvious road this might be excusable if the road didnt also lead to the most obvious destinations people also praise the acting in the film while it isnt at all bad its hard to be impressed when the actors are playing such simplistic roles stereotypes when acted well are still boring i sincerely hope that over time when the film has settled into history and once people are more able to set this pandering film along side its heavily plundered predecessors it will become clear that it offers nothing new and that what it does offer it doesnt even offer all that well  the shawshank redemption is a movie about a hotshot banker named andy dufresnetim robbins who is convicted of murdering his wife and is imprisoned in shawshank prison he remains hopeful and makes friends especially with a blackmarketeer named red morgan freeman i really dont see how this movie could possibly be the #2 film of all time the movie is nothing groundbreakingly amazing it is pretty poorly directed the plot is thinner than airthere are no risks takenand there is no thought provoked through watching the film that it only needs to one viewing to get the whole movie in fact you wouldnt even need to watch the film to even understand how the movie is going end the title already gives away the whole big finale of the movie i dont see how anyone could possibly compare this to actually great movies like everything that is below is on the top 25 and the simple thought of this winning best picture back in 94 hahahahahahaha it would have given me somethingh to laugh at for the rest of my life i still cant possibly see how the academy could have even nominated this as the best picture of 1994 anyway the only thing that saves the film of morgan freeman and it is only thing that even got me to see this film in the first place but it still cant stop me from giving this a poor grade 2 10  saying this is the #2 movie of all time is like saying mcdonalds makes the best hamburgers theyre both palatable predictable inoffensive products that are easy to digest both have happy endings that is if you find the stunning speed with which a mcdonalds hamburger flushes out your digestive tract to be a happy occasion all you need to know is that shawshank has the exact same ending as trading places so why not make trading places the greatest comedy of all time what the hell why not make it #3 on imdb it too is competent and utterly middle of the road in terms of quality and originality within its genre instead of dan ackroyd and eddie murphy laughing it up on a caribbean beach after besting the forces of evil we get morgan freeman and tim robbins its the exact same ending shawshank was ok when i saw it when it came out but count me among the backlash group that would rather see it with the 6 7 rating that it deserves thusly i hereby cast my symbolic 1 star vote awful a dreadful disgrace the film is the most cliched in cinematic history and is worthy of no respect even worse is how it is so flawless yet it still is of no quality i do not know how this film can be revered over others such as psycho apocalypse now raging bull easy rider the godfather the killing fields some like it hot and casablanca amongst others shockingly horrendousyes joker was really great but overall this movie was a total letdown a few totally stupid things that killed this movie for me spoilers joker blows up a freaking hospital in broad freaking daylight and makes his escape in an ultra fast school bus which no cop seems able to stop even though theyve been warned that joker will you know blow up a hospital you see this is totally believable because the cops apparently set up a perimeter two freaking miles away just to be safe its not like they could have used a helicopter or something for surveillance that would just make too much sense sarcasm batman falls several stories to the ground not once but twice and gets up without so much as a broken bone but hey thats okay because his super duper special armor which is so strong that a dog can chew through it protected him from the fall thats totally realistic right whats that you say the metal roof of the taxi totally cushioned his fall well thats even better how wonderfully realistic if i ever have to jump out of a burning building its nice to know that a kevlar vest and a strategically placed car will break my fall police commissioner gordon pretends to be dead so that joker will chase after harvey dent instead of his family huh and joker proceeds to kill six innocent people in the middle of downtown chicago uh gotham city but this is okay because by drawing the joker out the police are protecting the public from harm no reason to clear the streets of pedestrians and traffic and stuff while transporting harvey dent as bait for a sicko maniac killer joker manages to keep a pencil perfectly balanced on a table while a large gangster stomps across the floor to fight him cool but stupid joker burns a pyramid of money because you see money is not important to him whats important to him is blowing and burning stuff up which is exactly why he robs banks for a living makes perfect sense no batman speaks with an annoying rasp which hides his bruce wayne voice because as everyone knows christopher nolan wants this to be a realistic depiction of batman which is why we have sonar cell phones in this movie and magic armor and explosive laced bat mobiles that turn into motorcycles which do gravity defying 360 turns on walls other complaints there was no wayne manor in this film no bat cave chicago looks a bit too bright and modern to be gotham city seriously what is gotham city without you know gothic architecture the girl playing rachel dawes is completely ugly but for some reason bruce wayne is so obsessed with her that he decides to have sex with the whole gotham city ballet just so she cant go on a date with harvey dent i know lots of people got drawn into the hype of seeing heath ledgers last great performance but besides joker there is no redeeming value in this film theres no iconic battles no real hero to root for seriously you will hate batman in this movie christopher nolan gets a special mention for trying to inject at least some intelligence into a summer blockbuster but there was just one too many stupid things to justify the price of admission if you havent seen this film just wait for it on dvdi was expecting to see at least a semi good movie but this film is not even up to par this film gets a 1 rating from me because it tries to depict batman and fails miserably at it even for an action movie if batman hadnt been in it its not good the plot is horrid and morbid the amount of gore unhealthy and the fight sequences are badly done notable problems a what is this rock theme music thats constant in the movie it comes whenever a suspense scene starts and sounds like an annoying electric guitar what is this doing in a batman film also the plot seems to be totally disconnected in between scenes the entire movie is like one big mishmash of 10 different stories that occur in succession it is also unrealistic many times in the beginning the joker simply takes his schoolbus into the convoy to escape and the way he avoids police in broad daylight and blows up the hospital is unbelievable b the joker in this film is someone with a predilection for violence and violence alone traditionally the joker has been a nefarious insane character he does things that are out of kilter with normalcy he then laughs at what he does and takes unexpected delight in it this joker is not like so hes simply a disturbed psychopath who likes to blow up things and harm others theres no depth to the character c harvey dent has been traditionally black the last 2 decades that and the way hes made into two face in this movie is totally wrong two face traditionally goes on to become a crime boss but in this movie he simply dies soon after coming into being he also isnt a good two face overusing his coin flip to make decisions for example in the limousine scene he flips the coin again and kills the driver in order to eliminate a crime boss the real two face wouldnt have cheated like this once the coin makes a decision for him d batman himself doesnt appear much in the movie we are shown glimpses of him and the fight scenes are very darkly lit so its hard to see who and how hes fighting his over reliance on technology is also not good because batman usually uses wits as well as brawn the voice of batman is guttural sounding and bruce wayne himself doesnt seem to have any emotions micheal keatons portrayal of batman in batman made in 1989 is by far the best in all movies the dark knight is not just not a good batman film its a poor film in any genre i recommend watching batman 1989 if one wants to see an excellent batman film heres a small sample from this great movie thats better than the entire the dark knight http wwwyoutubecom watchv=sc249jpbbdywhat an over rated pile of toss oooooooooooh look at the effects oooooooh gollum is so real ooooooooooh id love to have long blond hair and pointy ears shut up you fools why cant people just watch excellent films and appreciate them instead of being tossed around by the wild current of sensationalism and hype all three of the films were at best average adaptations of the book but just because this is the last one it gets the highest rating its a travesty that rubbish like this overtakes actual classic films on an otherwise excellent database and dont get me started on star wars this is fantastic nonsense over produced and under thought bad taste is a far superior film stick with schlock horror jacksonand learn how to tie a tienow before i start i must first say i am no huge fan of the batman films and i have never seen batman begins however after going to the cinemas to watch this film i was surprised how good it is i mean the joker did the best acting there was and he was kind of funny however im afraid that was the only guy that did amazing christian bale did very good and im looking forward to his next film terminator 4 salvation however i thought his deep voice in tdn was a little badwhy did it have to be so bad of a voice anyway forget the voice its a good film but for the time it lasts 2 30 hours it could of been shorter and just as good but yeah 7 10 i recommend this film to anyone however it isnt one of my favourites why so serious i cant tell you how disappointed i am in the dark knight my friends and i waited for months to see this and it was a film i was expecting to see numerous times having viewed it i wouldnt watch it again unless someone paid me a lot of money im a science fiction fan so i on board with artistic allowance as long as its consistent with the framework of the film there were several violations in this movie that i dont understand how people fans can get past ill site a few examples that i feel cheapened the movie beyond repair 1right out of the gate in the opening scene since when can batman bend a steel gun barrel with his hands 2bruce wayne is now smart enough to network all the phones in gotham city and stick the results into a database last time i checked my phone didnt have sonar technology the phone that morgan freeman brought to hong kong was described to have special capabilities yet suddenly bruce wayne is able to extend that capability to all 30m citizens phones in the city the most idiotic part was when mogran freeman was analyzing the output and suddenly the jokers face appeared on the screen immediately in front of him did the joker stop by at&t before that scene to upgrade his phone there were about 500 mini screens in front of moran freeman and he just so happened to be looking at the one where the jokers face appeared i wanted to leave the theater at this point 3 if you are admitted to the hospital with burns on half your body and your clothes are saturated from lying on a floor with gasoline the hospital will remove and dispose of your clothes when you are admitted yet when the joker freed two face two face suddenly had his half burned clothes back on for the remainder of the movie 4who planted all the explosive charges in the hospital for the joker there seemed to be hundreds of devices that were suddenly in place and conveniently no hospital staff noticed oh and how convenient that the joker had a friend or a bomb in the right place at the right time whenever he was in a bad position something like this is okay in couple occasions in the movie but not in every scene 5what was the point in having the lamborghini in the movie just to be destroyed cheap thrill ledgers direct performance was great i just wish they had built a simpler more believable movie around him i wanted this movie to be great as much as anyone here i expect a certain level of consistency and believability from the movies i watch again believable within the framework of the movie as much as i wanted tdk to be a great movie i couldnt even will this movie to the level of awful i cant see what people see in this movie i did not like it because it is violent for violences sake and unless you think that is funny it is not interesting another movie from quentin tarantino that is just crude pulp says it all the writing is clever i wont deny that the cast is good what a waste of talent to put a movie like this on a pedestal is a sad commentary on our times it is hard to identify most of the characters unless you are a criminal type it seams in order to make a great movie all you have to do is put as much violence sex and the f word as you can and people will laud you there is no redeeming value in this movie this movie was not enough for even one star it had had too much of a plot twist and the acting was awful the only good thing about it was the fact that it had guns a blazing and john travolta in it if its one movie you want to watch in a movie store skip over this hunk a junki dont know what the academy was thinking when it gave the return of the king those 11 awards it did not deserve a single one especially best picture lost in translation mystic river cold mountain and even seabiscuit were all far better those films actually had depth and meaning where as the lord of the rings is just like titanic a bunch of shotty acting and film making covered up with tons of high budget special effects neither film deserved their awards and both in my view are among the most overrated and crappiest films in history i wish the academy would stop choosing the films that are the most popular or will give them the greatest approval ratingthis is a fantastic movie that truly defines classic cinema how do i even begin to describe the skill with which this movie is made the viewer is taken to a setting of violence in deception set within the scope of 1950s new york city in the beginning of the movie the viewer mistakenly believes they grasp the concept of what it means to hold a position in the mafia but this concept is quickly replaced with an almost uncomfortable sense of familiarity the story is told through the legendary actors portraying some of the most complex and meaningful characters of all time however i gave this movie one starbecause it didnt have to loganthis is pure sht movie without normal plot and characters only part which is funny is when samuel l jackson interrogates that dude in the apartment bruce willis has no part in this moviehe just sit around and rages about some watch which his father carried in the a during world war not to mention that stupid gay partno comment on that it was suppose to be a bad a ss movie and it was just pure sh it quentin tarantino go direct and produce some third class chinese shiy movies this was suppose to be in a bottom 250 movies not in top 10 people are so stupid and like shiy movies john travolta just dance in this movie and shot a guy in the face but nobody gave a fuk because its so stupid movie batman the dark knight is a tacky trashy mindless ultra violent piece of garbage it will bore anyone with a mature mind the dark knight consists of one sadistic pointlessly violent scene after another there is no point to these scenes except to extract money from the pockets of teenage boys who have had no experience of real life the dark knight is a drug it pushes violence and sadism thats it thats what you get for your ten bucks the dark knight is a sick product of a sick system whats the difference between a blockbuster death fest like this and an act of actual terrorism how many deaths do films like this contribute to how much suffering pointless ugly violent sadistic movies peddle violence as the drug of choice to mindless consumer hoards who lack discrimination life experience wisdom or balance teenage boys who spend all their time playing video games and having no experience of three dimensional reality see a movie like this and conclude that the world is like this cool criminals torture passive victims and meet no resistance hey thanks hollywood for flushing your refuse into young male minds ka ching how much more violent and sadistic will such films have to be in the future to make that cash register sing lets up the ante the plot heath ledger puts on a ridiculous series of ticks costumes and make up and tries really hard to get taken seriously as a master criminal master actor there is no real performance there because there is no real life there in one scene ledger a slight young man murders a very large muscular professional criminal and a black man äóñ white supremacists will like that part äóñ with a pencil no in real life that would not happen nor in real life would a man who shoots his every accomplice be able to do pull off any of the stunts ledger does in this film the movie is utterly implausible this wont matter to its fans who talk only to other fans who worship films like this as they do in their solipsistic computer generated echo chamber the dark knight is the greatest film ever made these fans have little contact with anyone not exactly like themselves and cant see any flaws in their judgment though saturated in violence these fans cant even see why a skinny guy like ledger murdering a muscular hardened criminal with a pencil is a silly nasty scene that exists only to up the sadism ante not to have any relationship with reality though saturated in violence these fans would panic at the merest contact with the real world with the real violence occurring in places like iraq or federal prisons christian bale is an interesting actor and was fun to watch in the previous batman hes hardly on screen here there is nothing interesting about the sets or costumes and as for the special effects how many chase scenes and big explosions have been on screen recently nothing new nothing interesting the intelligent viewer will move along or simply select a better film the godfather 3 oscars nonononononononono this film and its others is the worst piece of rubbish i have ever endured i feel that it was an insult to my backside who was forced to grow carbuncles under the weight of such mafia slush the acting is terrible the premise is horrible and the time is awful they made more than 1 yes were any of them good and im not biased i always watch things till the end to get a full view i even watched the others although i hated it no all awful all too long need i say more my view 10 10 let me tell you first and foremost that i have viewed plenty mafia movies not to mention i own several as well the first thing i have to say about the godfather that the entire plot is boring and drab its almost as the director is trying to make americans fall in love with criminalsnot to mention a bad display of italian americans were depicted in this film almost as insulting as goodfellas the question we must ask ourselves is are italians really that thick headed and vulgar and the answer is a resounding no you almost get the impression that vito corleone is a homosexual and that james canns character has a mental diffieciency the only good character depicted in the movie was al pacinos part a man who wrestles with his own personal demons family loyalty and the straight and narrow life i wouldnt recommend this movie to anyone and how it made number one is beyond methe only emotion it evoked in me was anger although it helped me to fall asleep which i thank francis for the following writing which you are about to read has little bits of things in it that might spoil the movie if you havent seen it which i would not recommend so please do not read this or see the movie this movie sucks this is one of those rubbish old mafia films from 30 years ago back when they still didnt know how to make them properly with lots of killings and foul language its just rubbish if i wanted to watch fat old men sitting around a table and talking for three hours id go to some place where they do that and watch them instead it doesnt even have any plots to it everybody just speaks in a strange language like im supposed to understand that this one guy in the movie is the worst heaving windbag ive ever seen in my life he even kills himself with oranges which is so stupid because oranges arent even poisonous please do not watch this film it is too rubbish for words although i have used words in what i have just said watch a proper mafia film like goodfellas or corky romano instead this movie is incredibly overrated on imdb top five film of all time what are people thinking half the movie was action & chase scenes if you agree please register and vote this out of the top 10 i agree it was an entertaining film but is it one film students will be watching in 5 years is it one youd watch 10 times i mean it currently outranks pulp fiction empire strikes back goodfellas etc it should be at least 100 rankings below where it is now when i look at the top 50 this movie sticks out like a sore thumb as not belonging yes ledger gave a stellar performance maybe even oscar worthy but a top 5 movie ever performance  warning possible spoilers here this movie is a monumental disappointment i had seen all five of the previous batman movies on the big screen and i watched as they kept getting worse and worse and worse i hoped that this one would break the trend and with all the raves surrounding heath ledgers great performance i really thought it would but it did not this movie is so trite and so absurd and what is most reprehensible is that it suggests that there is no good vs evil anymoreäóîas a matter of fact the movie closes with batman himself being chased by the gotham police and constantly throughout the movie batman now suddenly called the batman is seen as being the reason behind all the murders robberies and destruction the joker is perpetrating in gotham city by the way gotham city here does not at all look like the gotham city that we know it is chicago pretending to be gotham city which is very boring what happened to the stunning production design that gotham city is supposed to have as for heath ledger he makes a great impact in one of his first scenes in the movie when his sudden killing of a gang member serves as the punch line to a joke but after that scene the jokers energy totally dwindles away and he becomes another smart aleck philosophical killeräó_and even downright boring in an attempt to keep things entertaining with the joker the movie resorts to dressing him in a nurses outfit a cheap laugh to make a quick comparison the dark knight is very much like live free or die hard and a million other movies in that everything is on the verge of complete destruction and chaos at the hands of a villain and like die hard 4 when are needless sequels going to stop it tries to replicate the feel of 9 11äóîa real life tragedy that should not be incorporated into comic book stories like batman batman himself makes a pathetic showing in this film as he is much clumsier and more ineffective against the villains than ever before but then again why should he even try when everyone is calling him a vigilante killer when i was eight years old and saw the first batman movie at the theater in 1989 seeing my favorite comic book character brought to life in such a stunning way was a dream come true had the dark knight been the movie that was released instead in 1989 especially seeing batman getting chased by the cops at the end i would have been devastated now as an adult i can honestly say i am disappointed  ok i know i am not that well versed on all the action comics from which these movies are made but this batman was one of the worst films i have ever seen that is based on an action figure true the acting from some of the main characters was very goodthe joker by heath ledger and batman by christine balealthough his batman voice gave me the creeps buthaving seen the movie four hours ago all i now remember is car chases explosions a hospital being blown upthe noise was so loud i had to hold my earsand such intolerable camera work that i became totally dizzy and had to look away it took me a long time to know who was whomaybe i am slow to understand but the plot was so incomprehensible to me jumping from scene to scene that i kept looking at my watchwhere was the real fun that i remember even that old batman series on tv in the 80s was so entertaining robinthe penguincatwomanand the plot was so simpleno digital enhancementsjust good scary fun for the kids remember the on screen bam zoom kerplunk etc it was funfunfor adults as well as kids how could kids feel comfortable watching thisa gun held to the head of a little boyso much darknessand things blown away how this could be rated #1 in theaters is all about hypethe deathsadly of heath ledger who i thought was an unforgettable joker but a little scary for kids i kept asking my son who are the good guys and who are the bad ones it really left me empty the script was boringthe dialogue empty and the acting predictable i loved the fantastic four spiderman and the x men they had clever scripts and good character development in the dark knight there was none of this pleaseto parents out there dont waste your money and dont scare your kidsthis movie is boring loud and an utter disappointmenti do not care how much money it has made so far wait for it on dvd or do yourself a favour and pass on this mixed up melange of drivel  the dark knight is the worst sequel since highlander 2 the quickening i am dumbfounded at this entry into the franchise that was re invigorated so wonderfully with batman begins i speak to people frequently about this film and have had little opposition to my views on it ergo people dont like it i really think this film is the biggest dupe since the blair witch project i want to make it clear that i love batman bob kanes batman frank millers batman jeph loebs batman and the dc animated universes batman like many i found the tim burton and joel schumacher films excruciating to watch batman begins came along and christopher nolan gave us a batman we could respect and understand as well as believe we were then teased with the jokers calling card and ready for what was going to be the meeting of the the most famous adversaries in comic and screen historyand we gota joker with self applied makeup and no gadgets who is essentially a terrorist no batcave a batsuit that looked like a riot cop a convoluted scorsese like story about laundered money and a massive emphasis on factionalised and organised crime a two face whos only motive is a dead girlfriend a batman we hardly see and a gotham city that now looks like chicago but the enigma i cant stomach is that the film had no climax i asked many viewers what they thought the climax was and there is a different answer each timeoh it was batman confronting dentno it was the joker hanging upside down no it was rachel dawes being killedno there was no climax this films success lies only in the sad fact that its main antagonist was played by an actor who died during the promotional phase of the film in nolans attempt to legitimise the batman mythos he has made it sterile and boring my comments refer only to the 2008 usa release aspect ratio 235 1 widescreen version not the imax aspect ration 144 1 which could potentially be better sorry but the movie was awful not worth the money special effects aside gadgets and the batmobile which is a dream automobile the movie runs 152 minutes too long unnecessary ending but most importantly does not have any resemblance to the original batman series or the comic books neither in character nor intent best of the movie is the director christopher nolanhis attention to detail and superb sequencesie bus braking out of the bank the capture and return of lau chin han the explosion and the capture of the joker heath ledger the characters are very intense especially the joker bruce wayne batman & harvey dent two face the best and worst of the actors ill start with the worse morgan freeman and michael caine both accomplished actors they are probably two of the finest alive sir caine was the worst of the supporting characters neither of the two were convincing they failed in their craft both were consistently bad actors in this film the best was heath ledger hands down his performance was top notch consistent but above all spectacular there will be a sequel to batman the dark knight which sincerely hope will be betterafter first 30 minutes i was about to get out of the theater but i gave it a chance i left after 60 minutes great cast most boring plot i know that probably it has great cg overload effects at the end and all the good guys win i dont understand the actual rating for the movie i expect it to fall drastically in the next few days i suspect manipulation in here and it is a sad thing to see when the business takes over and the honest rating for the movie does not matter anymore great i want 60 minutes of my life back and the money for my ticket dont spend money on that dirt avrook unfortunately this is my first review here at imdb and it had to be this movie first of all i enjoyed batman franchise and of course start of nolans careerhe promised so much boy was i in a surprise after hearing media bragging the acting of sadly now deceased young ledger i thought ok nolan is back in his saddle where he belongs not only i realized hes not back but that hes discovering new depths of personal and spiritual descension christopher if youre reading this please take time and sit back in your comfy chair turn off the lights and start pondering on your futurethis is the point of no return choose carefully making good films or blah films like this and to people calling this artjust one remarkthe only art involved in this film was pr and nothing else filmmakers stop letting your financiers do the work your film should do by itselfexploiting someones death like that really makes my stomach churn chris come back to basics and satisfy yourself as well as true film lovers forget cashwish you all the luck mate ps dreck knights optimum grade should not be over 6 but i voted it 1 because it seems mucho people need a brain transplant the dark knights box office takings were recently overtaken by those of toy story 3 frankly im not at all surprised the disney picture blows this away in terms of sheer entertainment what christopher nolan does not seem to have grasped is the utter absurdity of the main character batman is a nut who runs round gotham city in a rubber suit solving crimes the 1966 series movie with adam west and burt ward got him about right it was played entirely for laughs tdk takes him very seriously indeed big mistake christian bale is bland as wayne batman and heath ledgers joker cannot hold a bat candle compared to cesar romeros and jack nicholsons earlier portrayals had ledger not been foolish enough to die just before the film opened i doubt whether anyone would have given it the time of day tdk also squanders the talents of the lovely maggie gyllenhaal brilliant in secretary the film as a whole is bleak ugly and depressing not my idea of a fun movie at all i think ill stick with the excellent tim burton joel schumacher quartet of the 80s 90s no more edgy batman pictures okay for a film to be 10 10 it really has to be almost perfect i know its all about opinions but to get that rating it must be technically well made you know entertaining good plot special fx acting realism etc oh and when i say realism i dont mean you cannot have superheroes or fantasy but within the framework of the movie you have to follow its own rules for example the matrix was still realistic even though people could fly it was set in a computer so its possible i liked the fact tdk was serious and dark but that is where the positives end the plot is ludicrous as the joker who is a human being is omnipresent clairvoyant a great hypnotist invincible and has no human needs i know this is a comic book movie but when you set up a film in a normal america city with normal physics and all that goes with it you cannot then just make up a completely implausible story of events the joker is beaten up involved in car crashes doesnt seem to sleep yet is perfectly fine at all times has a vast amount of mindless kamikaze henchmen who inexplicably do everything he says the joker is able to accurately predict where everyone in gotham will be at any time and able to somehow be in 20 places at once no one notices the huge amounts of explosives placed in the hospital or the boats or any building in town for that matter a man with a bomb and phone inside him is conveniently in the right place at the right time somehow avoiding the police metal detectors or dying from his surgery in the end the story is too unbelievable and too long as well you dont care about anyone as everything is too unrealistic therefore this film cannot ever be considered a 10 10 almost regardless of opinion i quite liked the filming and the mood of the film but it has too many flaws to be considered that good i gave it a 1 10 which is too harsh but i felt obligated to bring down the overall rating this comment is labelled as containing spoilers in fact it describes no actual events from the film but it does talk about underlying themes and it refers to 3 lines of dialogue read on if you wish batman has a new enemy the joker and a new potential ally harvey dent the new up and coming district attorney the film quickly develops into a study of good versus evil we discover the jokers motivation for the evil that he does he has no apparent ultimate aim he simply enjoys being evil the sheer senselessness of his acts makes him unpredictable as the film unfolds the forces of good appear powerless whatever they do there is a greater evil a more twisted motivation that they are unintentionally feeding the films title is in fact a triple pun it is metaphorically a dark night for the city and much of the significant action takes place in a single night by the end we are asked to consider whether good or evil are simply a matter of luck and whether truth as well as law are an inconvenience to doing good the film is therefore thoroughly postmodern it could be described as doing for justice what titanic did for love showing it to be worthy and desirable but ultimately unsustainable in the face of evil corruption and random blows dealt by fate there are some events in which good is seen to triumph but in hindsight these are plot contrivances to do evil would have been so much easier the film itself is also senseless in some ways the factors that made the joker what he is are never laid out nor are the sometimes incredible feats of anticipation and cooperation which allow the joker often to have an extra card up his sleeve ever explained there are two subtexts beneath the central theme of overwhelming evil one is intentional the other i think not the first one is batmans credo sometimes to do good you have to act outside the law the second is based on a line spoken by the joker where good and evil clash on equal terms evil is more powerful because the good have to follow rules whereas the evil have no rules the film is well made the special effects are very impressive the acting is generally good and its technically very well made but i found it disturbing and literally hopeless  you have got to be kidding me my husband and i decided to watch this piece of garbage on new years eve instead of a marathon of the office boy did we make the wrong choice how do people like this film what has happened to artistic integrity and plain old good taste the plot was disjointed confusing and ridiculous the direction was horrid even the actors who many i respect all looked like a bunch of sell outs who were in it for the paycheck gary oldman are you joking one of the greatest actors what a horrible role could you not keep your english accent out of gotham when you raised your voice dont you learn how to do that in acting 101 the highlight of the movie is when rachel blows up sorry to be morbid but talk about a bore that maggie girl should take some lessons from her at least competent brother can anyone explain the plot in 1000 words or less unbelievably all over the place heath ledger did a good job as the joker but please dont tell me this role drove him to emotional torment and insomnia i have great respect for him as an actor and feel so sad for his death i just dont understand what was so dark about the dark knight batman should definitely hang up his suit this is one of the worst movies ive ever seen it has nothing to do with batman and especially joker joker is supposed to be a crazyobsessed with money and vengeance villain who had an accident with chemicals not just an anarchist who doesnt like organizations and money and looks like homeless with paint all over his face and some scars two face isnt supposed to die he is supposed to be playing in another movie and come on now more people know who batman is except alfred batgirl and robin i am telling you this is not batmanagainst all that has been said in praise of this movie i just hated it cant we get back to real movies without all the special effects i walked out before it ended and cant think of anything i really liked how could anyone suggest heath ledger could get an oscar for his performance with his face covered in make up he went through the complete movie with one expressionit is a very dark movie in all senses of the word with little humour and a boring and predictable storylinethe same thing has happened to the new bond movies ruined by special effects and a desperate desire to look modern much of the humour has disappeared romance is hardly there not surprising as the females spend much of the time doing kung foo or shooting off gunsas for the music well all i can say is that it is tuneless which should make it to the top of the charts batman raises the stakes in his war on crime with the help of lieutenant jim gordon and district attorney harvey dent batman sets out to dismantle the remaining criminal organizations that plague the city streets the partnership proves to be effective but they soon find themselves prey to a reign of chaos unleashed by a rising criminal mastermind known to the terrified citizens of gotham as the joker we can all argue about the quality of this movie until the cows come home but this is what i saw i saw an extreme amount of violence in a kids movie its like making dora the explorer into punisher war zone and as far as flaws go this was jam packed there is this nerdy guy on tv who claims he knows who batman really is yet it goes nowhereit doesnt take an idiot to figure out that it would take a millionaire to afford that crap the cell phone gag was idiotic they actually could see everything including people who werent on cell phones & when theyre trying to find the joker they need to wait until he speaks another flaw that is pretty obvious is that a gunshot does nothing to the bat suit yeta dog can harm the wearer when the bombs are about to be activated the sailor only just finds out the thousands of gallons of flammable liquid in the engine room at that point i could go on and on about this but what really pisses me off is its place in the top 250so what everyone is saying is that its better than psycho better than the seven samurai better than alien better than seventh seal better than amadeus better than the matrix better than the terminator the list goes on so much that i could be here reviewing this film for days as far as acting goes heath ledger is the only performance that is descent christian bale as batman is hard to understand to me what i heard is ruta ruba runa roo this might sound weird when you say this review to yourself but say it in the batman voice & youll find similarities in both forms of dialogue hell this isnt even the best movie of 2008 iron man  the incredible hulk  let the right one in & hellboy 2 are the best because they hadyou knowthought put into it i realise this review might get slagged to death because i insulted everyones favourite movie apparrantly but in every decade there is an overrated director in the 70s it was copolla in the 80s its spieldberg in the 90s tarantino & in the 00s its nolan overall i think i have made an okay argument but i also expect fans to beat the living crap out of this review because its nolan & heath ledger died in shooting i can honestly say that not every movie that has had an actor died while shooting is a good movietake plan 9 from outer space bela lugossi died while making that & thats the same with this i am not comparing movies i would never do that heath ledger died but now they treat this movie & his performance like the second coming what happened to him was tragic but it doesnt mean that his performance is legendary the only time when a good movie has come off the death of an actor is the crow rating 1 10 worse dead movie it is unsatisfactory unethical things it does to your feelings not a good realization of science fiction dumb characters i have seen many good movies my expectation was that this movie would be good but it is not complete waste of time nothing i promise you get from it baseless ambivalent matters runs through the movie i hate and would rate is as the worst one the robot talks too much unnecessary junk talks the monk was not a necessary character disappointed with the relations of princess movie made her unattractiveas someone who read the lord of the rings 15 years back and has been re reading it ever since the movie just takes too many liberties with the plot the scriptwriters have introduced many twists that destroy the story and im sure tolkien would have been horrified if he ever saw this all in all a good action movie but really ruined by some very lousy scriptwriting plot deviations include the entire return to the shire is omitted so as to show the movie concluding with the defeat of sauron which just removes probably the most tragic part of the book frodo manipulated by gollum asks sam to leave him and go home in the climb to shelobs lair faramir decides to take frodo and sam to osgiliathout of nowhere where did the scriptwriters dream this up from and many others too numerous to mention such as tom bombadils scenes being assigned to treebeard awfulthis was the dullest film of the 65 films i have seen all year it took an age to get going after 90 minutes many people in the theater simply got up and walked out the rest were asleep i personally demanded and got my money back if people develop dvt through sitting through this then peter jackson should watch out what happened in the gollum effects department between two towers and this entry for the first few minutes that he appeared he looked like he was made of clay or silly putty dreadful effects i also find the actors in these lord of the rings movies to be totally unengaging and uncharismatic in the end i was willing frodo to die because i got fed up of his constant whining peter jackson made a big mistake dropping christopher lee from these films as he was the only one to bring any level of class to them and was sorely missed lord of the rings will never be remembered as fondly as the original star wars trilogy simply because it is unremarkable and unmemorablei dont wish to offend any one but to protect the integrity of the rating system honestly if you enjoyed the film it was more because you read the books and have been avid about the story for a few decades than it was its cinematic quality im sure it was wonderful for what it was but people was it really the second best movie ever released saying that the return of the king was of better quality than network dr strange love or any of the greats is naive its story is not its so if you voted so highly for its story than you were voting for the book visually impressive but think about the pictures budget so what was it than it was unoriginal and certainly not worthy of second best film on imdbpulp fiction is one of those movies you feel uncomfortable to talk about in negative terms since mainstream loves it the real killer of this movie are the dialogs supposedly so cool but instead being silly and irritating from the very first scene when endless minutes are waisted talking about a frivolous argument the violence in this film rather strong is very often disturbing but never fun or entertaining tarantino takes himself a little too seriously making the movie lose most of its ironical aspect unless you are a fan that goes wild for the overweight travolta you will find his so called cult scenes dull and of no interest all the characters in this movie are exaggerated and that wouldnt be a bad thing but they also are not fun there are some good action scenes very few which anyhow will not save from failure a movie that lasts 2hrs 40min i know all the fans of the books loved the lotr movies but i never could stomach the books never got more than 125 pages into the first one even though i tired a dozen times the books were tremendously dull and uninspired the movies were very true to this vision think about it for a few minutes what exactly happened over the course of about 10 hours of film a few creatures went for a walk with some computer animated battles along the way big whoop dull bored me to sleep if i could write ten lines about how dull this movie series was i might inspire you readers to the same amount of dis interest that these movies make arise in me i was enthralled by a lot of the scenery shots but the dull color palette used in most of the scenes was just as unappealing as the dull plot im not going to bother comparing this to another series of movies because i cant think of another instance of such patently dull movies being so universally heralded i wish some really good books would be afforded the lavish treatment these dry tomes got  ive waited three years for a disappointing ending the scouring of the shire wasnt in the film and that was by far the most important scene in the story with saruman and wormtongue okay so maybe its in the second dvd comes out after the regular one gets bought up but this is just a marketing scheme the exploitation of a fine story this proves once and for all that literary adaptations are a true rip off of the authors intent fixed only on making large sums of money tolkien is no doubt rolling over in his grave people against this argument no doubt say that well yes but it brings the story to the masses why not encourage them to read instead i feel that the imagination of millions of kids is now ruined because they will never be able to read the books without having wood in their minds as frodo or astin as sam and the characters dont act that way in the book and how can we justify jacksons liberal treatment of the story to promote cgi graphics while disregarding the characters in the film basically the computer is now a character these books should have been left alone this isnt the best film of all time it is the best example of exploitation that has thus far been imagined this film is long and dull as a result of the first it is dull for very long periods which is why this film warrants no more than a miserly 1 10 the acting is competent but no more and i must confess i lost my focus towards the end due to the quite shocking lack of entertainment that can be attributed to a poor script lacklustre direction and a plot which leaves a lot to be desired people say godfather is rare in that its sequel improves upon it but that isnt hard al pacino gained a big reputation from this one and i am left bemused as to why and this unfortunate idea has meant pacino a mediocre actor at best has been able to infiltrate our cinema screens on far too many occasions with a distinct lack of passion or charisma in any role he displays quite possibly the most over rated film in history never has there been so much made of so little it is an ok movie if you like discriminate killing and foul language and the glorification of gang lifestyle this movie hardly belongs in the top 50 let alone be in the #1 spot do you know what the saddest part of this movie is that it was remade two more times with the godfather iii being quite possible the worst remake ever im not saying you wont like the movie it is entertaining at times and certainly some very good lines have come from the movie i just cant stand when movies cant stand up to their own hype fortunately i only caught pieces of this trash on cable where the language and other filth were edited only some sort of strange perverted voyeurism can explain why the redemption of assassins sodomites and other sociopaths garners such attention or perhaps most of the movie going public is not that far removed from the experiences of these miscreants and any message of unburdened hope is received with resounding aplomb the next thing we know people will be claiming pornography possesses redeeming cultural qualities and oscar performances befitting the publicks adulations or has boogie nights already claimed that role whatever the case pulp friction is just another post modern nihilistic romp i guess i can take comfort in the fact that my 1 out of 10 stars vote will depress the rating of this film even though the usefulness of my comment will get many no votes so go ahead and vote away and confirm my suspicions your favorite movie still has a 1 vote in imdb from me and i enjoy watching them add up last count 11 people found my comment unusefulthe lord of the rings return of the king is certainly this centurys masterpiece it has everything that a person could want in a film it has an amazing story impressive special effects top quality acting and some of the best cinematography of the past years it will scare you it will make you cry it will make you laugh and jump with joy and gasp at the immense scale of the epic tale this is the film that over ran films such as star wars and citizen kane as everyone in the world should be made to watch it it is a film that will be around for hundreds of years and will continue to amaze people even then a truly amazing filmi finally got around to watching this bc everyone praised it except my parents they told me not to watch it and i disregarded their opinion boy what an idiot i was this indeed was not the best movie ever but the worst this movie had no point jumped all over the place said f way too many times and waaaaay to long for something that had no point qt is not a genius for making this movie a moron if u ask me i really wish i could hit him in the face for me wasting 2hrs of my life on this crappy movie this movie deserves a 1 10 for its unoriginal plot if it had one terrible script and why does qt have to play a part in his movies he cannot actthis movie was more boring than church they just talked and talked they hardly ever shot anybody michael corleone is a little girly man and that sonny guy no one intimidating is named sonny when he got blown to bits i laughedhard then theres vito whats with this guy does he have marshmallows stuffed in his mouth why does he look like that and whats with that namevito who names thier son after a presidential command it could only be one typed of people hillbillies italian mafia hillbillies if you want a real good movie go see santa with muscles hell stop them corleones 1 out of 10 that was to lower its stupid ridiculously high average but to put it quite simply i hated this movie i didnt expect to like it i was only watching it for frank whaley but i hated this movie really hated with it with its various plot holes that do not make sensewatch short cuts if you want to see a decent movies about the interrelating lives of people obnoxious unsympathetic charactersi wanted to cheer when john travolta died or did he die i had no idea since the film epitomized non sense making someone died and i didnt like any of the characters with the exception of whaleys so i would still have wanted to cheer bad writing with obvious attempts at being cool and trying to have catch phrases etc etc etc i found nothing good about this film in the least so why did critics i hate when violent immoral films are regarded as daring  good film making this one sure wasnt and nominating john travolta and samuel l jackson for acting awards the first one is just absurd and the second has proven to me that he can act but the only thing he was acting in this film was obnoxious this one is up there with born on the fourth of july and do the right thing for my least favorite good movie  yeah great looking but really boring boring and boring movie giving such a great ratings for this masterpiece is eating the top movie list since this really isnt great movie just nice arts etc but nothing more the first two were even better than this one this is all just about how great effects they can make for movie but well maybe people like this kind of movies nowadays i want more in movies not just good looking movies but good movies have to say im generally disappointed movies nowadays most of movies are just about how they look not about writing characters etc good that some does like this movie but i really dont last 30 40minutes i were just eating popcorn and thinking about my next days program 4 10 why this film is so highly rated is beyond me first of all where is the redemption the characters do nothing that can be construed as redeeming except for the one played by gil bellows they simply survive someone who also doesnt like the film compares it to a fairy tale because its unrealistic this is an insult to fairy tales fairy tales are beautiful and deep with complex motives transmitted throughout the centuries the traditional good bad dichotomy and a clear moral conclusion the shawshank redemption is dull with some basic and carefully explained symbolism because apparently were too stupid to get it otherwise and contrary to traditional notions of morality the heros sidekicks are some nice criminals of course prison staff are cast as the bad guys and their boss is portrayed as a hypocrite speaking of the bible yet acting in an un christian manner can you say anti christian bigotry the hugely overrated trivial chatting the grotesque violence the moral vacuum the deadly slowness the length  about an hour too long  make it incomprehensible today how this picture ever made people rave the way they did on this board the greatest film ever excuse me this is a feature film that says nothing depicts no authentic feelings or character development is grossly self indulgent and filled with idiotically implausible situations such as people firing powerful handguns repeatedly simultaneously and then hanging around chatting as if nobody would ever report the firing and summon the law perhaps the most implausible character of all is played by mr tarantino who shouts at the two hoodlum killers as if they were playmates from school and complains that his wife will divorce him if she returns from work to find a car in the garage containing a man with his head blown off where is the moral compass of the people who revere this schoolboy nonsense nobody in the film is remotely principled and nor is anyone except possibly the pawnbroker actually evil the scene where he releases a leather studded sadist from a cage is possibly the most unbelievable rubbish ever deployed in a hollywood feature its only entertainment i hear people protest well the difference between mr tarantino and film makers of stature is that they are capable of entertaining while instructing and of integrating the two  this movie to me pushed the envelope of wretchedness on the silver screen is it a sign of the times that it gets high ratings from the viewing public have we become that depraved or is it just a contest to see who can make the most shocking film that pulp fiction went beyond a cult following amazes me  sam peckinpah is a movie director from 1970s known for the strong dose of violence in his films dirty harry series from the same era played by clint eastwood were not deprived of a good dosage of brutality eitherso are scarface and body double of brian da palma from the 1980s in all the above however there was either a plot or a theme or at least some atmosphere with a musical score on the other hand lacking the essentials of cinematography the violence in all quentin tarantino signed stuff is so excessive and over exaggerated that it becomes simply pointless and void a young couple takes on a journey and start a spree of serial killings just for the fun of it as in natural born killers one of kidnappers approach teasingly the abducted cop and slowly slices off his ear while singing and making dance gestures as in reservoir dogs still in this one a big fat black man is being forcibly raped by an effeminate looking blond man while in the next scene a man entering the room carves up one of the captors with a sword still in another scene having been shot in the groin a man groans with pain holding to his blooded genitals now i dont see where is the fun of in all these more important where is the art in all these so that almost all qt brand films have earned such high ratings apart from the frequent humdrum dialogs such as yep  yeah  right and a lot of profanity and abusive remarks what is the idea behind that violence and sordidness have become an integral part of american society well after all that is their choice and they have to live with that but at least dont sell this crap to elsewhere if you watch historical or war films or genuine mafia mob genre by masters such as scorcese or dilaurentis or coppola blood and gore unavoidably creeps in however there is a lot more than simple violence in them unlike the vulgar and infamous qt make i might sound a bit outdated by our modern society standards but somehow i dont fancy that type of meaningless brutality and gore committed by tacky small town psychopaths in confined settings such as warehouses or obscure small shops or drab us highways this has to be the most over rated movie ever what a disappointing year first t 3 then matrix revolutions and now return of the king i guess we will never see a 3rd movie better than the first two movies the same thing happened with star wars godfather and plenty of others so its no big deal its a curse thats what it is the two towers was perfect compared to rotk oh my god how boring this movie is pj could easily have edited and cut out 1 hour of footage which is completely irrelevant only makes you yawn oh well send lots of hate mail to me now i also saw godthumb first both are eminently more watchable and enjoyable i actually do understand the characters and feel for them in both of those movies but the godfatheri just dont get why so many people say this is a great movie perhaps its to be cool and one of the crowd i was bored yes there are some powerful scenes yes the brutality was startling back then and it still works today and fits the story as opposed to the gratuitous and badly done violence in many movies yes it was also interesting to see some amazing actors at their start the story is even interesting so that i might be moved to read the book however i found the pacing too slow and the dialogue and interpersonal relationships trite and shallow im glad i finally saw this and found out it doesnt really glorify the mafia because i was not moved by anyone or empathetic with their choices im glad i finally saw it so i could say i did but i wont be watching it again i hear #2 is the bestit has to bea great film sorely let down by the ending i know jackson is only trying to stick to tolkiens version but the ending was unsuited for a film it just dragged on and on and on it really soured my experience of what otherwise was a great trilogy the interminable ending should have been resigned to a directors cut dvd version to satisfy tolkien fans the worst ending ever ai of course  so what im getting is theres this dominatrix running around with a cape funny ears and a husky scary arousing voice who also beats up guys in parking garages but none of them got aroused so the story didnt go anywhere she probably should have whipped them also there was this rich guy who it showed a lot but he didnt really have anything to do with the story it was strange but on the other hand there is that buxom green haired lady who gets beat by the dominatrix and then dresses up as a nurse id buy that for a dollar anyday i think the dominatrix probably should have got slightly naked shes got some big pecs if you know what i mean and i would have liked to find out if the carpet matched the drapes like thats the stuff i would bump into on the street by accident that gordon guy had a moustache that made me wonder but i digress there was a lot of teasing without any climactic moments of trepidating fulfillment or masochistic zeal i was appalled disappointed and finally ashamed it almost makes you wonder how director christopher nolan even thought he was making an erotic film ive felt moved to comment on this movie if only to provide some much needed balance to the string of 10 out of 10s being awarded my real rating would be about 7 10 but i cant stand seeing this up at number 4 on the top 250 list it wouldnt make my top 100 the plot was confusing and ludicrous throughout the moral dilemma of the two ferries at the end really spoilt the movie for me why werent the passengers diving off the boats and swimming for it would both boats especially one full of ex cons really have taken the morally high decision to choose death to save the others some great scenes special effects cinematography lighting dark mood etc brilliant performance by heath ledger but overall the plot let this film downno one else ive ever talked to in person about this movie has disliked it all my friends family co workers acquaintances random strangers on the street that i pass by they all loved it not liked it a lot or thoroughly enjoyed it they loved it and i couldnt stand it honestly it made me feel like a bit of an outcast so it was with great pleasure that i found that even though this movie is on the top 10 movies on imdb there are a plethora of reviews containing exactly the same qualms i had with this film i registered with imdb just so i could post this review and lower this movies rating a tiny bit +1 to all the negative sentiments in all the negative reviews of this movie it bugs me that this movie is rated so high not because its a bad movie but because its a mediocre one apparently mediocre people reward mediocre cinema this movie tanked big time when it was initially released and with good reason it wasnt until pseudo intellectuals across the country started hyping it as defacto favorite movie for lowbrows world wide that it started dominating the imdb best movie list in reality shawshank is like a sewage pump for every idiotic prison movie clichÜ© ever made every guard is a monster the warden is religious therefore evil not a single prisoner is actually guilty or if they are theyre so obviously redeemed that were supposed to feel sorry for their unfair imprisonment murderers and sex offenders sit around in beatific awe as opera plays over the loudspeakers right the whole movie is so fake so smarmy and so condescending that its no wonder that so many americans with their odd addiction to fake smarmy condescending things consider it their favorite movie i guess thinking for yourself is a burden to great for some of us to bear i had to comment i really did all those eulogies on what is in reality a hackneyed complacent pretentious film nothing that this film says challenges any principle or thought its purpose is to confirm every conservative sentimental instinct in us all and yet it has a sense of its own putative profundities and bulldozes these throughout the film really what the film is saying is neither profound nor original and is not to my mind worth saying in the first place at least not at such length ie life is hard people suffer but through struggle the human spirit will win through learn to make friends and get their deserved reward mmm nothing makes any of the characters real and the actors are not helped by this terrible overloaded narration which applies a great weight on the story which cannot breath as every moment is made to seem sooo significant it is not just that there is no lightness of touch in the direction or that there is no humour it is that there is a sense that what is being described is more important than humour or than the real nature of friendship suffice to say i loathe this film and recommend people watch it only as a lesson in what is bad about big budget hollywood moviesthis is certainly a good movie with universal themes of freedom and adversity etc etc but ive seen plenty of movies which were more artfully made than this one there is nothing revolutionary in the directing the novella by stephen king is practically tailor made for a movie adaption and it seems any capable director could have made a good movie from it i think the only reason this movie is #2 on this list is the sheer amount of people who have seen it and voted the other truly great movies near the top of the list dont pack the same mass audience appeal that shawshank redemption does nor are they shown on tnt 6 10 times a year movies like 2001 the seven samurai or lawrence of arabia for example would bore many of the people who love shawshank redemption and i personally consider those three i named and many others to be far better creations than the shawshank redemption perhaps we should take a poll of tnt viewers on the best movie of all time id bet shawshank redemption would place first with the blues brothers coming in a close secondthe only thing that amazes me about this movie is that it is not only within 500 top movies in imdb but actually #2 and soon perhaps #1 i only saw shawshank redemption once and have not been able to force myself to watch it in full length ever since it was ok to see it once even though i was almost bored then but not quite i found it very average in every respect and quite predictable i guess that this is one of those movies that is so average that it does not bother anybody by invoking powerful emotions thoughts or memories and does not have any obviously bad technical quality just sooo average hence the high scoreso my review is a bit late however it stands out none the less when i think about it certain parts of the dark knight werent horrid the batmobile was pretty sweet honestly thats all i can think of because the rest was absolute crap where shall i beginahh heath ledger come after me if you will haters but he deserves to pay even when dead his acting while entertaining was not joker joker does everything to engage in a game of chess with batman and always wants to end up the loser he portrayed the joker completely backwards im glad it was his last performance and in a way its irony he failed and the jokers spirit ended his miserable existence this dead horse has been beaten long enough so i wont go too far but batmans voice really shitty movie shittier sequelits hard to find what is wrong with a movie that seems so well crafted and put together well lets start by saying that the dark knight is very boring and messy the plot is incoherent with too many undeveloped subplots the movie tries to be realistic but logic has no place anywhere it tries to be dramatic but the drama is manufactured out of place and doesnt build up from anything lots of poor philosophical monologues going nowhere the characters have nothing nothing interesting about them theyre like puppets used to create some sort of politicised view of the world where everyone is miserable with no sense of humor taking no pleasure from their actions whatever they are and creating this dull vision of the world hidden behind a comic superhero is what this movie is all about all the rest comes as a consequence of this anything that happens has little or no effect batman is just as hollow as every one else you could swap him with some other character and nothing would change action is just average random things happening out of nowhere and no explanations is given on how they managed to do that some great effects here and there dont add much to the movie i like violent movies but the violence in the dk is pretty much senseless as well as censored definitely not for young kids the movie is not dark is hollow if you want a good dark movie then go to see the awesome the crow you want to see a good batman movie then watch the tim burtons version flat with no substance humor or soul the dark knight doesnt leave you with any emotions whatsoever no hope and not even hopelessness only a lame sense of depressioni sat through this movie yesterday the special effects and the visuals were great as in the previous two parts they are pretty much what you would expect after reading the books which i did a long time ago ok so everything looks nice but otherwise the movies had little to offer i do not want to bash the movies too much because they made such a good effort in illustrating the books so this will be brief some of the problems were that the characters are very thin the dialogue is terrible and the music mediocre at best the movies also have this tendency of just marching through the obligatory plot events at a rapid pace therefore while sitting through the movies i noticed i really did not care what happens to these creatures we are for example supposed to like the good guys because they are so beautiful handsome as opposed to the ugly bad guys and because we are told they are great but there is hardly any screen time for them to demonstrate any of these good characteristics as persons except for their nice manners compared with those of the bad guys i guess a 300 hour tv series might have been a much better format to fully present the material as long as they would fix the dialogue and the music but that would have been impossible ok lookthis movie doesnt deserve one star but it definitely doesnt deserve 10 or even 9 or 8 the only reason i gave this a one star is to even out for all the lemmings that gave it 10 in my humble opinion this movie could fall in the 7 8 range and i would tend to say ok that sounds about right at what point is this movie the masterpiece that deserves 10 stars what makes this movie so innovative and groundbreaking that someone could give it a perfect score just because someone leaves a theater saying wow that movie kicked ass it doesnt mean that it is in the same category with movies like the godfather  star wars  casablanca and other movies that rewrite the beliefs of what great movies are i wouldnt even say that the dark knight is the best movie in the batman franchise much less one of the greatest movies of all time its not even the best batman with the same characters go back and watch batman with michael keaton and jack nickelson and tell me with a straight face that the dark knight is better film and i will be content to know that the world is doomed having said all this the dark knight was watchable and i did enjoy heath ledgers rip role as the joker it is a shame christian bales poor batman character had to spoil it this movie was 1 way too long 2 way way too long 3 tried to do too much 4 made me believe that jake gyllenhall is a more believable love interest than his sister sorry shes just very plain looking and a mediocre actress at best 5 lost the dialog in an overwhelming music score 6 had a horrible script 7 ledger is the best thing about the film but no one could live up to the hype sadly he will not be able to reprise this role 8 put every good scene in the trailers and fooled everyone by doing so 9the people who made this knew it is a stinker and sold it hard on the net 10 had an over and over and over feel to it i started looking at my watch about 45 minutes into the movie and about every 10 minutes thereafter i thought it would never end and then the ending was blah i have read stuff here about maggie gyllenhall being a better actress that katie holmes well she may be but katie holmes was much more believable than she was in the role she was unwatchable she ruined the movie for me because no one could believe that she was being fought over by two handsome men i almost puked when the joker says hello beautiful and some one in the theater actually called out shes a beast the first movie was great this one just really disappointing go see it i wont have such high expectations again the honest vote should be a 5 but i lowered it to account for the deluded and blind i was born in 1984 thus when pulp fiction came outmy parents did not want me to watch itmy mom thought it was stupidin my junior year of high school i joined a dvd club and bought the movie with no prior viewingone of the dates ill never forget in my possession is the pulp fiction dvd the pulp fiction script which i opted not to steal a pulp fiction shirt a pulp fiction advertising down sized poster the american poster and the french cannes festival i have even flown to europe just to walk into a mcdonalds in france to see if the royale with cheese thing was true i soon found out with multiple pictures of the menu a physical copy of the menu hamburger wrapping with royal cheese on them and a receipt with my purchase of the royal cheese the virgin record store inside the louvre had the french poster i never realized after recollecting my purchases the strong impact this movie has made on me and the realization that it is quite possibly the greatest film of all time and only my obsession with mafia movies is the only thing keeping me from full blown ecstatic fanatic i cant believe the dialogue the portrayals the camera angles the whole plot how one man can dissolve this beautfied violence into existence overwhelms me its whole profound existence makes me proud just to be american how one movie can just hit every button on the perfection control panel is beyond comprehension god bless youquentin tarantino totally sickening no redeeming value to the human condition why not study the uplifting people in the world instead of getting a view through the eyes of the most degenerate disgusting and completely perverted few the more glimpses they show into the lives of the debase people of the world the more debase our world becomesit sucked big time spoiler at least one of the midgets should have died nothing worthy of a message in thinking that luck will get you to your goals and other people will have to pay for your incompetence the movie is excruciating and super long most overrated franchise of all time why does any character has to cry that much on a non drama flick i miss rudy playing semi tough roles i cant believe the so called weighted average allows all the fat misfits to place every geeky franchise of films inside the top 250 its pretty frustrating and disappointing any movie that has any association with comic con should automatically receive 2 or 3 full points decrease out of the score i think thats it dont watch this movie or anything from the franchise and specifically get away of the lord of the rings prequels that are even slower with half the battles and boring this movie was a big old pile of suck and more suck soooooooooo boring gahahahahhahahaha that was the sound of my brain committing harakiri over the lameness of this lame movie here are the oscars this film should have been nominated for worst picture biggest pile of suck worst performance ever the hurp a durp memorial award for suck the why god why prize we would have been better off if the earth had never been created than live in a world where this exists suck this is for all the guys who voted to make this movie a masterpiece i dont know on what everyone depended in evaluating this movie everyone agrees that the cast includes some of the best actors out there but a good cast doesnt mean that the movie is a masterpiece this movie was without a subject no message too much repeated sentences nothing connected with each other you will get tired of listening to duologues about foot massage  hamburgers  butchs fathers watch äó_etc these things cover more than a half of the movies length without meaning anything to the movie i was very disappointed when i saw this movie this movie is way overrated and should be among imbd 100 bottom if you want to waste two and a half hours listening only to duologues without a subject then this is the movie and if you really want to know how a masterpiece looks like then you should watch the shawshank redemption review of one of the most surprising let downs follows there are no spoilers the film spoils itself enough its fair to say that prior to this film coming out i had concerns over the use of the joker in this film concerns that only got more pronounced when id heard they cast health ledger in the role then i saw brokeback mountain and i became convinced that actually the guy had a raw talent and that maybe just maybe he could pull it off until the trailer came out and i was immediately concerned again so how was heath neither good nor bad he was a live wire and gleefully unpredictable and a shambolic almost serpentine presence at points but it wasnt spectacular talks of post humous oscar nods though are an exceptional exaggeration and unfortunately i believe this to be motivated by grief for ledger aaron ekharts not bad but im not really sure anyone knew why he was really there i did not believe in harvey dent maggie gyllenhaal was awful it is a terrifying thing to say that katie holmes was better you actually have your fingers crossed that someone will kill her right from the start morgan freeman has a couple of nice moments but despite being given more screen time he contributes very little same with gary oldman seriously what happened even christian bale seems to have lost a sense of what hes doing batmans voice getting ever closer to sounding like rod stewarts singing voice that at times i couldnt take it seriously assuming you can make out what hes saying at all its difficult to comprehend that the same cast is in this film and batman begins they really dont stack up side by side at all everone feels wasted the dark knight is over long it takes forever to really get any momentum going and then at the point you think its starting it fails to launch there are set pieces that dont really hang together and if you think about any of them for too long which you will as it does tend to drag youll find that they dont all make sense one of the things that made batman begins so strong was a sense of realism even going to great lengths to try to rationalize the ridiculous a man dressed as a bat tragically the dark knight seems to have forgotten this entirely yes the joker is larger than life but does that explain the obviously cgi enhanced stupid moments such as the bat pod cycling up a wall to flip over there are too many of these moments turning every cell phone into a sonar transponder in order to trace the joker um what also everyone felt very written everyones dialogue seemed to be furthering the plot rather than sounding like anything approaching reality michael cain turns into aunt may giving twee and convenient platitudes and nothing else theres no sense of connection between him and anyone else gyllenhaal even managing to leave twee and convenient letters to be read at twee and convenient moments aaron ekhart seems to basically behave like a character bio rather than feeling terribly real and the whole descent into two face thing still doesnt work if you loved batman begins and i did you wont love this im afraid you may not hate it but i dont think youll be impressed i hope to watch this again at some point when the let down has passed me by and ill hopefully enjoy it a bit more there are three recent films ive been to see i had low expectations for iron man the incredible hulk and the dark knight the first two surprised me and exceeded my expectations the latter has left me feeling a bit flat im just very disappointed batman begins set a very high mark the dark knight by comparison is almost worth avoidingim a modern type of movie viewer but i can appreciate classics like annie hall  midnight cowboy  forrest gump  casablanca etc i simply do not understand what people see in the godfather to start with im not really into the whole crime mob italian sicilian naples mafiosi family thing so it didnt have my attention at that the acting was good but marlon brando was annoying his weirdy voice is infamous but i couldnt understand anything he said it sounded very flaccid and emotionless too the story itself seemed very pointless michael corleone kills a bunch of people mob hits his father gets shot or something he becomes the new godfather or something nothing had shown itself much changed or resolved didnt serve a purpose other than to show a bunch of cursing and killing with thick accents the mood was also very very cold hearted theres a general complaint about steven spielbergs munich that its very cold too that the characters dont have a warmth to them that you can identify with the godfather characters are like this too you cant identify with any of the characters because they seem so heartless and cold not even with a hint of charm to them to make you like them except maybe marlon brando who seemed like a crazy old grandpa whos half senile i cant see the classic status of this movie if it were released today would it receive the same praise i liked this film and all but does anyone really think this film is better than lord of the rings come on its surprising how many people supposedly love this film yet can only put up the defense that it was well acted a few mumblings here and there do not good acting make and the attention to detail argument its so detailed exactly as that era so what lord of the rings brought to life a fantasy land far more challenging than 1940s new york when i was in high school i took a cinema class and the teacher showed the godfather i & ii i personally thought the movie was way too long and way too boring there was just nothing entertaining about this movie not to me any way if you like to watch movies about the mafia then this is the movie for you i dont mind seeing a movie about the mafia and gangs if it is entertaining when i was forced to watch the godfather i & ii in my cinema class i wish i had a pillow to put on my desk so that i could sleep if you every have trouble getting to sleep at night just put the godfather on and you will be asleep in no timei went to see dark knight because of heath ledger only batman begins sucked chris nolan sucks batman begins made no sense at allfor people with brains that is spoiler first chris nolans direction was nauseating there were too many camera movements during some action scenes where they could have been better without second nolan under used the best villain in the moviescarecrow and mis casted the other oneras al ghul watanabe should have remained and liam neeson should have been out third during bruce waynes training on top of the mountain he was asked to execute a perp he refused than started a brawl with the clan burned down the monastery killed most of the clan including the perp that he refused to kill in the first place and saved the life of the one person that he should have let dieno common sense at all spoiler i had hoped that dark knight would be better with less camera movementsdidnt happen there were cameras rotating in circles around people just standing stillvery annoying and un professional its bad for people with remthats rapid eye movements and ear infections nolan did used his villains well in the dark knight the non traditional joker was maniacal in a good way two face was well used he did a great job even rachel dawes was wonderful spoiler the bad part about this movie was the batman himself if all these people who commented on this movie actually saw the same movie that i saw they should also note that batman did absolutely nothing in this movie there was nothing dark and nothing knight about batman all he did was abused and brutalized the joker inside a police interrogating room no lessamazing when the joker was already dazed and drained there was a couple of minutes of fist fighting with the joker on top of a balcony but nothing confrontational or face two faceha i made a funnyspoiler there was a ridiculous scene where a couple of citizens dressed as batman doing their own vigilante things using automatic weapons and costumes that looked like batmanshow where did they get those copied costumes fighting a hooded scarecrow i thinknolan left us with no details if it was the real scarecrow im sure he would have used his fear agents spoiler the writing was bad for bruce wayne as well he had a few tacky lines that made him look more stupid and repulsive instead of pretend clumsiness from tim burtons batman if you have a brain inside your skull save your money for the dvd at least you will get more extras for your money ignore those fanatic nerds who believes that dark knight is a great movie watch it for heath ledger only on dvd i love batman in fact i loved batman begins as much as i did the 1989 micheal keaton one but this one i believe has sold out it was obvious theyre trying to tap into the saw audience by making the joker some kind of ultra realistic disgusting serial killer nicholsons performance was so superior its not even funny the heath ledger joker had no class whatsoever and was a completely unbelievable bullshit philosopher through out why did he have a knife where was the long ass gun jokers always supposed to have very saw like games that he played on the masses were a disappointment the problem is also that the movie tries desperately to tie in ultra gritty realism and philosophical justifications its a comic book for gods sake don t try so hard to make it realistic it was created with a lot of skill but just took the wrong turn from what i was hoping for all the situations where just contrived reincarnations of other scenes weve seen in other recent blockbusters the hostage scenes 16 blocks inside man other stupid cop movies the played out you have to chose the girl or some other chump just like in the spider man movie bat man begins was steady and a very creative new take on the comic they should of focused the originality instead of making an overly dramatic pile of feces and two face one of my favorite villains seemed like they just pulled that one out of their ass and made him into a totally unpredictable dick that got added on towards the end of the movie and then killed off without ever doing anything remotely cool the cell phone sonar thing was inane so much potential wasted truthfully its not a 1 either but i feel compelled to balance out all the people who are giving it a 10 if i were able to give it an honest rating it would probably be a 5 out of 10 which is still pretty awful but well deserved this film is a pathetic sequel to a promising re invention of the batman franchise batman begins i have huge respect for christopher nolan mostly for memento which has an honest rating of 86 on imdb and justifiably ranks in the top 250 greatest films i make the distinction because i dont think the dark knight is being rated honestly the current rating of 94 is so obviously a sympathy vote for heath ledger who does a fantastic job that imdb should disqualify the rating as tainted i wont give anything away because theres truthfully not much to give away in the first place the story line is as schizophrenic and chaotic as the joker himself the internal logic of the film is all over the map and leads to a very unsatisfying conclusion if the result was an art film then a disjointed story might be forgivable but thats not the case this is a pedantic boring formulaic summer blockbuster film masquerading as a piece of art as i said heath ledgers joker is a great characterization even if it does draw noticeably on nicholsons portrayal ledger is undeniably fun to watch which is more than i can say for christian bale bale is a passable bruce wayne but in this film hes an extremely dull batman and whats with his voice was that his idea or nolans direction if youre going to utter dialogue sounding as if youve just gargled battery acid it can be effective only as a brief energetic exclamation preferably monosyllabic however if you try to speak for 5 minutes in this manner it becomes not only distracting but comical any time batman distressed his vocal cords for more than 10 seconds spontaneous laughter broke out all over the packed theater im sure this is not the response that nolan envisioned for these parts of the film to sum it all up seeing this film would be a complete waste of time if it wasnt for heath ledger wait for it to come out on video if you want to see a really good comic adaptation then go see ironman even fantastic 4 which was a big disappointment to me was a better comic adaptation than the dark knight first let me say that this movie does not deserve only one star my real rating would be a six to an eight depending on your taste in movies but i had to compensate compensate for what well literary device im glad you asked toolsäó_the answer is tools no not instruments used to construct objects or to do maintenance work around the house such as a hammer or screw driver im talking about people people who are easily swayed by other peoples opinions and by mass marketing campaigns unfortunately almost everyone in america including myself is subject to tooldom from time to time so we can really only judge others based on the extent and frequency to which a person is a tool now i realize that these tools sound pretty scary so here is a trick you can use to spot and avoid the biggest of these flaming idiots if they have ever given the dark knight 10 10 stars or referred to it as one of the greatest movies of all time well then lil miss daisy im afraid you have a huge tool on your hands i recommend immediate euthanasia why this movie is not up to par is covered thoroughly in other negative reviews i simply felt the need to explain why there are so many overwhelmingly positive reviews its quite simple really the media told everyone they should likeäó_so they did these people then went out and told their friends that they should like itäó_so they did and these friends then went out and told other friends that they should like itäó_so they did so it went until one day tdk topped the list of imdbs greatest movies of all time what it boils down to is that this is your basic super hero movie that got really good media coverage had the initial media coverage been negative and heath ledger god rest his soul not died at an unfortunately opportunistic time for hollywood this never would of happened basically what im saying is someone told you this movie was good so you went into it with a positive attitude and were willing to ignore some of the flaws and while the revelation that going into something with a positive attitude will make the experience better for you might not surprise you or anyone else on the planet i feel that the warm fuzzy feeling towards this movie has gotten to a point of excess too many people told you it was good you went into it with too positive an attitude and you ignored too many of the flaws this movies current average 9 10 is absurd and a perfect example of why all my scathing comments about tools in the previous paragraph are justified its an ok movie and a good movie if you like action movies and are willing to ignore glaring plot holes like the villain spitting in the face of physics and being able to do or be anything anywhere at any time he wanted i saw this movie on a monday afternoon in hopes of avoiding a long wait and big crowds at the theater good plan it worked the movie didnt many reviewers have already commented on the gross mediocrity of this film so ill skip that part there were some very good though isolated moments in the story a lesson about how torture is wrong and doesnt work the equal value of all lives regardless of how they have been lived abridged civil rights are neither civil nor right etc i like all those concepts and they are certainly worthy of exploration given our current political state to me however the most prominent feature of this film was neither heath ledger whom i greatly respect as an actor christian bale nor the script directing story line performances or suspense but rather the gorrific violence that punctuated almost every moment of the more than two and a half hours this thing went on everything in this movie explodes and the cut aways in the editing do nothing to mitigate the impact of all the slashing stabbing pounding bludgeoning shooting and impaling that becomes ridiculous about halfway through and though i have enormous respect for him ledgers joker was basically ted bundy with face paint i think the inspiration for this film came more from oliver stones natuarl born killers than from anything that was ever written in a comic book all you need to know is this in the last ten minutes of the film with the body count hovering somewhere around 100 a scene begins to unfold where a young child is about to be murdered in cold blood those of you who have seen the movie know what im talking about the scene goes on for what i thought was an excruciatingly long time but even as it was just beginning i was thinking to myself no no no this is wrong this should not be done this way in a movie then somewhere in the theater behind me a child began sobbing uncontrollably yes real terror real horror real fear a real child right there in the theater the scene finally came to an end the sobbing didnt as the lights came up for us to leave i saw a couple escorting their approximately 12 year old son out of the theater still sobbing and hanging on to his parents clothing as they walked out i dont blame the parents this movies pg13 rating is unconscionable this is a batman movie with a pg13 rating batman originated from a childrens comic book series one would think that this movie would be a safe experience for children its not given the grotesque thread of constant violence that runs from the opening credits to the closing credits its not even suitable for adults several of the postings here at imdb with the lowest ratings have noted that they are putting their rating as low as possible to balance out the overly generous perfect scores that have vaulted this movie into the position of being one of the greatest film everaccording to imdb not me i really didnt like this movie and in the last ten minutes of it i came to hate it it does not do service to the batman franchise or movies in general there is not a shred of comic book appeal in it anywhere and it will take its place as one of the most uselessly violent movies ever made that this offering has the broad appeal it has makes me a little sad and sick inside and if i could speak for the poor kid that was sitting behind me during this bloated gore fest id say this thanks for the memories i must admit that this movie should receive the trophy of anthem of a generation for incredible bad movies of the new era of film making first time ive heard of this movie was from a friend who told me and i quote man this movie is on the top of imdb list we have to see it so i did see it i was expecting something great but after one hour i was sick of it and left the room it is non stop action with no script nothing at allall you see and hear in this movie is bum bumbang bang and not even some clichÜ© lines nothing artistic the only plots in this movie are kinder garden plots and they are tied in an anarchic structurethe only reason to look at this movie is to see special effects and cgibatman begins is a much better movie than this one christian bales performance was less than mediocre even if everyone praised him for reinventing the character of batmanit brings nothing new the batman concept the only actor who did something was heath ledger joker you would probably ask why is rated so highthe answer is that the marketing and the propaganda did a great job infusing in people minds the idea that this is a good movie plus the rating of a movie it is mostly subjective and when you say that a movie costs $180 million and it has all of this presumed great actors people will say gee that is a great movie and the critics do you think that they are honorable people who rate movies with objectivity for the good of the people of course not they have to sell the newspapers they work forand once i asked an american friend why do you listen to a popular band at that time and he said because it is what is cool now and what people listen i dont agree with him so when you rate a movie listen to your inner self not others ill give the dark knight 1 out of 10 stars just so that its rating on the website will go down because it doesnt deserve to be anywhere on the top 250 list its incredible that heath ledgers acting carried the entire movie on its feet while the rest of the cast tries to entertain us with mediocre acting plain action scenes bad screen writing and the worst batman of all the movies christian bail with all his terrible speech impediments i wouldnt think twice to consider this a film the original tim burton version is a film its sequel is a film but christopher nolan puts a horrid scratch in the line of movies the dark knight with its mediocre plot character development story acting exception of course for heath ledger just makes for a not so epic movie only worthy of a 6 out of 10 rating the dark knight sucks you dont understand film if you think this mess is an exceptional piece of cinema and i hope that daniel day lewis will turn down the joker roll for the next movie theyre getting the best actor possible to play the joker hoping that hell do the same as heath did score 500 million in the box office rip heathtoo much hype to take this film serious people were crazy about this film even before it released talk of an oscar for heath ledger before this film hit theaters will respect to heaths death but i think his death gave this film a bigger boost and expectation once the film came out i didnt find it that much different than any other action film it was just one explosion after another the performances were strong by everyone except for maggie gyllenhaal though better than katie holms performance doesnt mean it was a good one there was something that bothered me about christian bales voice when he was batman as bruce wayne it was normal but when he was batman it was a complete change to a lower aggressive voice that didnt even sound like bales voice at all it sounded bad then there is heath ledger it was not a bad performance at all in fact it was rather great at times he took the joker character to an all time low and gave it a more sadistic gruesome feel but to discredit what jack nicholson did for the character 19 years ago is not right jack gave heath a blue print on how to play the character and heath took it to another level i really dont think its oscar worthy like everyone is preaching for but it is a fine job by ledger i really dont understand why fans are treating this like the second coming of christ or something calling it the best film ever a masterpiece the greatest super hero movie ever it should knock titanic of the top of the box office cause its a better movie its all a little premature if you ask me if degrading other movies or other actors to make this film look good is people best review of the dark knight then they are pretty closed minded the dark knight is a damn good action film nothing more nothing lessthere were just too many subplots too much violence and it was at least a half hour too long they should have taken some of the time they spent planning cgi effects and used it to seal some of the plot holes 1 a witness pulls a gun out while hes on the witness stand excuse me this is some mythic land where the courthouses dont have metal detectors 2 theres a terrorist threat against a hospital so they evacuate every patient except the one whos been in all the papers 3 the police are transporting a high profile prisoner with dozens of vehicles escorting him and swat teams all over the place but one trailer truck starts chasing them and theyre all helpless 4 the silliest thing of all batmans constant whispering its supposed to make him sound menacing but he just sounds like he has laryngitis its like the old superman tv show where people magically have no idea who he is as long as he keeps his glasses on i know im way in the minority on this one but i have to say this was the ugliest stupidest movie ive ever seen i would have walked out if i werent trapped at the end of an aisle you couldnt pay me enough to sit through it againok batman tdk is a good thriller worthing maybe a 7 out of 10 but is simply not conceivable that it is ranked more than masterpieces like the godfather and other wonderful pieces of art batman tdk is not a piece of art is just entertainment good entertainment even if the movie is a bit long the plot confused and sometimes non sense what about the logic of the ending mobile phone image scanningetc etc as other reviewers already commented the batman character voice is also pathetic with the forced laryngitis like tone do you want batman to talk like a 140 kg wrestling player nah those things may perhaps have impact on kids but look ridiculous to any other more mature audience heath ledgers performance is good in my opinion the best thing in this movie i liked his performance when the joker is coming out from the hospital before the explosion when he walked in a very strange psychotic way dressed like a nurse ahaha i liked his mimic i put 1 10 on this movie knowing that it deserves probably a 7 10 to reduce this insane over ratinghow could this movie possibly have received so much acclaim ok its competently executed both in terms of acting and production values but then with the money spent on it hopefully that should be taken for granted and certainly it has some fine actors in it and they give every impression of fully believing in their work but what the heck is the point of it supposed to be im sorry but i just absolutely hated it it reminds me of a local case in the press here in toronto a while ago where some art student made a movie of a cat being tortured to death since he actually tortured a cat to death to make it he was charged and prosecuted and his defence was that it was art well at least all the people tortured and killed in this movie presumably were only faking it and werent actually hurt but i still dont think it has any more claim to be worthwhile or to be art its obnoxious rubbish and i strongly suggest that if you havent seen it and are considering doing so you think of some better use for your time which would be pretty much anything not actually harmful to your health or anybody elsesthe red coats are coming the red coats are coming once again the english is trying to invade the land of the free imdb i apologize for not believing those who warned me of this movie people actually walked out i very much wanted to however i was with a friend he apparently wanted out as well being respectful of each other did not say anything till we discussed the movie which took about 2 seconds movie is hollow there is no beginning and most important there is no end batmans voice was annoying heath was okay especially with his disappearing trick oh yes one person clapped at the end i wanted to jump down and beat the hell out of him then realized he was slapping his head for it went numb for those who dont believe the negative ratings i want you to go watch itledger gives a powerful performance as the joker but the rest of the movie was a bit out of focus surprisingly the movie revolves around harvey dent the white knight unfortunately eckhart was bland as harvey dent and his fall to the dark side was almost corny shame really as this was harvey dents story rather than batmans speaking of which i have never seen christian bale act this poorly the man is one of the greatest actors of his generation and now his performance was totally uninspired the batman voice is incredibly distracting and as bruce wayne he just sleepwalks through his scenes i also noticed that he wasnt as buff as he was in begins in all honesty there wasnt much for him to do here though the script simply doesnt give batman much to do other than fight and beat up people bruce wayne is the billionaire playboy and thats about it freeman and cain virtually play the same character they do it well but the cast is too bloated already so they dont get much screen time maggie gyllenhaal was great she was able to bring warmth to her portrayal of rachel dawes but unfortunately we dont get to see much of her either the philosophical themes in this movie are barely explored every hero turns into a villain or some such nonsense every firefighter will turn evil unless they die very shallow and laughable only jokers nihilistic speeches were convincing every good hearted person either dies or gets horribly mutilated and then turns to evil batman beats prisoners and brakes peoples legs why so violent then you have your boring action sequences the mandatory car chases and numerous explosions the dark knight is actually an action movie much like die hard only the nihilistic philosophy sets it apart and gives it a unique flavor if you are a big action movie fan youll probably enjoy this movie the dark knight isnt as good as batman begins batman begins was a character study how a traumatized young boy became a hero and how he turned his anger and fear into something positive here we see the hero corrupted by joker he is violent and angry no longer a hero he is willing to lie to the people of gotham because they couldnt handle the truth this sends a dubious message in fact this movie has way more propaganda than your average summer blockbuster invading privacy torturing prisoners and lying to the public but its cool cause its batman kids wanna be like batman and therefore batman is cool even while torturing prisoners dark knight could be viewed as legitimizing dick cheneys war on terror its pretty disgusting we have to work the dark side mr cheney said after 911 batman agrees i gave this film a one just to pull down the overall score of the film it doesnt deserve the 10th place on top 250 list there is no way that this film deserves ten points heath ledger was great in his role as a joker no doubt about that his early departure from the land of the living makes his role stand out in many peoples minds and give a extra glitter to whole movie without joker this film would have much less ten point votes story really was bloated with too many characters most of them just showing their face in the movie without any significance to the main storyline scarecrow and batman boys or what they were called were totally unnecessary bypassers in the first half of the movie story was all over the place and it didnt have the consistency or the red line that it could follow many scenes were just boring and ridiculous this film really didnt give nothing good to the whole batman sagahow anyone can rate any one of these movies very high is perplexing this is like fodder for the middle american masses lengthy boring scenes of mediocre effects and dumb costumes the monkey suit takes the cake and sums up the whole mess terrible acting wow they found someone who is actually worse than harrison ford lucas using joesph cambell to lend credibility to this crap was a sin i wonder how much money was spent on joe to get him on the sw wagon ok so it is a harmless movie and some people apparently like it but come on better than american beauty or being john malkevich or spirits of the dead or any monty python movie etc etc etc oh well enjoy it first the good things this people who made this movie really tried and put effort into what they were doing they get an a for effort maybe they tried too hard the good things about this movie come from the book the story the inspiration every good line every good scene what the movie brings to this story is not good it manages to make each chapter into a long drawn out mess its tiring to watch a super close up of some heroic figure speak a overly dramatic line delivered in some pseudo shakespearean delivery again and again watching elijah wood furrow his eyebrows for 2 hours almost drove me insane aragorn and his accent were to avoid exaggeration pretty annoying thanks to liv tyler for some super uninteresting words whatever they were something about love and forever yada yada yada that being said boromir and a few others had some memorable lines what passes for action is hyperbolic cgi silly costumes i loved seeing goblins prance around like broadway dancers and kung fu blockbuster style action scenes if you have scene any movie with swords and or fighting in it then youve seen this before if you like mtv video games or crack you will like this movie it is a triumph of using good books as an ingredient in the big movie formula you can rent this and spiderman 2 all in the same day then go download some britney spears pictures all entertaining for about 5 minutes if you are over 16 or you are looking for something interesting or new pass this by i cant talk about the thousands or more positive aspects of this film when so many people are so overly optimistic about it and completely blind to its sometimes unacceptable flaws when i saw it i wanted to spit at the moviescreen its a truly great movie but there are so many stupid unnecessary faults and flaws preventing it from being perfect that you just gotta hate it doesnt people see the excessive use of cgi graphics making this film look like final fantasy dont you see that what you just think it looks cool wow look what they can do those special effects guys dont you realize no one will be impressed by the effex of this movie in 20 years those of you who havent read the books how can you like this at all as just a movie cuz it isnt even a movie its a really detailed animated synopsis of the books the three of them that is and not really accurate at that ever wondered where the drama went the depths of any scene or character the direction and exhibition if i can use that word of the parallel story lines or are you just revelling in the roller coaster ride feel to the film the cool effects weaponry and armour digital creatures the battle scenes and the heroic speeches with the typical romantic gaze of the eyes looking out over the horizon i actually usually enjoy the latter things but its just too much here and not good enough this really is true porn for the mid teenage rpg junkie and immature and nerdy men are you really that superficial cant you smell the melted plastic sure this truly is a gourmÜ© dish all the more reason not to have any funny odeurs interfering with it this review wont be helpful to most of you of course cuz yall are probably like everybody else i just needed to spread my word get it off my chest peter jackson deserves all the respect he can get and the actors are really great and perfect for their roles but dont over do it this trilogy film is not the best movie ever made not a chance princess mononoke and spirited away each carry more depth than all three parts of lotr together its magnificent and overwhelming but not brilliant a film of this magnitude shoulnt leave anyone unsatisfied but it did at least with me cuz it didnt live up to its potential and it wasnt even better the the prior part so of course i was mad at it how couldnt i be how couldnt you be its like youre fanatical muslims or christians and this is the holy bible or coran you cant even question it or criticize it wake up this movie sucks really hard how it beat lost in translation i will never know 11 oscars really even best song huh is that right acting good nah sean austin deserved the best supporting really cant be no oh good people are blinded by its bland cg effect ok gollum looked great but the battle scenes weak take off the blindfold and realize that it is not good i am sad that this movie is second highest grossing of all time yeah i know what your thinking i saw it and i saw the other two the fellowship of the ring was good but the this and the two towers stunk really bad naughty peter jackson naughty go sit in the cornerthis is in my opinion the most over rated film of all time sure there is some snappy dialogue here and there and tarantino has a good ear for music but none of this warrants the gushing praise heaped upon this movie nor the godlike status bestowed upon tarantino himself its over stylised over loud over acted sorry samuel tim john uma & bruce and the non linear narrative so favoured by the director simply doesnt work but its fashionable so its popular by the way this is one of the few films where ive actually seen people get up and walk out of the cinema before the end so i guess im not the only one who didnt like itso many high expectations which are all brought plummeting downward in the final episode of the saga first of all orlando bloom is gay he is one of the most pathetic actors i have ever watched secondly this movie is incredibly long and drawn out with nothing any more interesting then what is in the two towers finally it is very disappointing watching the poor acting coming from elijah wood and sean astin they have done better in movie such as north and encino man fortunately for the avid moviegoers there are some quality fantasy scifi movies that you can go see such as manos hands of fate and mortal kombat annihalation the only good thing about this movie iswait there are no good parts about this movie take this review serious because i am serious if you want to call me and talk to me about it call 1 805 423 6182 ask for chris or alexit will put you asleep because of how slow it moves now its not that i don not like 3 hours+ long movies i mean my favorite movie is once upon a time in america its just that lord of the ring the return of the king breaks the record for slowest moving movie half of the movie is just frodo and his friend sam trying to find some type of volcano to throw the ring and destroy it before gollum can get a hand on it the other half is just this big huge battle being fought now you expect a battle to give be action packed and give you an adrenaline rush but this movie does the complete opposite because of how slow it moves and how lame the few battles that are fought end it is a complete waist of time and you should only watch this movie if you have trouble sleeping at night because it will put you to sleep after the first few scenes i am still ashamed of the academy for giving this movie 11 oscars and i am still wondering how it did not win any razzie awards i didnt grow up in the 70s and i understand that every movie belongs to its generation after watching this movie although i cant say i didnt enjoy it i am far from considering it best movie ever and certainly it is absolutely preposterous to make it #1 here first of all this movie is not for everyone it contains subject matter and scenes suitable for rather limited specific audiences second although glorification of crime in recent years especially by rap artists became a trend i dont think that values of this movie is exactly politically correct äóñ making this movie `best of all times is equivalent to canonizing john gotti äóñ ridiculous third as mentioned above this movie is just too vintage it is not how some people here imply  immortal  it is rather thematic and i would say monotone to the era it was made in i shall not further burden you with reasons although i have plenty of them contact me if you want to discuss this subject in detail nevertheless i will give it a rating of 1 10 because i think it is unfair to the other much greater works for this movie to be at this place this movie continues to be praised but when i rented it i only made it through 45 minutes before i stopped the video there arent many movies that are so bad i dont watch the whole thing but the godfather is that bad i dont care how much other people may like it i still say it suckssuckssuckssuckssuckssuckssucks blood and violence does not make up for horrible acting bad plot and ridiculous slap stick comedy it amazes me that so many brain dead americans found this movie enlightening i can not see why i originally saw pulp fiction in the theater and was thrown a back not because i was moved by its greatness but because i vomited all over the theater i recently gave it another shot and ended up vomiting all over my family room if any of you want to see a good movie that has great violence and great acting plot check out se7en or fight club or the boondock saints or the way of the gun i suggest to all stay away from quentin torrentino and check out movies written directed by david fincher or christopher mcquarrie they are two of the best movie makers that have appeared in the last 20 years torrentino is a hack who steals all his ideas from indy low budget 1970s films mostly crappy asian films and makes millions of dollars pawning his regurgitated crap back to his loyal if not brain dead fan base the lord of the rings the return of the king the review how is it that such worthless eyecandy with one traited characters and a predictable storyline make it into the top 250 has every female under 18 given it a ten its disgusting the dialogue is pure crap much of every question asked in the whole series is usually answered by listen to your heart  is frodo alive  listen to your heart  should i marry aragorn even though hes mortal  listen to your heart the movies special effects are good though the battle scenes leave no suspense and are only fun to watch i truely didnt care for any of the characters aragorn as a brave noble warrior blah gimli as the comic relief wtf legolas as the cute archer yuck gandalf as the wise wizard dear god saramon as the greedy evil wizard pfft frodo as the innocent caring victim originality people etc who cares what bugs me the most is that this overrated garbage is actually in the top ten of the top 250 in front of pulp fiction citizen kane casablanca seven samaraui forgive my spelling 2001 a space oddesseythe list goes on its sickening summary the lotr the return of the king is overrated nothing more then eyecandy overall grade 1 10 40 pulp fiction panders to base behaviorthe filth of the languagesubject matterincluding sodomysickening drug use & the flippancy of the hit men is not amusingthis movie is one of the worst pieces of trash ever pawned off as artglorification of this movie illuminates the level of moral turpitude that permeates throughout american society & hollywood in particularit was good for its time yeah sure but do you really still think it deserves #1 of all time i just think there are better films out there ones with more action suspensespecial effects i know it was low budgetactors etc there just seemed to be more dialogue than anything else in the film put together if you showed this to the younger generation then they would simply not be impressed there are bigger titles out now and why is everyone still voting this in it would be much better to vote the lord of the rings trilogy in the top 3 or put the shaw shank redemption at #1 that would make more sense i would personally put the godfather at #5 seeing as it does have the best title for a film of all time i did what many listed here have done and rented it against my better judgement since the previews had done little to entice me as objective as an analysis goes heres my 002$ positives 1 the movie is original 2 the way the multiple stories intersect is probably the high point 3 it contains seasoned actors that perform the role as well as can be expected 4 i did smile during the door shooting scene with travolta & jackson and few others humours one liners conversations negatives i there is way too much foul language is it possible to let the clock tick with hearing an f word i can even commend times it should be used to underline emphasize etc but every 45 seconds ii individually some stories might have become interesting but by just skimming on the better ones bruce willis and digging deeper in the blander ones travoltasand the dude bagged in the car = you come away with a yeah so what lingering in your mind iii a few original lines and skewed timeline doesnt a movie make one has the sense of a hyped up boxing match where the champ get cut in the 1st minute of the 1st round thus ruled a no contest i can see it appealing to some mtv type crowd or some that desperately cr ave something original which it is but gives me nothing to digest once over vs something one can really connect and sink his teeth into like the shawshank redemption gattaca american beauty that one is a rose by any other name and it certainly doesnt deserve to be in the top100 of all times enjoy the show folks jerome m one reviewer wrote [my father] spent wwii fighting in the pacific john tolkien had spent wwii warm and cozy in oxford writing drivel um excuse me but you do know that tolkien fought in the first world war indeed it was around that time that he started writing his mythology right i guess not otherwise you wouldnt have written such a silly uninformed comment as for the book being sexist and racist thats purely a matter of interpretation certainly not shared by all the whole complaint about there being no people of color in the lord of the rings is anyway a weak one tolkien created lord of the rings as part of a greater mythology which he intended to be his vision of english myth since nothing substantial was in existence in that regard england is indigenously white as far as i am aware thus all the characters in the silmarillion and lotr are white let me put my point in the form of a question are there white people in african asian or south american myths no there are not thus its unfair to criticize the fact of an all white cast in tolkiens mythology yes i am aware of the easterlings in the book who are described as swarthy and of the fact that they are in league with the dark lord but swarthy does not necessarily mean black and their being both swarthy and bad has more to do with the fact of their geographical occurrence and the fact that they are men it wasnt only the swarthy people who were in cahoots with the dark lord even do i think this film is highly enjoyable i will rate it with only one star this is due to the fact that i think its position at the imdb top 250 is really unfair there are many movies that surpass this one in many aspects and they should be above this title i dont exactly know how the system works since the only votes that count are the ones from regular voters when do you become one but i will try to lower its position rating this film with only one star even do i think it deserves 6 or 7 the performances are truly above average but i think that the characters are not near as memorable on the other hand i liked the photography a lot and the story is really good but i think the movie should have ended about 10 minutes before like no country for old men i wrote this comment only to encourage people to do the same thing i am glad to see comments like mine which makes me thing that not everybody consider this title as the best movie ever because it is not i know it is a matter of subjectivity but when too many people give this film 10 stars we are denying that there are better films out thereit is neat to believe in your heart that you are hip and if you can obtain coolness by watching a movie wow i believe that everybody who says they like pulp fiction thinks they are cool they think that a movie with such style and witty banter is only for the hip the only problem is that this film is as empty as a scottish pay toilet and perhaps the most pretensious piece of nothing ever if you have not figured it out yet there is no story here tarantino simply shoots a pointless movie and then breaks it up so that we do not see it in its proper sequence so things that happen last come before things that finished before and vice versa you start to wonder gee am i not intelligent enough to follow this then you realize uhhh no it is actually fairly simple he is just stringing a bunch of scenes along in no particular order then he gives unrealistic and long winded speeches to characters that are not particularly realistic it does not make the film really bad but at the same time it does not make it good either you can paint a piece of crap all kinds of different colors but it is still a piece of crap i wonder if tarantino has the talent to actually tell a real story without having to resort to fancy tricks shocking scenes and other gimmicky tricks i doubt it oh well i guess i am just not that cool i mean samuel jackson sure did say some funny thingsthere are only three movies which i have rented that i refused to watch from beginning to end one is natural born killers another is blazing saddles and the third is this piece of trash pulp fiction which of the three is worse i cant say for sure suffice it to say however that anyone that has the stomach to sit through this jumbled nonsensical celloid wasteland of obscenity violence lasciviousness drug abuse immorality and thuggery ought to get a quick reality check before all is lost if there is a hell it is being forced to watch this movie over and over again not only is it horrid to watch but it makes not an ounce of sensefirst of all my comment doesnt have spoilers because there is absolutely nothing to spoil i intended to watch pulp fiction & reservoir dogs after i seen kill bill vol 1 & 2 which i really liked because of the same director quentin tarantino he became my favourite director after i seen kill bill vol 1 & 2 but no longer when i seen pulp fiction it has all the possible bad things in a film and the list is endless there is nothing but drug use and swearing that made my ears bleed the f word was repeated more times than the number of heartbeats of a persons lifetime none of the stories were appealingin fact i just dont know whats going on because there was no structure or plot the film was about 25 hours and i hated every second it was extremely boring that i had a sore head & i felt like ripping my arm out and constantly bash my head with it anyway i can go on forever i just dont know why its #5 on the imdb top 250 maybe because mostly people have accidentally clicked on 10 instead of 1 out of 10 quentin tarantino must have pulled the script from his bum and was running about in a circle with it then his wife must of hit him on the head with a rolling pin and said you promised me no more rubbish films he must of found a brain in a fruit bowl before he made kill bill he also looks like a idiot and talks like a girl now i dont intend to watch reservoir dogs crap fiction is now definitely on my top 5 worst films of all time and is in second place first is either jackass the movie 1 or 2 it is critically acclaimed because 97% of critics have no brains and the rest of the 3% have cheated in their exams that is why they always give good reviews to bad films and bad reviews to good films overall no matter what ever happens there will never be a worse film than crap fiction any movie in the imdb bottom 100 is better and i would like to salute anyone who has given it a 1 out of 10 this whole comment is only 1% expression of hate to this stupid crap junk garbage & good for nothing film i saw this in the theater with my girlfriend because she had seen it with some friends and said it was so good i made it through the whole thing somehow and as we were walking through the parking lot i just started thinking that this movie has sucked over 2 hours of life from me and ill never get it back i honestly felt dumber for watching the whole thing there is nothing good about this movie except a couple of members of the cast not travolta nor thurman and their ability was limited due to the awful script there is nothing groundbreaking about this movie the dialog is boring the characters have no depth it seems like it was made on a 24 hour deadline and they had plenty of spare time to go back and add an f word anywhere there was a space i wouldnt have cared less if tarantino had had another character that built an atomic bomb that accidentally detonated and wiped out everyone in this collection of trash this is by far one of the worst movies i have ever seen especially for something so highly praised peter jackson has successfully completed his evisceration of the lord of the rings by removing the heart of tolkiens the return of the king leaving it void of humanity or pathos jackson continues his confusing and odd choices in this film revealing no confidence in the source material relying instead on more comfortable hollywood clichÜ©s and tired camera setups which are augemented by the playstation effects that younger audience members have come to expect and which leave others hungry for the versimilitude of tolkiens mamoth and respected at least by some work to paraphrase a touchstone phrase from the 60s `frodos dead and peter jackson killed hima film about post war us life maybe i was tired while watching it but anyway i was disappointed nothing more than gangster movie at all marlon brando is excellent though i`m not going to say that it`s chicken feed but from my point view it has artificially created reputation la piovra italian tv series is much better in every pointi really dont understand people sometimes here we have the #1 rated movie on the list an extremely famous film a well made film in its own right but the story its awful this is a story about a man how starts off as a fine upstanding citizen a soldier no less and his gradual change into what i can only describe as a total st i really did not like this movie i did like it up to a pointonce i realized that michael was not going to overcome his demons i really dont feel i should waste any more time on this film so i wonti feel like im on another planet when i hear people talk about this movie it is probably the worst movie that i have ever seen its only rivals are the two previous lor movies was there some weird subliminal suggestion that im immune to were they serving some drugged cool aid that i missedif heath ledger deserved an oscar for this then why didnt mickey rourke win one for sin city simple answer is sin city is a film based on a comic book whereas the dark knight is some kind of post 9 11 view of the world in which terrorists like osama oledgers character go around blowing up buildings and sending the police and the worlds media videos or virals or what ever the hell those crappy scenes are supposed to represent in order to instill fear and panic nice one nolan for ruining a comic book fantasy by trying to be stanley kubrick or whoever the hell you were trying to be with this movie and i am getting fed up with people saying this is how batman should be represented just read the comic books wheres robin how the hell are they going to write the penguin or cat woman into the story it was okay with the joker because they just stole the look of james obars the crow and attached it to a caricature of certain terrorists that in the last 10 years have caused death and destruction and let a film go out to the worlds media every now and then just like the joker in this film to let everyone know there still around i cant even describe how pretentious this piece of cp is it was okay with batman begins but with this it seems as if nolans made a serious political statement while using the guise of a comic book that was written in the 1930s personally i think the first batman film despite its many flaws is still the only true representation of batman from gotham city to the noir aspects and even the characters heath ledgers joker is in no way comparable to the joker character bob kane created and the way he played the joker was just irritating i just wanted to punch him out i found him not in the least bit scary or intimidating he just needed a good punch to the throat if you want to check out some good performances of lunatics check out dennis hopper in blue velvet rutger hauer in the hitcher or gary oldman in leon who also happens to be the only good thing about this film christian bale is just cp as bruce wayne and batman like he was the last time and like he is in every other movie he has made with the exception of american psycho in which he played a tt basically just had to turn up to set and be himself but just like the godfather this is just going to be another over hyped piece of garbage that people rave on about for the next thousand years or until some other film maker makes another batman film where he is this time played by a woman in space on a space station fighting genghis khan because this is how far these movies are moving away from the source material this very film is based on the film is disgusting to look at as well at least burton and schumachers gotham citys looked original and yes i know he put the statue of liberty into batman forever but this film is just garbage and not just like new york they might as well as called this film heat as well seeing as it has so many shots of tall buildings in fact i might just go watch heat as it is a better made film without a pretentious plot and decent actors with a good script with well thought out direction and alarmingly a faster pace then this turgid piece of excrement if you want my advice watch batman 1 then heat and then turn on the news after that and you will pretty much get the gist of the dark knight but in a more enjoyable way and wont have to sit through this demoralising piece of rubbish if you happen to be below the age of thirteen or just a geek who cant get a girlfriend or boyfriend then you will probably think this film rules personally i think it is cp i wouldnt say this is a bad movie its still good entertainment compared to other 21th centuries block busters that fail in every possible way but it has nothing to do in the top 250 sorry imdb kids who know nothing about cinema took over your ranking system the main grudges id have about this movie would be 1 it is way too long itd been a while since i last experienced the feeling of expecting the credits to begin each time a scene would end i was like ok then the end and the movie would keep going into some nuke the fridge like action scene that has nothing to do with the main plot as if the directors told themselves people paying money to go to the theater want to have bang for their bucks so lets give them 56 explosions 87 wrecked cars and 77 dead guys fictive count but you get the idea toward the end i was completely out of the movie focusing on not peeing in my pants 2 whats with 2 face i didnt know about 2 face making an appearance in this episode i thought it was all about the jocker vs the world boy i was surprised to see this coming straight out of nowhere right in the middle of the movie but hey at that time i thought nice way to introduce 2 face could it be the next batman they make will have him as the main villain so i was kinda expecting a the end screen when say the jocker sets him free from the hospital so that the movie is still coherent with the others like ok this time batman half won the jocker is introduced as its arch ennemy and theres another freak out there to spice it up the end to be continued but the movies keeps going and going and going and going although its a totally different story its as if they packed 2 movies in 1 seriously they should have called it batman vs the jocker featuring 1 extra villain of course theres also the 2 face is dead thing when we all know hes coming back a few episodes later i cant understand why they made it that way it would have been so much easier to have for example the 2 of them drop into water and only have batman to reach the shore leaving a question mark over 2 faces fate completely clichÜ© sure but at least theyre not killing someone to have him reappear in a sequel oh hold on maybe batman and gordon and all the cops cant tell the difference between a corpse and a living fellow i could go on forever on all the flaws like _ cell phone crap yeaaaah right ok its batman but still and like 1 guy alone could trace millions in real time _ stupid prisoners dilemma in the boats since when criminals have morals _ i burn money cause i dont care but i rob banks stance of the joker _ the batcave is now located in an almost empty room in the docks _ alfred burns his masters letters come on why so serious alfred _ batman is strong with men but weak with dogs where is the batkick at _ batmans awful voice puberty at 35 between begins and tdk _ the joker has no plan but everything goes as planned every time _ the batpunch carpets big fellas but the jocker can handle it no problem _ crime syndicates give away their money to keep to some chinese guy nobody knows trusting him to keep it safe since when criminals trust each other over money concerns _ gotham changed a lot between 2 episodes and on and on i repeat this is not a bad movie itself its just way overrated its just another action movie that you go see to put your brain on low power mode for a couple of hours i would have put a 5 or 6 on it but we need to counterbalance the tens that cinema uneducated dumb kids put what a let down all this talk has talked up the movie and the only relationship with the reality of the movie is that in it theres way too much talking loads of earnest blah blah from the joker too and comically in a very throaty fashion from christian bale this would be an extremely rare misfire if hed had anything enough to do to actually affect its outcome batman is a characterless suit with a sore throat while the joker is a nutter unsurprisingly batman begins was a good film easily the best of the batman bunch this one is just a normal movie made kind of laughable by the corny dialog blah blah suit blah make up blah explosion blah suit make up blah explosion blah blah blahthis is the worst film ever to be made because its crp and it aint ready for the godfather all you re teachers understand that so all you re teachers be quiet before you get shanked 1the godfather 2the godfather pt 2 3inception shank redemption is worse then toy story the whole collection it is even worser than super babies to be honest with you dont worry it will soon be taken out of the number one slot by christopher nolan frank darabont is so sht at directing films he is worser then david yates im gonna make shank redemption an offer the film cant refruse the offer over long boring tedious over acted and very very very very very over rated hell knows what goes through the minds of people to vote this the 2nd best film ever i first saw the cut down version lasting 1 hour 25 minutes and it was still too long i wouldnt mind but its so drawn out fanciful and pathetic the things that happen in that prison would never happen just because some nerdy bank manager has hope give me a break which soap opera did that sad line come from no wonder it was initially ignored and it should be continued to be ignored robbins who is accused and wrongly convicted for the murders of his wife and her lover never ages at one point he has to remind us hes been in jail for 12 years because it only looks like a week yet did you see the way he really changed in 12 years from 1994 to 2006 he looks a much older man and of course he does hes 12 years older in the shamshank dedeption he never aged one day in 12 years and his hair is even cut the same style even when we then go forward something like 20 years he still looks the same never aged at all apart from a few bluey grey hairs at the sides and after he escapes after 20 years of tunnelling through thick concrete with a a small screwdriver he meets up with his old buddy freeman who got out of jail legally and get this both look younger than when they first went in by my reckoning tim robbins should now be about 70 and morgan freeman in his early 80s yet both after serving their time still look barely 40 and what a load of talkative rubbish the most boring over hyped up film in history complete twaddle god knows how on earth i watched all of it but i did if for a bet cause i cannot stand it wasnt worth a uk tenner anyway my vote 2 out of 10 for a mediocre drama get a life if this is the best film youve even seen better still get a cinema ticket or rent a dvd and more than one another one of those overlong morally right on movies that never rises above average saved only by the acting its bleeding heart politics dignity of individual maintained in adverse conditions is played out well enough but actually lacks any real dramatic tension dufrane is a two dimensional character who seems to go through the drama by numbers theres never any doubt that he will triumph in the end its only a matter of how tim robbins has done many more interesting films than this one try the player or bob roberts if youre looking for drama moral ambivalence and how they interact basically there are a lot better prison films than this one jailhouse rock for starters like most stephen king stories quite prosaic there was a story in here somewhere but it got over inflated and somewhat lost along the way one to watch on a rainy day when theres nothing better to dosorry folks but this movie is a c movie and not an a i cant believe that people like this movie so much yes i am biased i really dont like tim robbins but he has made a decent movie or two but this aint one of them this is your basic prison movie what can i say it has the host of usual characters the storyline is basic the outcome i wont say but it is just stupid to say that this is a great movie i didnt think it was realistic at all and anybody who falls for this crap is either delusional or needs some brains to differentiate between an edsel and a lamborghini i wouldnt watch this movie again unless i was paid to do so one viewing is enough for this predictable laugheri am a hardcore movie buff ive seen them all and studied them all of all the movies said to be the greatest of all time or a contender of one of the greatest of recent times this is the most undeserving do i really think that this is a 1 10 no i ranked it this low hoping 90 rating would eventually drop because 9 10 on this site in 4th place many other sites with this ranked either at the top or near the top what the hell i will say that this was well made the cinematography action and danger sequences were well done but not as good as say die hard heath ledgers performance as the joker is what carries the movie and is the nay reason why it is ranked so high without heath ledger as the joker the movie would have been as dull as the dark knight rises ledger gives one of the best performances in recent memory but people treat it like its better than de niro in raging bull or kevin spacey in american beauty because of him they also treat it like its up to par with the likes of schindlers list and shawshank redemption i gather those people have never seen either one because both those movies blow the dark knight out of the water what it my problem with this its concept is stupid citizens of gotham blame all crime on batman and bruce wayne agrees he thinks gothams true hero is da harvey dent dent may be waynes buddy he even he knows its bogus as the joker rises and spreads chaos batman is still treated like a villain and bruce just takes it what a dumb ass and thats what goes on throughout the whole movie you are responsible for all crime batman  open your eyes cant you see its the joker that doing all this youre welcome for me protecting you next time ill just let the joker kill you guys and let harvey dent save you i can see why they would label harvey dent as a hero but can he really save people from a burning building or falling off a cliff no thats what batman is for the movie is very slow practically getting nowhere and the character development isnt very strong the characters are developed into stunned pushovers good action the joker and two face were the only reasons this movie was worth watching joker and two face harvey dent where the only good characters in this it baffles me how high people can rate and praise such a generic movie the must not know how ratings work do they know who robert de niro is have they heard of steven spielberg have they seen gone with the wind maybe this movie isnt as bad as i said but it is so overrated i get sick of it easily and strongly believe it does not deserve the praise it gets the dark knight is one of the worst films i have ever seen ive disliked most of christopher nolans prior work but was willing to be converted and the rave reviews psyched me up drained of humor even black plot less structurally inept poorly shot one third of the movie coming across as a pierce brosnan bond movie bale even goes into bond autopilot without noticing nolan hasnt a clue how to make pictures or what makes humans tick and i wish the undeserved hype around him as a director ended now ledger is dreadful but the poor chaps role is so wretchedly written that his character never stands a chance not to mention nolans amateurish decision to make ledger copy vincent prices thriller voice undermining any authority the character is supposed to have by attempting to ground the batman mythology in contemporary reality it just comes across as plain silly nolan makes films for technology age emotionless drudges hiding their lack of self esteem and identity crises behind a mask of hipness and faux aggression by going to see the dark knight nolan is dictating to them that they are cool and superior that the film is a horrible poorly made highly manipulative piece of work is irrelevant first and for most the movie was far too long there was no reason for it to be 3 hours and 21 mins much of the film could have been edited and it would have still had the same effectas for all the people who felt the length was good or wish it had been longer buy the dvd and watch the deleted scenses second to much of the film was way to unrealistic even in a place like middle earth im not going to go into any detail on this because some people may not have seen the film but take note also many of the things which could have made this an exciting film were cut short such as the dealings with the witch king besides some great special effects and nice cinematography the film was a huge disappointment in conclusion i am left with a few question how did so many people trick themselves into liking this moive and how did it get to number 3 on the users choice poll omg heath got depressed because of playing this silly lunatic joker is emanation of evil the dark knight is no4 on imdb list please this is typical and so average action flick with really stellar cast most of my favorite actors are here caine bale oldman and some other i usually enjoy watching freeman eckhart gyllenhaal but it was all in vain because at first place i like movies with message or those thatll make you think fe figt club dogville american beauty and if theres no message or possibility of insight i like to be entertained fe noises off corpse bride the curse of the black pearl even st trinians and mamma mia although shallow and naive they make you smile sing dance but this one 1 message äóñ none this movie wont make you think about your life wont change your point of view wont make you a better person wont even make you think at all 2 fun äóñ a lot if you like violence blowing things up fire killing otherwise none too long boring shallow no dialogs no humor nothing thank god ive waited for dvd so i could use fast forward ill give it 5 10 in my notebook but just 1 here because its waaaay overrated now i know rating a film awful is a bit much but calling this film a master piece and smashing the 10 out of 10 down is also a bit extreme the critics may like this film but seeing as ive read the source material i can see theres much more interesting and subtle ways to handle the films message the message of the film is in your face and i guarantee its contradictory to itself if you pay attention to the film the joker is an interesting character ill give heath that but he seems a bit all too knowing almost always reading peoples actions before they do it themselves that is a bit problematic when nolan is labeling his film to be realistic anyway the jokers plans are too well thought out and constructed to be considered chaotic or anarchic theres always a strict sense of structure in his chaos this along with the actions of other characters make the film seem like its preaching a message because everyone shows up and does a special part and then disappears including the man himself batman so its not a real life situation cause and effect the social experiment so to put it is done in an unbelievable way and when you see it youll know what im talking about if nolan is trying to comment on society he should at least do it right the performances are good especially ledger and oldman however bale needs to be directed a little different when performing his batman voice the rest of the movie lacks style and becomes boring a blue filter doesnt make up for good old fashioned symbolic imagery also there are several things changed from the comics that inspired this film and i can say the change is for the worse each time without the performances this film would just be a heat copycat because of the advance publicity a few posters and an all star lineup of actors we planned to see pulp fiction as soon as it came out i took my sister to see this movie on opening day in college station tx the theater charged premium rates for the show the two tickets cost me $70 what a mistake it was so boring that we walked out after approximately 30 minutes and went for drinks instead the only redeeming point to the evening was that i only wasted 30 minutes and $70 i can at least cling to not having wasted several hours this movie ignore the comments made by people who want to pretend they didnt get taken save your cash and see something entertaining i saw this movie when it was just past its prime at a dollar theater and boy was i ripped off this is absolutely the worst movie i have ever seen it along with fargo and natural born killers are my top 3 worst films i have no problem with films that are quirky but this film made absolutely no sense to me sometimes i will give a film a second chance and watch it again thinking maybe it was just my mood on that particular day but i would never waste my time on this movie againwell the lord of the rings trilogy seems to be a cheap action movie which hasnt much common with the great book from tolkin the return of the king has some nice battle scenes but its just another action movie with mostly good special effects many good parts of the original book where totally twisted mixed or deleted with not much sense and some very stupid parts are just invented from peter jackson to show more of this not so impressive orlando blum its good that tolkin cant see this movie i just hope it makes him not spinning in his grave my hint to peter jackson stay at your roots and make more splatter movies like braindead people do not understand cinema i see the movie the fighter with top stars and sure it gets oscars or the godfather oh ya great movie i just watched a movie called rockaway 2007 a movie where the main actor is just a normal man and yes he acts normal and looks normal but the power that can come from a normal man explodes in this movie rockaway the people who rate the fighter or the godfather with high ratings or liked it any are people with a low iq they probably like these types of movies because cuz they like crime like the godfather the godfather is trash this little dude in rockaway 2007 this movie mostly uses intelligence to take down the mob and its godfather i cannot stand the movie the godfather because america is praising crime and gangsters this movie shows how one mans determination to stop a gang of thugs is expelled mostly with intelligence training determination and more i cannot stand the oscar and academy award panel they do not know how to judge films i will sing to everything good when the day comes and people stop admiring trash like the fighter and the godfather i get a kick out of the movie rockaway because the character can be a good role model he is not a criminal drug addict and he isnt stupid when we watch the fighter or the godfather you see top american actors committing crime drugs and utter stupidity but in rockaway a regular american or hispanic not sure man comes back to town to take down the entire russian mob he even takes down the godfather of the mob while he is blind after his eyes were taken out i am thankful that i am not stupid enough to be excited when the bad guys mobsters win i am the type of guy that likes to go to work without the mafia trying to get in my way mobs and gangsters and their movies just dont excite me but seeing this high rating helps me to understand why there is so much crime in america and why most people are too scared to go outside hahai dont why people had ranked this movie so high but there is nothing in this movie which is good expect john and jackman samuels actingthis is slowest movie i have ever seen the parts like start with boss wife is not needed when i have seen rating of this movie i was really exited to see it i bought the movie cd when i stated watching movie is good at start it attracts mine interest but after the two stories the third seems much boring and after that the others are also boring and does not make any sense i thought that there will be any suspense in the last part but what i thought was crap so movie is much much below mine expectationswell if you think this movie was better than se7en fight club matrixpsycho etc then you must have cinemathis movie is a good action movie but has literally nothint in it worth paying attention the clown is none spookier than a spider your little sister thats right pssy already squashed and most of the characters dont know what they talk about joker wants to create havoc using paranoiac scyzophrenics which would be the equivalent of trying to chop a sequoia with a rotten salmon since paranoiac schyzophrencs dont know the difference between reality guns banks etc two face is just useless and the movie has no message whatsoever even the joker doesnt know the difference between chaos and anarchy i could go on and on about the stupidity manifested in this film but if you dont care about your own why would you not vote an unworthy film to be the 6th best film wont know where it will be when you read it but hope that it descends to at least 500th place like this shame on you but if you hate cinema you just have to follown the work of adam sandler ps go back to playing lego kid i read a while back that the godfather was a favorite book of an author i enjoy i hence picked up a copy and was enthralled i had heard how great the movie was so i watched it and i was appalled i grant you the movie follows the book closely but it doesnt understand what makes the book work most of the actors know what to do and al pacino is perfect but marlon brando is clueless vito corleone is not a thinly veiled thug he is a caring man who is forced to do some horrible things but in the end he accomplishes far more good than evil this only makes micheals transformation in the book more horrible because the deaths he commits serve no such higher purpose also scenes of great importance are removed johnny fontane is barely in it santinos girlfriend has a cameo and the doctor is nowhere to be found i know these characters dont directly effect the plot but they give it an emotional foundation to build upon i cared about them more than any of the other characters i know coppola had to cut the book down for time to do a movie but he would have been better off doing a mini series instead ok i really dont care what anyone says about this film this movie stinks in all areas there is bad acting bad directing bad plot and absolutely and i mean absolutely no action to speak of and some of the silliest characters i have ever seen i could picture the real mafia laughing their head off at this lame attempt as far as mafia movies go this is definitely the britney spears and backstreet boys of mafia movies its so pop culture its laughable al pacino and company are terribly overwhelmed they are not talented enough to cover mafia movies there are so many better ones ive seen from the 50s and 60s not to mention a modern one like goodfellas the godfather truly stinks to high heaventhis movie totally sucks to infinite and beyondhow the hell is it good its total crap low budget crap actors al pacino sucks marlon brando sucks no violence no gore crap story without a doubt the worst movie i have ever seen the best part is the end of this piece of crap franciss ford coopla should be ashemed of himself for this boringlow budget piece of crap how is it number 1 whats so good about it its pure sit should be number 1 at the worst movie ever made the ultra cruel horses head in the bed scene al pacinos crap acting no guns no violence no nudity christ mario puzo should be ashamed of of himself for this garbage its nowhere near as bad as goodfellas which was crap from beginning to end i hate martin scorese and stupid francis ford coopla they couldnt even make porn look good stick right away from this rubbishi fail to see how people are actually taking this movie seriously batman is meant to be an enjoyable superhero comic book blockbuster but that is all the film makers feeble attempt to make things more serious by throwing in the cringing ferry and solar phone tap scene were embarrassingly unnecessary and came off as patronising to the audience furthermore the use of real ny style sky scrapers for gotham city in some far from subtle way of making more 9 11 america comparisons ruined the distorted and macabre atmosphere of gotham city that tim burton had translated so well onto screen the fictional comic book edge was further lost by showing us the jokers violent followers from behind to expose their masks while all this might have made the movie fresher and more realistic why keep the entirely unbelievable and cackling joker character instead heath ledgers excellent performance feels out of place with the rest of the movie and while heath did play the joker very well it is not exactly difficult to play a cartoon fictional and face painted psycho if you want to see a real oscar winning performance of a psychopath watch monster 2006 if he gets the oscar sympathy vote for this i would have no more respect for the academy and its flawed voting processjust like the joker i am also a little curious about the primitive nature of human beings in our society not that im immune myself but it always amazes me to see the exponential effect of hype to watch humans horde into a frenzy of blissful ignorance let me make myself clear heath ledgers performance alone is worth the ticket price to see this movie he is stunning and he destroys jack nicholsons performance and i say this knowing that i had previously thought no one can do joker as good as jack nicholson but joker is only a third of this movie and a shame in hindsight the rest of this film is a just mish mash of tension pace plot and action 1 christopher nolan struggles with action scenes they are confusing chaotic and illogical which culminates into an underwhelming visceral and cerebral experience somewhat boring 2 batman is a lifeless and dull character in batman begins this was ok because he was mostly swinging from the corner of the screen like a predator but given a more open role batman in a cape was distracting his metamorphosis as batman was absorbing to experience in the first film but the conflicts he faces in this sequel pale in comparison batman is too sensitive and too poetic in his choice of resolutions ready to reveal his identity too quickly and ready to become a dark knight based on the pompous premise dent must remain the white light 3 two face is an oddball an oddball of creation of reaction and of evolution his arch is a forced effort by nolan it doesnt make sense for him to kill gordons family dent himself commented that he knew his job was dangerous he knew that there were bad people after him why the sudden transformation when this happened the transformation of two face was based on the premise of his philosophical awakening that to believe in chance is to believe in chaos but i cant believe this would cause such an explosive change in him willing to kill a child it doesnt make sense two face as caricature was not near as engaging or entertaining 4 the pacing of this film is poor there are moments where it is too fast and moments where the film is too slow effectively i think the movie should have ended sooner it dragged out and i was mostly non responsive to the conclusion of two face 5 ultimately for a movie to be amazing one must come out of a cinema and be amazed i didnt like the movie in its entirety and i truly believe that had heath ledger not been involved in dark knight the general consensus would have been a lot different and the flaws a lot more glaringly obvious this was a 25 hour movie in which everything but joker was underwhelming it was a good movie but given the hype its now everyones favorite film of all time as the imdb ratings might soon suggestwow cant believe how high the rating is for this film on imdb did we all see the same film wow okay just got back from seeing this and i gotta say i was very very disappointed overall the movie had its moments but maaaan oh maaaan was this movie way too long and unnecessarily so so far christian bale has proved to be a satisfying batman but no one has lived up to my vision of what batman should truly be up on the big screen that said lets move on the viewing experience the worse part about this movie for me was the editing it was unforgivably choppy too many scenes ended too abruptly and i guess a whole lot of stuff happened off camera because there were a considerable amount of gaping plot holes the action very intense from the beginning which was great but the movie peetered out toward the end that whole scene with harvey dent holding gordons family hostage was just way too long and too over the top dents transformation into evil happened too quickly which made his descent into bat villain unconvincing it was like he was having a very bad tantrum thats all he needed to be spanked or hugged nope despite what you may read there wasnt anything poetic about it sorry freudians coolest scenes i really liked the confrontation scene at the jail between batman and the joker great great stuff batman was extremely close to losin it and i thought for a second he just may kill him he just might snap and do it but nah batman isnt nearly as amoral as ol clown face another scene i liked was when batman was in hong kong kickin some baddies asses then he grabs the head honcho asian dudecant remember his name sorry launches some balloon thingy in the sky hooks himself and the baddie to an oncoming plane which of course was all arrangedi wonder who was flying the thing lucius which takes off into the night sky that scene was tight executed brilliantly most memorable scenes the joker making that pencil disappear the joker walking away in a nurses uniform as bombs go off behind him classic those images will stay with me for a long long time coolest toy the batpod geeks will cheer performances heath ledger was good yes did he give me chills and simply blow me away sadly no but perhaps i was expecting way too much after all the buzz on his performance as the joker started way back in january does he deserve a posthumous oscar no an oscar nomination should more than suffice for the kudos hes been getting his death is what has swayed or rather manipulated people to say this is the most incredible performance ever seen on screen dont be so gullible its a good performance dont get me wrong but its not history making however heath now makes nicholsons joker look as campy and as ridiculous as cesar romero christian bale had his moments so did aaron eckhart gary oldman is always a pleasure to watch morgan freeman and michael caine will always be veterans of their craft everyone else could have phoned it in the music not memorable and in some scenes shrill and annoying where or where is danny elfman what bugged me the most batmans gravelly and super loud voice it sounded completely ridiculous and over amplified not menacing just ridiculous i thought the script tried too hard to send a message what we got was sophomoric rhetoric which was overly preachy the ending a dud even though the movie was an agonizing 25 hours i still felt something was missing batman being hunted down by gordon and the gcpd was lame the nolan brothers shouldve written a much more satisfying ending i felt cheated there was not enough of a satisfying denouement for the joker he was just left hanging there upside down giggling like a school girl on crack they shouldve given the joker a much more satisfying final scene like that last shot of anthony perkins in psycho staring chillingly into the camera jokers exit should have been just as memorable and just as scary what they gave us was weak pure and simple and that really really sucks since it was indeed heaths final scene his final image up on the big screen doing what he loved the most they couldve given him a better tribute than that what id like to have seen the joker being funny come on people thats what the joker has always been about not campy but funny heaths interpretation of the joker was nothing like in the comics i understand the nolan brothers wanting to be dark and all that but lets get real and stick to story origins okay the joker is a demented psychopath yes but hes also supposed to be wickedly funny you know laughing at his own sick twisted humor we got none of that from heaths portrayal what he played was a character who shouldve been named the sicko or the money burner or chaos man in any case the nolan brothers to me failed to give us the joker we all really wanted to see again i liked heaths performance i did but there was still so much missing overall review i was entertained by this film but was sadly disappointed with the pacing the editing and some of the gaping plot holes and what sucks is that im a huge batman fan huge i soooo wanted this film to be a masterpiece but it wasnt not by a longshot i actually gave this movie a 6 out of 10 stars but most of you made this movies rating on imdb just unforgivably too high good cinematography and special effects makes a perfect movie well according to most people i guess so but for people like me unfortunately there arent too many of us individual minded thinkers left it takes a good story to lure us in to me this movie tried noticeably hard to pack everything together and failed of course unless good cinematography and special effects gives you a hard on a way overdone story with an unrealistic genius villain loaded with shattering glass and more shattering glass is what i got out of it one thing after another made me feel like i was watching batman the law & order miniseries oh yeah for one of the best if not the best movie of all time this thing didnt leave me in awe for a second or raise the hair on my arm one bit like so many movies with a believable likable story funny to think how well this film would have done if you could take away lets see the cinematography and special effects there is not really any reasonable explanation why there are so many junk movies with ratings over 8 in imdb except the fact that unfortunately we are living in the age of materialism and total commercialism before mentioning anything about the dark knight itself i should point out that the movie business started as an experiment and furthermore it was and i hope it still is art if you are a part of the lucky people that had the chance to watch old movies starting from the early 1900s then you probably have noticed that despite the bad quality the technique and the style of directing cinematography acting and special effects are fascinating they are modern sincere effective touching thats where art starts and flourishes however if you take all the pointed out and replace them with high quality computer effects deafening soundtrack good looking actors banal plot and the appealing to the masses simple conflict of good vs bad well here is where commercialism begins its unstoppable brainwashing system the dark knight fits exactly the formula nothing more to say to those who agree there are still some great new movies coming out it just takes time to find them dont be discouraged by the overwhelming amount of junk films to those who disagree well consider watching casablanca silence of the lambs amadeus star wars p etc to those who dont take a side now is the time to do so to heath ledger you were just great and sorry to know this was the last time to see you [17 june 2009] later here now as i watched the film for a second time so that i would be entirely fair in my judgment i realized that 8 10 is a fair rating but and only but when the dark knight is rated on a different scale such as top movies based on a comics and what is a comics other than a combination of a simple plot good vs evil black and white characters lots of action the end when a movie has nothing more to add no fair character development acting no original twists in the chain of events no unique directing techniques then one cannot give it more than 5 10 and since the imdb has a great image the only way users can help keeping it safe and sound is by taking a little more seriously their voting rights [30 june 2009] ill keep this short i rarely go to the theater but with the hype i had to go see this batman and the joker are invincible characters you know they wont die plot hole the police have the joker in an interrogation room with 30 officers on the other side of a 1 way mirror and the joker just killed the mayor the day before what do the police do any logical person in that situation would kill the joker period just shoot him i nearly walked out of the theater when the joker escaped imagine that heres the thing the joker isnt a serial villain here hes a terrorist hes osama bin laden normal rules of police interrogation shouldnt apply here and wheres the military the fbi this story made no sense to me well i tried to keep this short i want my 25 hours of my life backas a guy who loves the batman character and used to own a chain of comics stores in the late 80s through the 90s i found the new batman film to be abominable the handling of the batman character was the worst i have ever seen and i say that being someone who hates all of the other batman movies with the exception of batman begins it was a classic modern tearing down of an iconoclastic hero that was less realistic than its printed counterpart the batman character would never consider revealing his identity to appease the joker because he understands that you cannot appease pure evil he would instead redouble his efforts to find the joker not eating or sleeping until he did the batman of the comics is a detective who uses classical detecting techniques coupled with a healthy dose of bruised knuckles as he harasses the underworld to find his query in other words he uses no shortcuts he works hard hollywood used the opportunity to make a political statement having batman build a machine that taps into every cell phone in gotham city allowing for the altruistic lucius foxx character to opine about this act of immorality a none to subtle swipe at the bush administration then you have harvey dent two face who as the da of gotham is described by batman as the best of us all killing two dirty cops and to save the fragile collective psyche of gotham city batman takes the blame for the deaths of the cops why it would not make more since to simply reveal to the public that harvey dent went coo coo after the death of the women he loved as a result of another act of murder perpetrated by the joker with the help of the aforementioned dirty cops and the trauma of being disfigured is beyond me save that it fits into the paradigm of liberal thought that the people are to be protected from the grim reality of the world better to tear down the real hero of the saga and have him chased by the police keep in mind that the film establishes that the villains of gotham know from experience that batman will not cross the line and kill the worst of them but we are supposed to believe that the public of gotham will swallow that batman would kill two innocent cops wow batman is a character who is truly good and he has been tarnished by this film in a world where superman in his last film was reduced to a peeping tom hero with a babies mama psychopaths like marvels wolverine and the punisher are hailed as modern heroes a world where so many young people leave the theater declaring how cool heath ledger is as the joker and not how scary the character is i find that world tragic as one of our old comic shop patrons used to say give me the days when a hero had a letter on his chest a magic word a cape and a pet or side kick a hero that fought the bad guys because he was good and they were bad and they needed their a$$e$ kicked let justice be done i gotta go against the grain here but after all the hype ive read here i expected no less than cinematic greatness what i got instead is that i got bored right out the theater its the only movie i actually walk out on this year and ive seen some pretty bad ones scenario linear predictable dark long and boring main actorchristian bale give me a break ive seen trees with more emotional depth supporting actors yeah ok heath ledger performance as the joker was inspired to say the least i was impressed a very difficult character to impersonate and he pulled it off the rest of the crew was adequate no more special effect great but were used to seeing great by now and theres too much of it editing inconsistent with bad rhythm music standard hollywood canned fare i found the whole indigestible rooting for the joker to kill them all about 3 4 of the way in so it would end and i could walk out ended walking out anyway without even caring how it endsthere is nothing special about this movie period nothiing special it tries on so many levels to be this big mega movie and in financial terms it was but you know what its still not good no matter how many fans it has no matter how much money it pulls in those are just figures and numbers and theyre quite boring in the long run lets go over a few reasons why it was not good first off the story bites off way more than is necessary we have bruce wayne in this ridiculous attempt to win back a woman hell never have the chance to be with the woman he is in love with prances around like a little school girl and really has no business being in the story to begin with she is just there to make both batman and harvey dent rival each other im so sure that the writers could have come up with a better plan to pit the two against each other than that then theres the jokerthe most ridiculous part of the story ridiculous because of the lengths and the means that the filmmakers took to bring a new kind of villain its not entertaining its not disturbing its just sick this movie was not fun it was not entertaining it was a product for the mindless audiences who were going to buy into it anyway and especially because of the death of heath edger lets talk a little about that this film had success that rode the curtail of ledgers death the studio deliberately used the poor suffering of a human being to push a film into exhibition thats really sad and you know what else its all this film will ever bethe last film of heath ledger and america went to see it because he died before its release sad really sad i didnt like it and i bet others will not like me for that very reason even more sad stillthis is the second worst film i have ever paid to see in a cinema the worst was zoolander where to begin the ersatz brooding music the inane plot the heavyweight philosophical dilemma posed by the two ferries episode the overacting the deeply pathetic ending there was much made in the british press about its violent content and the unsuitability of its certificate after seeing it all i can say is i didnt find the violence objectionable but emerged thinking that perhaps a new certificate is needed for the irredeemably crap avoid the tragedy of this and what personally makes me angry is that directors like loach and leigh could probably have made ten films on this budget even someone more expensive and supremely talented in the fantasy genre like gilliam or del torro could have made several what a waste i think this movie deserves 7 stars but i give it 1 star because i dont think this movie should be so high in the top 250 imdb list i liked the performance of heath ledger as the joker that is why i think many people gave to the dark knight 10 stars and of course besides the great marketing that this movie had i didnt like the voice that christian bale used when he was dressed like batman he sounded so rare i think heath ledger is going to be nominated for the oscar awards for his performance as the joker in the supporting actor category in short this is a good movie but an overrated movie i have enjoyed every outing of batman till i watched the dark knight and batman begins the basic story from a comic book is a comic story as soon as it is put into a semblance of real life it fails the main character is a man who dresses up as a bat this is funny the dark knight trilogy is made by people with no sense of humor who cares about lunatics that wear weird costumes and commit crimes in the real world these pathetic folks would be locked up the original batman tv show and tim burtons outings maintain the humor inherent in the story subtract the humor and you have long dull scenes in between action sequences get rid of the long talky scenes and the dark knight films would be fair action films if you are like me and prefer light and humor these films are not for you even breaking bad had some humor in it i maintain that batman is inherently humorous and thus the dark knight series fails to capture or honor the originali saw the dark knight last night and although the movie itself isnt too bad its not as good as the batman fanboys would like you to believe the film has still a lot of flaws and the playtime is just too long ive seen people walk out 30 minutes before the movie ended just out of pure boredom if they would have made the film at a faster rate it would have been a lot better then theres batmans voice its absolutely absurt nobody talks like that well maybe ned from jimbo & ned southpark but really it makes the whole movie one big joke the side characters get far to little attention i cant remember any of their names only positive thing about this movie is the joker who makes an interesting bad guy i would have rated this movie a 6 because its not awful but im going to give it a 1 just because the current rate 92 is totally overratedthis movie was ok but it wasnt anywhere near as good as people claimed heath ledgers performance as the joker was great but his dialog for the most part was not all that interesting i was having fun with him at first especially when he told the story about how he got his scars the first time anyway but when he told that story the second time i was not impressed once was more then enough when it all comes down to it this movie was simply ok but because the death of heath ledger was such a shocker to the hollywood community this film got way more credit than it deserved and thats all there is too itspoilers this has to be one of the most boring movies in existencewith the exception of superman to me star wars has always been about the action scenes but theres barely any of them going on in this film the sappy romance subplot between han and leia falls flat on its face being too predictable the only good thing was vaders revelation that he was his father to luke and that wasnt even confirmed until the next filmi think i read something about that at one point it originally turned out vader was messing with lukes head all in all a weak film in the middle of the series bottom line the worst star wars movie yes i am including menace i love the lord of the rings all 3 included i love the epic extremely long nature 3 hrs+ each that really allows the viewer to become immersed in the world that being said as much as a movie like braveheart is extremely under rated for its amazing acting directing etc lord of the rings is conversely overrated exhibiting in many instances very poor acting gimli anyone a weak translation of the book the books blow the movie away and truly subpar directing regardless of what the academy or any one of you fools may think lotr could have been a truly epic masterpiece if directed and acted accordingly however it still remains a very entertaining movie even with all of its flaws albeit in ten years it may unfortunately only be remembered as the most overrated movie in history 45 all time are you kidding me that is absolutely rediculous which is really a shame for such an ambitious fun to watch moviei had such high hopes when i first heard that a tolkien fan was going to write and direct a live action+cgi version of lord of the rings only to have them cruelly dashed fotr was a bit rough but i said to myself itll only get better boy was i wrong i suppose the main problem is twofold first jackson is way too young inexperienced to have taken on this project he certain has ability but he has a lot to learn about filmmaking before even thinking about tackling such an ambitious project second for alleged lovers of the source material jackson and company took way too many liberties with the story changing them in pointless and even foolish ways perhaps this was inexperience maybe it was just laziness or a lack of understanding of the source material goodness knows that lotr is far from perfect as an example of storytelling but there is a great tale buried in tolkiens massive tome too bad that jackson and his crew were absolutely unable to bring it to the screen by the trotk jacksons exhaustion is practically oozing from the screen and hes lost sight of many key elements of the story i just got home and i must say that i am not as satisfied as i thought i would be the film is very good but in my opinion is far way to be considered the best of the trilogy both previous movies were more intense than this one the battle scenes are awesome but the rest is very slow and quite difficult to stand for three and a half hour the ending is boring and that scene where legolas beats a mummakill cmon what does an army stands for if a single elf can handle such beast a third part of a trilogy which is in the 3rd place it seems to me that much of the stylistic elements of the movie were taken from the 1955 film kiss me deadly kiss me deadly was full of quirky characters and had a mysterious chest which contained a glowing object the main difference in style was that the humor in kiss me deadly is much more subtle while pulp fiction is trying real hard to get a laugh or a reaction because of that i feel that kiss me deadly is the far superior of the twoi really enjoyed this movie well about 45 minutes of it unless you are a die hard fanatic for the lotr books and maybe even then youll want to watch this with one finger on the fast forward button some scenes were excellent but not enough when diluted by so much filler the special effects may have been masterful but they didnt make it a great movie the movie simply takes itself far too seriously how else could the director possibly justify being almost 35 hours long similarly to voters here this is rated as #3 in the top 250 of all time that is so astoundingly overrated that i cannot understand it this with 65000+ votes it probably belongs in the top 1000 perhaps about #800 [how has the studio managed to create 45k+ imdb accounts to skew the voting] the basic flaw of the entire trilogy is that its based on a long winded violently racists set of books starting from that you end up with well you know truthfully this is a 7 10 but it could have been a 75 if theyd actually done some editing down to ~15 hoursthis isnt actually a review of this movie but a review of the top 100 movies list here obviously if the majority of users on imdb rate lord of the rings the return of the king as the 4th best movie ever there either arent many users over 14 or the majority of users know very little about good film making im sure i could easily come up with 100 movies that are better than all 3 lord of the rings movies thats really all i wanted to say is that by rating lotr as one of the best movies ever youre proving to the world how useless this site is for knowledgeable critical movie reviews how can one take the ratings on this site seriously after having realized that lotr is the #4 best movie ever according to imdb usersthis movie has to be the most overrated movie of all time i dont understand why everyone raves about this movie its boring the acting is shallow and weak the whole premise is annoying and i had to fight off sleep 3 times to finish this movie this movie has two layers boring barely audible speech and explosions i didnt think it to be possible but even the explosions were boring where does the fascination for this movie come from marlon brando may have been a good early actor but this ill make him an offer he cant refuse old man voice is so irritating i almost threw the dvd out the window however the movie ended up numbing all my extremities so that it was impossible to move as i had no choice but to sit on in horror im sorry i ever wasted my time on this piece of garbage with a weak premise ludicrous character designs and a plot that could cure insomnia godfather sleeps with the fishes with a 1 out of 10 i hated it the movie was so long and it was hard to follow the sequels were ok i feel that this movie was over rated way too much so it had a good year in the seventies but come on how can this boring movie stand for 3 decades i just dont understand how that is possible marlon brando has had much better roles in on the waterfront a streetcar named desire and don juan marco just to name a few pacino wasnt even that good i much preferred him in carlitos way and donnie bras co and who could forget scarface pacino is getting typecast i think the only reason he did simone was to get away from the typecasting as a mobster or criminal i have to say i cant blame him pacino is also getting typecast as a cop i mean insomnia come on pulp fiction is one of the films they animated the students for the school mass acer in usa and all the other countries making a joke and kill men just in time that is modern massacer what a joke only not for the victims awful and so called in german brechmittel that is the real classification who want to see such a stupid story american people who vote with an average of 82 i cant understand are there so many cinema fans with boodles of beer in there hands or lines with cocaine and problems in there brains i dont know and i wonder me that there are ten lines necessary to vote for an awful film oh i see there must be ten lines and one line i have to write and with this line i reech it actually i was hoping for a grand finale since the first installment was a glorious epic tale and the second was a piece of rubbish i was thinking that this moive would at least save the triologys face all starts good with a nice version of the becoming of gollum but to my dissapointment once again the story is told with the use of too much action scenes and some bland conversations and a gruesome amount of corny one liners the feel of an epic dissappears the moment the first flashback comes and the undeniably bad actress liv taylor makes an appearance yuck adn whats the deal with eowen she was alright in the two towers but now she suddenly becomes this girl power icon im not a man she says and slays a nazgul so what you say well its not the fact that she isnt a man that kills the witchmaster but the fact that its a elven blade that strikes him and if i recall it correctly its merry who deals that strike if the movie only would of stayed true to the book why doesnt it this was a once in an eternity opportunity and that dork peter jackson blew it as a movie fan im appaled and as a tolkien fan im angry rape this movie will change you as some have commented it will bring you to a disgusting low definitely skip it or youll be sorry you didnt its a sickening wretchingly vile voyueristic wannabe false glorification skip it in fact be happy to skip it sometimes i think we have a big pile of juvenile retards on imdb that only hope to vote for any movie along the lines of its inherent jerry springer qualities and the judgement comes as a message about how low and worthless it can get this movie is not entertaining it is not nice it is not realistic it is racist degrading and stupid dont waste your money your time or your lifei cant believe that i wasted my life on this crap my dog sonny died yesterday because i made him sit through this flaming pile of horse excrement he ended up hijacking a semi and driving it into the grand canyon i sniffed the tv while this was playing and lemme tell you it smelled like freaking turds if i ever saw this movie again i would have to do things that will have me killed in every country to the filmmakers actors actresses animals and trees associated with this rotten indian food covered in bird feathers once i had a drink of water the water had a worm in it i didnt know that at the timenow back to the review i missed that worm he crawled out of me like that creature from the movie alien the doctors said i was gonna die i guess i showed them they will learn the true meaning of suffering they will feel the wrath of bob the worm anyway the godfather killed my dog so therefore it sucks donkey poop peace it sucks 1 10 this is what i call a fad movie people say it is a great movie because other people said it is great people are afraid to express their true feelings because they dont want to be ridiculed by their friends especially if one is a member of the so called x generation i would imagine that the number of people who rented the video or saw it on cable that stopped watching the movie because it was so bad is fairly high especially for a movie that is considered a great movie however i concede that a number of people truly like it however i find that there are just as many people who are repulsed by this movie they just dont express their feelings in this type of format because a bad movie isnt worth the effort of making a negative opinionthe movie is about an accountant who is accused of murdering his wife and her lover and as a result is sentenced for a life in prison the movie is filled with deep meanings but unfortunately it is very boring and directed in a very lame way plus the musical score is preety bad and does not spark any emotions from you in this type of movie an emotional and memorable musical score is very important but somehow the filmmakers did not seem to carei watched the film 20 years later since its making and attain 0% satisfaction of viewing pleasure considering its 5h top position on imdb the movie is an experimental art house crap that chooses no destination and lack brilliant appealing sketching of its theme the dialogues are the heartbeat of the film that lose its rhythm every moment when stretching same words to make viewers understood the characterss stand view in perplexing crime world and how they perceive the one thing the film depressingly is in desire of clapping is bruce willis part of a boxer who is feared but not a coward the rare male protagonist with conscience uma thurman leaves a desire to see her complicated struggle with drug lust and hunger to live free tarantino has tried to harvest a violent creativity but the offspring emits extragalactic passion that fail to make any beauty i have watched it and guarantee you waste of time the acclaim for pulp fiction shows just how ethically sick many of us in this culture have become this movie makes a joke out of murder torture and shooting heroin tarantino isnt making fun of these people or even the pulp fiction genre hes celebrating them he gets off on all of this and he hopes we will too if its hip to think that this celebration of evil is cool then i want to be as unhip as possible being a teacher of modern german and russian history you might say im not inclined to see physical brutality as entertainment and i frankly dont give a rats a for the opinion of all those clowns who gush over how tremendous this garbage is best movie of the 90s hands down what a crock  this film typifies what is wrong with the whole film world today when a morally bankruptintellectually challenged creep like the director of this piece can get a deal with a major studio it says a lot about the sad and pathetic state of movie making the level of hype surrounding this and the other place epithet here made by this twerp is disgusting what drugs are being passed around in hollywood board rooms id really like to know what kind of hallucinogenic it was i saw this place epithet here and i was disturbed in the way it manipulates the stupider members of the audience getting high on violence is a good thing tarantino is a cancerous festering oozing lesion on the anus of the film world good film making technique aside are we really prepared for the level of nihilism this kind of place epithet here represents this is just place epithet here elevated to olympian art film status the presence of some reasonably good actors just proves that actors generally have very poor judgement and like the misquote of hitchcock are cattle this and the previously mentioned diseases other films are the absolute ultimate in pandering to the lowest common denominator of the hormonally challenged adolescent male mindset that hollywood seems to be pervertedly in love with film school critic retards included this is only my opinion but i know other cinema literate people who share it the fact that this was nominated for oscars is too abhorrent to bear add style and you can serve overrated place epithet here to the most pretentious pulp fiction has two things going for it sam jacksonrobbed at the oscars and christopher walkenwho has the films funniest sequence but thats all the tim roth amanda plummer scenes are irritating and too profaneswearings great but not like this the bruce willis gimp scene is memorable but a little sicko and the uma thurman sequenceyou know the one is absolutely unbearable she and travoltatoo fat to dance and never a terrific actor almost ruin this 1994 tarantino film single handedly but no it is tarantino himself that ruins the film everyone is nasty its excessive the way the three stories are told is confusing andthats about it some of it is funny and ving rhames is good as marsellus wallace but this is too much for me i know many like tarantino but i think hes a show off in the grand tradition of john wooone of his heroes apparentlybad bad bad it is such a shame that this movie is so bad it really has the potential to be great but no no no the first two movies were okay but this last one really sucked and yet everybody are joining this mass hysteria over this really really bad movie i just cant understand why a movie with really bad special effects and really bad acting bad directing but a great story can be the winner of 11 oscars the world has truly gone mad and to add it as the second best movie based on votes from users its sad just sad there are tons of movies that are better and this really is the movie that would never end very long ending 30 minutes of fading and ending only to not really end bearf i think people are mistaking the movie for the book sadwhen a prestige movie is made utmost attention is given to detail grandeur style and above all popularity godfather was a movie made to honor the great work of mario puzo who wrote a novel that brought true attention to the human side of the gangster mobster capolla knew that he had embarked on a great mission when he set out to perform the unthinkable to show the world that the leaders in crime have souls and that they are certainly not invincible this movie was what it was meant to be a prestige movie it took very few risks and was filmed to simply document the lives of its characters i found the godfather to be a very well done movie in fact i enjoyed this movie so much that i have watched it on many occasions this movie serves as a soap opera of the gangster world to me and it tells its story very well however i do not believe that any film of this character should be given such a high accord in the top 100 ranking the highest position on the rating scale should be given to a movie that fulfills the requirements of a movie to the tee the godfather does not do this as precisely as other movies people go to see movies simply to be displaced from their ordinary lives to be transported to another world life place or perspective the godfather does a very feeble attempt at fulfilling this essential requirement not at one moment in this movie does the audience become disconnected with themselves there is not a single instance where the actions on the screen become real and where the world in which the audience is watching from fades away to those of us who believe in the true excellence of movies the godfather does not rate anywhere near the `best movie of all time movies such as moulin rouge citizen kane requiem for a dream the matrix casablanca momento and even depending on the viewer gladiator all grasp the viewer by their hair and thrust them into another world if for only a few seconds the movie watching experience is topped by this disconnection from the real world it leaves us in a feeling of awe and shows us that the movie we just watched was more than just a movie but a journey into the minds of the characters on the screen and in some unique cases a journey into the great depths of our own minds with this sort of depth and greatness these types of movies should be all in the top 10 this unique greatness is not easily achieved in order to capture the audience in such a thrilling way a great deal of effort must be spend meticulously building up the pace and timing of the movie the climax should be the point where the viewer has already been captured into the movie and should thus create a `climatic experience thus blowing the viewer away the godfather has none of these elements perfected to such a state that they encapsulate the viewing public to a degree worthy of its ranking so it is therefore obvious that the godfather does not reach the greatness of a few other better movies and so it is not deserving of its top ranking if it were up to me i would move the godfather down to 5 or 6 and leave room the real screen gems to be appreciated this movie gets a rating of 9 out of 10wat the hell is good about this movie its too streched out silly stupid ending every second you think its going to end but noooooooooo one more scene to gotoo long for nothing 3 hours can be smidged into an hour and a halfthe pervious 2 are much betterthat film is sososososos overrated its patheticim sorry but i dont get it why is everybody so crazy about this movie is it because of the effects we have seen better even in old movies this one didnt impress me is it because of the story we have seen better the story and the characters in this movie seem to be taken from an old days disney fable ok is it because the actor who plays the joker died in real life after finishing it if thats the reason why is that exciting and anyway then it has nothing to do with cinema itself i admire the performance of the two main male actors both bale and ledger play very well indeed as usual but unfortunately their job cant compensate for the flat performances of their colleagues specially that of maggie gyllenhaal nor for the many deficiencies of the script the result is an unbalanced movie the interactions between the characters is awkward they move around in a world that doesnt seem to fit them a bit predictable a bit overloaded for a movie to be a classic it has to give you something it has to make you grow and it has to grow in you this movie is definitely not in this category this movie is seriously over hyped crap from a completely technical view it has some merits its well filmed the shots and cutting are phenomenal the plot has some merit although there was a whole of one thing i didnt see coming throughout the whole film the one scene i enjoyed is on the boats a deep look into humanitys fragile tempers christian bale is terrible in his role of batman his voice is so forced he makes it way too gravelly and just botches the whole thing he allows absolutely no subtlety and the love story angle is so contrived god he was terrible oooh now we get to the poster boy heath ledger ok i do have to grant that he did a fairly good job in his portrayal of the joker his lines are well delivered and his acting is good but this idea that he is now the holy grail of acting is just stupid he died so now everyone feels like they cant critique him when did death make you amazing fine then hitler was a saint cause he died we arent allowed to say he messed up ever he did a good job but there have been far better actors i feel the writing was almost as important to the character as his acting doesnt matter how good you act if the writing sucks the movie sucks on to a one aaron eckhart decent acting far better in thank you for smoking but thats besides the point i dont have much to say other than he started really strong and finished off pretty weak after one of the plot twists his acting just gets mediocre all in all this movie would have been really good i mean phenomenal if it werent for all of the hype around it i saw it in theaters a day or so after opening and enjoyed it until about the 4 millionth why so serious half an hour after it was over it was good but it belongs in maybe the low hundreds on the top 250 list not top 10 i really hate reviews where people write about how much they hate some movies but i found this movie so annoying that im really surprised why did people like it so ill just try to explain why i didnt like it 1this is the most boring movie i have ever seen i never liked batman movies but this is the worst one i watched it just because my friend told me it was good but i didnt enjoy it i nearly fell asleep 2 the movie doesnt have any sense its stupid i dont get the ideaits flat 3 the characters are so annoying there is no likable character in this movie all of them are boring i have to admit that heath ledger was great but there is nothing else i liked in this movie its just my opinion maybe i just didnt get somethingive seen a lot of movies in my days this one was fine but not the best a movie should keep you entertained not make you think  when is this going to end did not deserve to be n1 in imdb all that surrealism mostly boring in parts even disturbing maybe few of you will enjoy it but i think it would be better if there was more done in less time rather than the opposite the same old stuff happens like a soup opera you like it in the binging you say to your self  this will be good imdb was right but an hour later you think yeaah been there done that lets turn it off think about it was this the best youve ever seen no just read the title tough i think its a pretty decent movie but not as good as the stephen kings novel i just cant understand why it should deserve to be ahead of everyone else in the top 250 with the exception of the godfather to be honest i dont even really think it should be in the top 250 yeah i know you americans love the happy ending vaseline flavored subtly homosexual jail movies but all this hype its too much anyway come on this cant be better than welles kubrick kurosawa or scorsese or not even carpenter and fulci in my humble opinion so i give it a 1 10 this is not a critical valuation of the movie this is a political statementby far the most overrated movie in the history of movies whats even the point of making these types of movies when they are so unreal in a bad way is this movie about one guy who can allegedly kick ass we all know whats real and whats not wright and what probably would have happened to that kind of hero you just have to assume in fact this would have happened in real lifesnl digital short hero song overall the movie is very boring and confusing there is something far more entertaining and its thisdigital short batman snl  the dark knight is not a good movie by any measure i will now proceed to provide reasons for this statement in the process of which spoilers will abound in this film batman the batman as the characters refer to him possesses superpowers rivaled only by superman he bends gun barrels using his bare hand yes only one hand and falls from ridiculous heights not deploying his cape and lands without as much as a scratch to his body the batman is apparently not aware that it is not the fall that kills you it is the quick acceleration at the end and no matter the quality of the batsuit that acceleration cannot be reduced on the other hand his kevlar batsuit which evidently is impervious to bullets of small hand guns fired at close range is unable to withstand dog bites the joker whose obvious insanity is the only light of the movie is well played by ledger who flares with his eyes and mouth to give him an almost rabid portrayal but other than being a dark menace to society his odd manners and at one time drag outfit provide comedic relief in the film apart from being just a regular killing maniac he also possesses superpowers of his own in the film he is depicted with an apparent and sporadic invisibility to police forces that they do not notice his deformed face without make up in their own ranks during a salute may be pardonable but when blowing up an apparently unsurveilled hospital on prior warning and then leaving in full make up in a school bus his escape vehicle of choice also from bank raids his failed apprehension seems unpardonable unless of course all the cops had their lunch break as the sun indicates it is around noon the plot is so thin at times you expect it to crack at any moment it is like there are many small plots in all of which batman the purported main character plays but a small role whatever the joker has been doing all his life before going on a murder spree is pardonable to omit but when he breaks into bruce waynes penthouse probably using his cloaking capabilities the same locale that a few scenes later will be referred to as the safest place in town by the same person who was tossed out a window during this same brief encounter it is an interesting question just how the maniac and his armed gang are persuaded to leave the party full of gothams economic elite something they must have done without causing much further harm as it goes largely unnoticed by the other characters batman speaks with a deathly voice that is so ghoulish it could scare off any foe would he just make more use of it against his enemies and not blather like that to his friends that he finally tracks the joker down is not due to any superior detective skills as he gets good help from prying on all of gothams mobile phones that he immorally and secretly has replaced with his own brand all in one nights work more ridiculous plot element is hard to come by  it is a great pity that people cannot distinguish between great works of literature and the failure to exemplify these works in the cinema graphic medium these three films adapted from the great work were shot on low quality film and in a manner to make the greatest profit from as much exploitation of its artisans as possible for example peter jackson knew that he could new zealand citizens to be extras at no costs due to the novelty of under taking such a project of this magnitude and glamor in a parochial isolated hometown new zealand countryside peter jackson fran walsh and philipa boynes bought the film rights of the great literature for a massive cost and then hired scriptwriters to prepare the screenplay adaptation in their names at great cost this was a very poor screenplay if you really loved the books and actually read them which most of the films audience probably never could or did how the motion picture academy members voted it best screenplay adaption and gave the award to these three people is rather suspicious the cinematography was very poor with many shots out of focus and overuse of various camera techniques this has been supported many cinematographers in many blogs the acting performances were very mediocre and the selection of actors was purposefully chosen from australians and new zealanders due to peter jacksons view that they are better actors than americans and the british in fact australians and new zealanders have this strange dislike americans despite consuming their films the animations of various creatures was so similar to the vampires in dusk till dawn it makes you wonder if the cgi people had much imagination the many gratuitously violent scenes not described as such in the books would have been very frightening to children let alone the ridiculous characterization of the golum in fact most of the cgi was carried out by americans hired by peter jacksons multi million dollar cgi suite which at the end of the day makes you wonder where mr peter jackson got the money to not only buy the film rights to the books but to build a multi million dollar film effects studio in new zealand the whole thing was obviously a massive profit making exercise in profit making with peter jackson and his mates securing huge merchandising deals in the planning of the projectit is further proof that the very wealthy and privileged can always demonstrate what their money can achieve not what they themselves can achieve due to any talent or real imagination it was not made for the sake of love of a great work of literature but for profit and self aggrandizement i fully understand that films must make profit but this one really couldnt go wrong with the material and the present day innovations in cgi i am certain that one day someone will remake it and do it properly and maybe some one like john boorman who was originally going to make the film i am so content in thought that there is a great difference between people like myself and the people who glorify this film and peter jackson why does everyone like this movie its not particularly that good and everything in it is just so so wrong its ok for the government and the people in charge to lie to the masses the masses thats you are too stupid to rule themselves its ok to use peoples private cell phone info oh just this one time morgan freeman says thanks this is a fascist film it is fascist propaganda wake up people you should be outraged the movie is tell the audience you are idiots and look how easily we control you and make you think this is some great movie and look how much money we can make off your desperate desires thank god obama became president this movie seemed to be financed by the bush administrative prepping people for more bs who is this batman oh so troubled batman hes a rich white boy with guilt he doesnt want to play along so he goes out and inflicts the masses with his own morals which turns out to be exactly the same as his fellow rich white boys that rule poor little rich white boy this is a scary scary propaganda movie ten years from now well look back at this in horrorim sorry but im not being paid to write these reviews and it sure looks like those ahead of me are did we see the same picture i thought it was too long confusing poor plot line very very dark a lot of gratuitous violence and ledgers performance was just not oscar material as so many are proclaiming during the movie several people got up and left there were a couple of times there my date and i thought about leaving but we paid premium bucks to see the thing and you hate wasting money like that the film gets off to a pretty good start we were all excited but as it went along it began to drag ledger looks awful and they relied enitrely on makeup with no prosthetics they way they did with nicholson to give you the impression of a smiling joker here it was just white and red makeup piled on the way a six year old might do after getting into mommys makeup and dark everything was so dark throughout the film that each time someone opened a flip phone it was as bright as a flashlight i thought surely they arent going to call anyone but because so many were doing it i figured they were looking at the time a sure sign that the film was lumbering along from this viewers perspective i thought it was awfulthis movie was disgusting and the language was deplorable it didnt make a lot of sence as they were constantly jumping from one scene to another it was like multiple perverted cartoons put on one movie if i had known what it was going to such a nasty perverted movie i would have never even touched the movie if you are thinking of watching this movie do not watch this movie it is a waste of time it is a lot of trash also remember what you put in your mind comes out in your actions could someone please tell me why this movie is so damned popular people say that i simply dont understand it i admit it no i simply cant see anything interesting in this piece of just like the other movies of tarantino and my own fellow country man lars von trier who has also been so over praised by the critics i would like to say that i do find difficult films like the films of kieslowski fassbinder etc interesting these films are about real characters and not some overestimated roles well we all have different tastes including films but until this moment no one has ever been able to argue why pulp fiction is his her personal favourite movie of all time they always just say that this movie is so cool exciting interesting etc to say that this movie is overblown pap is an understatement like its predecessors this flick employs just about every movie clichÜ© in cinema history like long long death scenes fake death scenes how many times did freddo die only to our surprise hes really not dead at all  a mans gotta do what a mans gotta do scenes in fact what with the clip clop galloping of horses everywhere i thought it had strayed into a western ride like the wind type comments abound the mad bad king who dies a horrible death coz hes so mad and bad the cute little hobbits were all supposed to cheer for and even a darth vader type chief villaincoupled with a script that was so lame the better actors were really pushing themselves to the limit trying to make the lines sound at least half original in fact the only interesting characters in this enermous exercise in money grabbing movie cynicism were the villains the orcs at least had character not surprising then that the movie relies upon the gollum to sell it in years to come this lumbering saga of over hyped over produced trash will be not be regarded in the same way star wars is but in the same way titanic is bit of an embarrassment the godfather is elevated pants its considered a classic because it was cynically designed to be a classic it knows the the secrets of tension and payoff it hooks the idiots with some random moaning broad getting boned in the first few minutes and enough money was pumped into it that it looks like a painting in motion you got breasts and glamourized gangster machismo for the men and scenic rural italy for the women it would be obvious how paper thin and sadly calculated it all really is if the performances didnt propel it into something approaching three dimensionality i prefer goodfellas because it deconstructs everything the godfather is about and is a much more natural intuitive film in the process it seems to be the fashion among film intelligentsia to give wild praise to the most incomprehensible and incoherent rubbish sending the partly unspoken message that if you the film goer do not get it you are not smart enough to understand it this applies to most of the oeuvre of the late stanley kubrick with the exception of lolita dr strangelove and to a point a clockwork orange and it applies equally well to this odd and trashy bit of nonsense handed to us by quentin tarantino to say that sitting through it was painful would be an understatement but if that isnt bad enough it is also incoherent and confusing at one point the samuel l jackson character dies if memory serves only to show up alive later with no explanation given uma thurman is striking to look at in that dark wig and travolta stretches what little acting talent he has but i still to this day have no idea what the movie was about and frankly tarantino failed to make me care very much like most of kubricks work this film is visually striking the color palette in particular is stunning but at the end of the day how a film looks means nothing unless there is some substance underneath the surface and if there is any here i did not see it at the time this movie came out the critics were falling all over themselves proclaiming that it represented a new direction for hollywood films fortunately that seems not to have been the case really this movie is wrong in every way it is an example of how not to tell a superhero movie placing it in reality is ok but then you are bound to the rules of reality and this movies applies superhero rules in realityjumping on a car in the car park without breaking legs and it also defies logichenchmen who keep getting killed and still there is an ample supply of to fill the ranksthese guys must be dumb a villain who act contrary to what he proclaims he isnt funnyhe is not chaos he acts to much like like an einstein for that needless sidetracks that lead to nothingthe whole bullet set up the philosophy 101 scenes that interrupt the flow of the movie just to make a point is so lame the totally wooden acting from everyone except ledger and oldmanas if they edited all the worst takes of the other actors to give ledgers performance some shine setting is not gothic it is dark techno punk or tech noir the city doesnt look like the city in batman beginswhich was a great film this part is not needed if you look at the three movies because it has nothing to do with the story line of batman begins and the dark knight rises dent was not in bb and tdkr and two face was killed in this movie and rachel whose part had a different actress than bb is killed of and for the plot of tdkr rachel is only needed to be reminded that she is dead and would not have waited for bruce even the jokers performance isnt that great either but it stands out because all the other acting is wooden i can continue about more things that annoy me about the dark knight but then i can write a page full of thingswhat surprised me what rating this got and that is too much for such a bad movies that tries to be two movies at once but fails at both of them and the raspy voice and way to prominent soundtrack i love the fact that the movie give us an insight in something we would as normal people never get the chance to know its a world full of traditions family values rich and explicit verbal and behavior language but also a world of corruption power deceit and murder francis ford coppola knows how to create this italian american feeling throughout the whole movie and it never feels superficial its a very good movie but not extra ordinary i lack a bit of depth in the storyline like in the approach of the young son michael being dragged into the world of the mafia it was a bit too easy he gets smacked in the face by a corrupt cop and suddenly he wants to shoot everybody i think i miss an essential scene between him and his father in the clinic anyway trying to keep the godfather on number feels a bit compulsory and bizarre i think that this great movie needs to get away from this forced spotlight position so we can appreciate the film without all this hype and we shouldnt be blind to other great cinematic pearls being made in recent years this film is very stereotypical and as i am half italian i feel i have the right to stick up for the crowds of real italians who find this film totally offensive and even boring this kind of film can lead to racist attitudes in our society as its portrayal of normal folk is completely over the top ott marlon brando received many praises for his performance but there are too many inaccuracies too mention in his accent never mind his mannerisms i watched this film with my friend his italian wife and her parents who dont speak english and get this they fell asleep the greatest movie of all time and they fell asleep i managed to stay awake but it was hard but my friend loved it for some weird reason but hes an oddball so he doesnt count certainly does not deserve to be numero one instead may i suggest the princess bride a classic tale of love and adventure ok ill admit i liked the godfather but #1 movie of all time that is sickening a good movie is not a movie that is fun if it was then #1 would be a bad james bond movie any movie that is close to the top 10 should be a movie that gives you meaning outside of the theater not a movie about false organized crime how the hell did this movie get #1 if its just a movie about killing the only movie i can think of that should get #1 is american beauty in the movie there was more talking then fighting and harveys killing spree wasnt all that good threatening to kill a child is one thing but holding a gun and falling off a roof with batman why not just shoot the damn thing the family live whoop dee doo but batman just leaving the joker dangling up there like a puppet wasnt all that great yes the jokes & sarcasm were hilarious but the entertainment was awful its rated pg 13 for intense sequences of violence and some menace the sequences were not intense and were most definitely not violent when we see marvel and movies based on old characters we expect power fighting and conflicts but in this movie wheres the power fighting conflitcs nowhere to be found so the joker got arrested yippee he escaped and only took one life the scenes with those 2 boats were really unnecessary having a ferry full of civilians and another full of criminals and both with a remote to blow the other up and are threatened to blow up at midnight midnight comes and everyone is still alive and none of the ferries were blown big whoop all in all the movie sucked id advise all you people who loved batman when they were kids to not see this moviewell the praise for this movie must be due to heath ledgers death or at least i hope thats the reason because the movie is pretty disappointing ledger is a convincing maniac but the rest of the cast falls short is christian bale in this movie i think he gets the least screen time of the three leads ledger eckhart included and really doesnt get many good lines the only scenes i enjoyed were between he and ledger the editing of this film reflects the jokers theme chaoswas that intentional if so a poor choice after the wonderful simplicity of many superhero films including batman begins id give that a 9 10 dark knight may have not been edited at all it seems thrown together with no accounting for the viewers intelligence ive seen better episodes of televisionthis movie had too much action for me unlike everybody else in the world nowadays i dont care for action movies i lost interest about halfway through the film maybe when youve actually seen lots of blood and gore in the real world it spoils action packed movies for you it seems to have done so for me this film does have more characterization and plot development than most action movies i think thats why its been so highly rated i found the plot puerile however i will say this for the dark knightthough it is probably one of the most cerebral action movies to date unfortunately cloaking a comic book in realism cant hide its true colors instead of questioning capitalism communism taoism or existentialism and challenging the audience it is about corruption and surrendering to corruption like surrendering to jaded teen boredom fueled by the claustrophobic helplessness due to terrorism and the merciless acceptance of hipster nihilism tdk is a cold unrealistic mechanical set up sold over and over again by its proponents as ultra realistic that is the most frightening thing about the obsessive if not immoral blatherings of tdk fans is the emperors new clothes insistence that the film represents realism from the jokers precision timing to drive a school bus into a line of school buses with one space left for him to dents facial damage due to 5 seconds of burning gasoline the film is rife with movie fakeness sold like ad or add pitchmen for nolans formulaic realism which is actually just him stealing from the long halloween a meaningless rube goldberg contraption nolan takes the audience on an endless set of fake out twists and turns to deliver very little but loud moments as calculated and obsessive as the joker is and to the degree he plans about 5 separate back up plans that come to fruition he enters the level of anal retentive yet somehow we are to believe he is some agent of chaos which means cool chaos = cool get it theres nothing cool or chaotic about this drugged out riffing joker and as fun as ledger makes him he overshadows what should have been the center of the story harvey dent but its batman so business as usual problem child villain acts up makes a mess batdad shows up to clean up the mess crowd applauds unfortunately what the film creates is a subtext of a neocon wetdream with by any means necessary militarism where the batman uses unethical means to detect the joker and we are to assume this fall from grace makes him heroic because he is banished and falsely accused for 1 minute of nagging by the joker turning dent evil for yet another film coincidence of driving dent from white to dark knight so batman takes the blame and is the dark knight cuz hes just a christ figure so our sacrificial justice league hero is supposed to be a sympathetic figure of crossing moral boundaries to save society george bush must have loved this puppy not sure half the tween tards watching this caught that bit of hooey but as much as the poster art evokes fight club this film is about as far from punk anarchy as you can get maybe they should all be sent to military school if this is their idea of rebellion i just rented this from netflix and forced myself to watch it till the end what a dreadful boring yet expensive movie it was so dimly lit they could have had any of the thousands of out of work actors in southern california in it with no perceptible difference i guess a couple more explosions would have helped not really i only watched it cause of heath ledgers excellent performance in brokeback mountain boy was i disappointed i didnt care about anyone while watching except for myself who was waiting for it to end at times the dialog was difficult to understand with the volume way up but the loud soundtrack made every sound effect rattle the furniture i just dont get what passes for great entertainment nowadays i had to watch some old rocky and bullwinkle cartoons afterward as an intelligent antidote to this cartoonish movie that tries for so much significance an odd combination its like looking for significance and the meaning of life in an infomercial dont botherall i think i need to say is this was a good film but needs to be out of the top 100 movies of all time its not that good its just a batman film and thats all it will ever be ok it may be the best batman film made but thats not hard to do was it people need to really think before they vote and not give it ten out of ten just because the joker is now dead i would have really given it an 7 10 but gave it a 1 10 because it needs to get out of the top 100 but all in all its worth a look 7 10 vote the film not the actorthis movie is ranked as the 4th best on imdb that pisses me off because so many people think imdb top 250 is the definitive list it is not in fact it is not much different from all the other voting lists done by the public and people who put this in there top 10 you will find have not seen many of the classics or dont like them cos they are stupid or just in there teens or both like i am but i know movies now just know this is not a top 10 if anything it is at the bottom off a top 100 list im not saying this cant be in your top 10 favorite movies it can it can be number 1 if you want but dont say it is one of the top 10 best movies ever because it is not the same with a lot of other top 250 films shawshank is not the best film off all time i will give you my list of my 10 favorite films off all time 1 the godfather 2 pulp fiction 3 raging bull 4 apocalypse now 5 the good the bad and the ugly 6 a clockwork orange 7 2001 8 life of brian 9 taxi driver 10 one flew over the cuckoos nest only 2 maybe 3 of them are top 10 material and those are the godfather raging bull and maybe 2001 but i can admit that those others are not as high as i would place them all you dark knight fan boys should start like a lot of the other overrated movies on the list it is still great but it doesnt deserve to be so high for better lists of best movies off all time look at afi 100 years 100 movies and sight & sounds pollhow many times does a crook have to be caught and released over several boring hours to make a movie feel dynamic spoilers if joker has so few people in his gang especially if he goes around killing them on a regular basis how does he get the large set pieces sorted out exploding buildings and boats etc yes it was fantasy that much is clear but rushing from set piece to set piece drama tension explosion is poor production technique but a 91 rating over 270000 voters this will be a lone voice probably in the love fest that has occurred around this title please no oscar nominations glad i got that off my chesti am deeply shockedäó_ i am really shocked that this film made it all the way to the top its ok with me that it is a huge success at the box office i can cope with it that many many people do not have the same taste as me even though it is a little sad because i think this somewhat strange taste of the comic buffs will influence the movies in the future even more there are interesting articles about the influence of the bloggers and hardcore fans on producers and directors what really shocks me here is that many many acclaimed critics fail to see how bad this movie is they write about hidden stories meanings and messages the war in iraq the war against terrorism a reflection of american society and so on they write about hilarious performances of the actors they write about stunning visual effects some of them may even write about the tremendous script fortunately so far i did not read anything about the scriptwriting so i try to begin with that issue well the script is so down down deep down below that i dont even know where i shall begin i guess the guys who are more in the comic stuff will tell you that jonathan nolan really did a good job in adopting the stories and the mood of the comic books but for me this is no reason to write a story that lacks everything and is so brain dead that im gasping for air the plot is annoying and predictable the characters are written really poorly first of all harvey dent his turning into a fallen angel is so incredibly incredible it may result from the way that the brains of the comic buffs work 9 pictures or less per page i that time you can turn from a white hero into a black devil but this is a movie and no 9c trash book to say it clear äóñ and you may have noticed äóñ i am no comic fan but i like for instance sin city very much it is a very good adaptation into a now medium and it is visually very interesting visuals as i said sin city is visually very interesting the dark knight is not totally not almost two decades before we saw terminatorii oh my god this was something new and two face äóñ aaron eckhart looked a little like the wrecked arni back then dont get me wrong the make up apartment did a very good job it is just so sad that we already saw it all before just like the inspection of the new weaponsäó_ is this a scene of one of the bond movies or take the matrix part1 about one decade before visually the dark knight is not one tick better or more interesting maybe on the same level sin city was something new the dark knight shows us common techniques in a slightly higher perfection the directing is average not outstanding it must have been a logistic masterpiece ok but we have seen it before the acting i cant even say if the actors are bad i think it is the story that is so poor the joker is good heath ledger is good not brilliant or something like that it is solid work and he is the only character that is somewhat interesting and not full of pathetic crap well to draw the conclusion again i can live with it that this movie is that successful at the box office i can not live with the super high praising comments of professional critics for action entertainment this movie is too long at least one hour is simply annoying again the writing so who ever has some bucks left go see this movie and see what brain damaged meansby far the most overrated hunk of junk i have ever viewed who the heck thinks this is a good movie its just another in a long line of stupid super hero comic book movies that have come out to the theater in the past few years the acting is terrible from batman himself who i couldnt understand half the things he was saying to the very barely average performance of ledger they consider his role oscar material youve got to be kidding you want to see a good performance go rent monsters ball even the patriot he was better the special affects are nothing to go crazy about just your typical cgi thats not so spectacular nowadays and that plot like that made allot of sense but i guess like adam sandler movies people like this garbage to think this movie is getting higher ratings than the godfather movies shawshank pulp fiction schindler list star wars and casablanca shows you the mentality of todays movie vieweri give it one star because of the headache inducing over storyboarded and dull midsection a botched directorial effort by nolan 1 mid point scenes of harvey dent character w maggie gyllenhall scenes of commissioner gordon & cops etc slowed movie down drudgingly with boring back story needed 20 minutes shaved off 2 batman fight scenes had elbow jabs galore and looked like a blur 3 choppy story editing in first half of movie swung from action scenes to modern high rise scenes back and forth like a yo yo felt like i was going up and down an express elevator gave me a headache 4 not enough joker in first half see first aspect 5 two face shouldve lived but the special fx on him were overkill 6 the mayor played by a too young and effeminate looking actor with obvious mascara looked ridiculousfirst of all tdk surely surpassed every hype made before an amazing acting of a crew assembled beautiful direction made this movie memorable i stunned to watch the scene in which batman was flying with wing after jumping from that amazing designed building it had never been used such beautiful scene before the whole movie was full of thrills and overall impact was so laud but the trump card of this movie is the card of joker a joker usually comes in movie or drama to put an element of entertainment in itbut many time many director use it to express some complex thing because common audience can also understand the language of a joker i remembered very well about my childhood that i could understand only part of the joker in drama which i saw then hence v for vendetta or or others of same type movies put their things beautifully in front of common of common audience the joker of tdk have also to say something to this common people but he show his dark sidethe character of joker in tdk is the best of all time jokerheath leather we will miss you nolan is a great geniusthis is the 3rd best film on imdb just came out of the cinema and couldnt believe my eyes what a waste of time money & human creativity this is so far the worst film ive seen this year & easily the worst film christopher nolan has directed why do great actors like christian bale heath ledger and michael caine accept such roles äóî are they in it just for the money thats totally okay but then they should refrain from jazzing up this piece of crap and just say what it is äóî a shallow pathetic off the rack exploitation movie for brain damaged teens i had a hard time piecing that pseudo heroic dialogue together äóî at times it seemed to come straight out of fortune cookies at times i didnt even know what the hl the people on screen were talking about never mind the totally unimaginative camera storytelling action scenes everything everything was just so seen before laughable enough said voted 1 out of 10 just for the ok & above average acting of heath ledgerthis is one of the most over rated pieces of $hit ive ever had the misfortune of watching went to the cinema to see this when it came out and was bored $hitless only now do i have the patience and calm to write a review well done to the makers of the movie for exploiting heath ledgers death to the maximum to push this movies appeal to the general public christopher nolan is a hack director in my opinion scene upon pointless scene of boring tedious dialogue scenes that drag and drag going nowhere christian bale was utterly dire as batman not only was the voice he put on absurd but he just doesnt suit batman end of story heath ledger while a competent actor was nothing special as the joker yet again another over rated aspect of this movie his performance it was mediocre the plot is ludicrous with the joker planting bombs without getting caught etc thats another thing id like to mention chris nolan tapped into a bit of terrorism here9 11 anyone dont tell me none of you noticed this what a total cop out lets get the american viewers attention by throwing in a bit of 9 11 themed stuff after the film ended i was really angry that i had been charged an extortionate amount of my hard earned money to watch this garbage what was worse was having to read and hear about the raving reviews of this total mess of a film to hell with all the fan boys who will defend this plastic pretentious charade at all costs who gives a flying phuck how much money it made it was utter $hit the star wars movies were the worst movies of all time science fiction by itself is bad enough let alone being a cult like nerd flick the music was the best thing and even that was melodramatic at times and come on whats the whole long time ago thing if we dont have flying machines now we most certainly didnt have them in the past ok so maybe the star wars movies dont belong on the bottom 100 but in the top ten is ridiculous what a protagonist i say as the great mavoric murdock said only the best will be the worst the irony in this comment is astounding for you see if the public does not recount the degeneracy who will let me explain for every brilliant movie made there are many more hidieous movies so then if there are an abundance of awful movies then mediocre ones will seem fantastic and good ones will seem godly for example the godfather my point is that the praise of star wars is merely a product of being surrounded by worse movies  all of the lord of the rings movie are overrated but thats just my opinion they are not good enough to even be on the top 250 how could this be number 3 or did u just say hmm this movie won an academy award umm it must be good its not all it was was action and boringness now i dont necessarily hate these movies but definantly overrated i mean not even being worthy of an academy award or being on the top 250 i mean come on people ive seen people with good movie taste say these were good in my opinion the 2nd one was the best and the others were hardly okay for me and i did not like the 3rd and was very angry wen i saw it under godfather and the shawshank redemption i mean jeez now this is only my opinion but i know several people who agree with me now this is just my opinion so dont get all offended  i watched the fellowship & could live with the changes the two towers made my heart sink too many alterations & additions yes additions i can understand cutting the story to fit but shovelling lumps of extraneous storyline in that is not in the book why extra elves at helms deep wtf why cut bits that those familiar with the books are expecting to add garbage that no one expects i cant explain the return of the king was for me the last straw the return of jacksons ego more like why they saw fit to change dialogue from the original in some cases only a few words & in others changing the speaker of the words this is peter jacksons lotr not tolkeins i havent checked but the credits should show inspired by jrr tolkein because this is not his work i will stick with the bbc 4 version which while abridged is true to tolkein & the pictures are better on radio as god as my witness as god as my witness theyre not going to lick me im going to live through this and when its all over ill never be hungry again nor any of my folk if i have to lie steal cheat or kill as god as my witness ill never be hungry again this is what i was fully expecting to come pouring from sams mouth as he and frodo were collapsing for what seemed like the 200th time on the way to get rid of the ring or was that the heart of the ocean from some of the music and the similarity in the scenes between throwing the ring into the fire and heart of the ocean into the sea i wasnt sure i didnt know if i was watching gone with the wind titanic or some hobbit movie and if they had cut about an hour of elijah woods pained and soulful looks into the distance and the eyes of his friends they could have made the movie a manageable length just a wee bit too much drama what a disappointmentpulp fiction in my opinion is the most overrated movie of all time i really dont understand why many people claim it to be one of the greatest movies ever its cruel stupid idiotic its full of violence & f words to the point that its sickening its like lets get a couple of guns a couple of f words a couple of murders and lets combine them to make a movie i hated everything about it everything to me all the positive comments on this site about this movie are written by only 1 fan under different usernames so the scenes were not in chronological order big deal that doesnt make it a masterpiece this is hollywood garbage there are some scenes that are sick the movie is sick this is my review i gave it a 2 10 just because the actors are respected everything else is idioticrotk is one of the most hyped movies of all time i think that it is also the most personally disappointing movie i have ever watched i was so excited to see this film i was left with a bitter taste in my mouth the first blow came when instead of showing the white wizard sauromans demise we open the film with something from the hobbitgollums backstory this made me mad because i was told that sauroman was cut because they didnt want to dwell on two towers apparently they didnt mind dwelling on the hobbit so what you have in return of the king is a villianous army with no general no main villian save for sauron who is only in the film as a spirit only what you have as the main villian is a bunch of stunt guys in very good costumes the action is fine in the film but aragorn just doesnt sell his part well imho his leaving to find the ghost army is waaaaaaay understated legolas and gimli are made into nothing more than his stooges who look assuringly at him whenever he has doubt frodo sam gollum on the other hand give great performances and are the only bright spot of the film although i think sheloub was a huge disappointment and did not live up to the hype preceding the film the ghost army looks like scooby doo animators drew it and the action scenes involving them are all wide sky shots where you cant see what is going on the multiple endings are also a plod along as the movie stops starts stops starts and finally comes to a end long after i was ready to leave the movie just overall disappointed me greatlyhow long was this awful film almost 4 hours the last 30 minutes were really taking the mickey in no uncertain terms the ring gets destroyed thats it movie over we really dont need to see sam & frodo get saved by eagles or them return to hobbiton or see bilbo & frodo leave with the elves does that even happen in the book the end of the film drags on far too long also the build up to the 2 main big battles drags on far too long as well if you are going to adapt a very long novel learn from frank herberts dune which originally was 8 hours long when dino delaurentis shot it dont botheri saw this movie when it first came out in the movie theaters it was the first movie i seriously considered walking out of up to that point in my life i had never fidgeted so much in a movie i blame the director his pacing was so ponderous that the story seemed to go on and on and i could hardly wait for it to be over the whole godfather series is vastly overratedafter hearing about this legendary film i decided it was about time i watched itafter about an hour i really wished i hadnt wasted the money renting itafter the movie finished i was bored the film was nothing like i had expected and i dont know how it possibly made it as big as it has it was quite well cast i love diane keaton but shes better in woody allens comedys than in this derivitive movie you want a good gangster moviewatch goodfellasit actually has a good story entertaining characters & violence and paints a much more realistic picture of the mob world of the era im not even going to bother watching parts 2 or 3 of the godfather coz marlon brando aint even in them so their aint much point i think ill go watch marlon brandos greatest performanceguys n dollsif i could give this film a negative 10 it would not begin to describe how horrible it is there is little to no plot the story never resolves and it jumps around in time and sequence so much that it is impossible to make any sense out of it i fail to see why so many people actually like this film and why it continues to get great reviews the only thing this film offers is a lot of graphic violence and blood throughout the entire movie the only thing that quentin tarantino is good for when you finally do reach the end you find yourself wondering why in the world you just wasted so much time time that could have been better spent cleaning your sock draweri saw rotk yesterday and its undoubtly the best lotr movie peter jackson is a genius and i really hope he wins an academy award for best director as always some goofs can be found but who cares the patient waiting is over because this great movie has finally been released and now some words about the actors elijah wood frodo played his part tremendously well but one cant really call him the star of this movie even though he carries the ring which he eventually destroys sean astin samwise played a much interesting character and i hope he gets nominated for his role merry and pippin played by dom monaghan and billy boyd are also two very funny characters they have a very strong friendship and dom & billy really show that on screen my guess is that it will be lotr time at the 76th academy awards in march 2004 after having seen how pulp fiction has infiltrated its way into current pop culutre the dance contest royale with cheese etc i finally got a chance to see the movie from the beginning and couldnt believe what a huge letdown it was there was nothing for me to grasp to make me care about what the characters were doing and why they were doing it and the overly gratuitous use of the f bombs put me off completely its almost as if swearing was substituted for wit and clever dialogue i felt like tarantino was trying to impress me with how much of a movie geek he is but if he tried to make a movie with an engaging story i might have liked it more the only person hes impressing is himself and it isnt working i could not maintain concentration throughout that film when i heard it was on i had high expectations but i was throughly disappointed with how boring it was i cant see how it was so good its just a load of italians in america killing others so boring i decided not to watch the last hour i will admit that the scene where the police captain and the drug guy was shot was quite good the uncertainty of whether the gun is there or not is well produced and the effect with the white noise sounding like blood rushing through your ears was much more effective than the lame heart beats that you get it some filmsthis movie is junk ive watched it twice i honestly dont see what people see in this garbage acting okay storyline garbage and predictable ive seen this exact movie in 3 other totally different movies its not original its an overrated thing just like breaking bad game of thrones the kardashians and celebrity babies this is garbage at its stinkys pulp fiction pulp reality dont judge something on what other people think at the end of the day watch itread itplay itbuy it you have the power dont listen to me watch it you can be the judge the movie isnt my favorite it sure isnt the worse its definitely not the best its overrated and transformers is betterstupid movie already slightly better than the first 2 installations at least we did not sleep for more than an hour during the show and caught the ending whats the fuss about these movies spectacular views well why not take a tour in australia and experience the views first handlets value it entertainment the script is more than clichÜ© typical prison break escape movie morgan freeman is ok tim robins is so awful in every scene he looks like he is crying production value is so so rating 3 10 social message the message of the movie is life is good society is fair enoughwhen it is unfairdont worry look at the down syndrome looking guy andywith a probably below average intelligence easily escaped the prison when you get caught do the samethe world is so wonderful and hopefuland american jails have better life than many other poor countries free lifetry a littleyou can do anythingthe message is complete wrong rating 5 10 objectionable things generally nothing serious objectionable to me but its a bit black supremacist it promotes typical black saintmagic negro image tells you blacks are morally superior than other people it violates my principal that people are equal rating 5 10 so overall rating 1 10the movie is as bad if aleksandr nevsky directed it it would be very very wonderful your tarantino is no talent he is in a shadow of aleksandr nevsky his movies are not badass nor funny aleksnadr nevskys movies are actiony good sotry and good jokes the movie has not script it was directed on the go tarantino no scirpt means bad business i thought the movie is gonna be as beautiful as treasure hunters by aleksandr nevksy but it is no no no no just very really no avoid your spending time of life on this garbage go and watch aleksandr nevskys movies they are very underrated pulp fiction is overrated because tarantino is no aleksandr nevsky i know good you know badok first of all i saw this a little while ago and i dont see how anybody could like this film except for the stars john travolta samuel l jackson uma thurman peter greene bruce willis and ving rhames the plot is all messed around and unorganized making it very difficult to understand the characters are all technically bad guys like i said the only good thing this film has to offer is the acting overall the film makes very little sense the way it is told the characters are all unlikable i really believe that if any film should get rated way lower than a 0 out of ten this is it i mean just how it got as high as an 89 out of 10 is beyond me id continue on ranting about how bad the story is written but this film just isnt worth anymore time please if youre wanting to see a great crime film go watch goodfellas1990 and if you want to go see a good action film go watch the hunted2003 this film rated from me is only a 1 out of 10 since it did have many famous and good actors but mars attacks is way better and that was a comedy filmbefore ram gopal verma conquered the gangster genre with satya and companybefore mahesh manjrekhars vaastav there was the ultimate gangster moviequentin tarantinos pulp fiction unfortunately whilst parinda was a hit satya and vaastav were even bigger hits and pulp fiction got almost forgotten tarantino had made one or two offbeat movie before this but he really hit it big time with pulp fiction it was released in 1994 to moderate success what really works for this movie is its restrained style most bollywood gangster movies i have seen are light on content and high on action pulp fiction doesnt have many overly long drawn out action sequences but what it offers is a great story and subtlety pulp fiction tells the story of four friendsjohn travolta his elder samuel l jackson harvey keitel and harvey willis this movie was the turning point in the fanciful world of hollywood which had so far kept the remotest possible distance from reality in order to provide a fantasy escape to people amidst poverty and underdevelopment hollywood in this respect had always feared compromising with colors glycerin scenic places superman feats dances and pomp and pageantry lest the movies would become insipid and turn off the masses coincidentally rd burmans last score before his demise was on tarantinos next venture er tv series pulp fiction is the best gangster movie to come out of bollywood or hollywood and deserves more appreciation from lovers of indian cinema highly recommended by methe third lord of the rings movie was absolutely painful to watch even worse than the second one it had me cringing and groaning all the way through and not because of any empathy for the characters but simply because the acting the scripting and the everything was so so so so stupid and that is quite the word i was looking for beauty and the beast arwen makes me so mad for appearing at all the wrong times and far too frequently its all very well to say directors privilege to change parts of the novel and all right im fine with that privilege but it can be taken too far arwen only appears twice throughout the books and her character is only established in the appendix j r r tolkien is most likely turning in his grave or at least frowning furiously from afar as he watches these mutilations of his wonderful trilogy and when denethor jumped off the pyre i almost died laughing and i dont think that was the reaction peter jackson was aiming for ah well disappointment comes in all shapes and sizes and the biggest disappointment of my life came in the form of a movie called the return of the king  if there was a zero out of 10 thats what id give it i know so many people hear the movie title the godfather and automatically feel like praising that movie that whole trilogy to the high heavens well i dont care if it was made wellapart from how it was made the movie was bad and im still upset that my philosophy teacher made me suffer through the whole trilogy boringslowjust plain snooze ville im probably going to have an angry mob coming after me for speaking of the movie this way but its my opinionand im sure im not alone in feeling this way  firstly i wish to say that i think the dark knight is a very good movie as an average batman fan i think that this version of the batman chronicles balances artful pathos with run of the mill mainstream icons and themes secondly my goal is to make a brief point that this film has no place in the top 10 movies of all time thirdly and lastly in order to make my point i would like you to review the top 10 list below 1 the shawshank redemption 1994 455891 2 91 the godfather 1972372101 3 90 the godfather part ii 1974 218313 4 89 il buonoil brutto il cattivo 1966 137484 5 89 pulp fiction 1994372926 6 88 schindlers list 1993 247064 7 88 one flew over the cuckoos nest 1975 190056 8 88 12 angry men 1957 100190 9 88 the dark knight 2008 403372 10 88 star wars episode v the empire strikes back 1980 now ask yourself the question does the dark knight belong in this list i do not think it does my opinion i do not think that the the dark knight meets the basic criteria of character development and story plot dialog quality it is a 2 dimensional action film that wants to nick the surface of character development but fails to meet the challenge the worst film i have seen this year its so boring i think it got good reviews because heath ledger died and that was a tribute to him batman is crap the joker is average the first batman with jack nicholas as the joker is 1000 times better that was excellent this was dire and boring beware batman fans are just going over the top for this heap of rubbish the film is so predictable because you know what happens i think that gadgets were not that good and the actors were not that good i was expecting this to be great but as with all films with far too much hype i was waiting for the good bit after an hour i was still waiting after 2 i thought this is so dull and it wasnt going anywhere i love good films eg iron man lord of rings indianna jones shawshank redemption star wars this is a classic by no means this movie was trying to be many things at once between the cheesy gordons lines and a gangster movie wannabe they really lost a lot of the essence they build in the first movie first of all batman is supposed to be a superhero in my opinion they should have focused in getting a mix of spiderman which made superheroes movies popular again with the kind of asian mystery and wise character they created in the first movie now you just see a guy that can do no wrong where you are supposed to be awed by his sacrifices see the problem is that if you want to create a believable gangster movie good guys have legitimate reasons to kill bad guys sometimes and they pretty much have to unless they are a priest or something remember the departed thats what you have to focus on if you want good drama they could complement that with what the new hulk movie the one with edward norton achieved and then we could have a fantastic movies with one of the greatest comic characters of all time as far as the acting goes i dont see what all the fuzz is all about with the joker watch no country for old men and tell me who you are really scared of afterwards and no makeup required on top of that wow i love this movie to date i have probably watched it nearly 40 times i am not obsessive whenever it is on i watch it for most movies at least the dramatic ones i measure them based on how they make me feel this one makes me feel sad when brooks dies angry when tommy dies and happy when red finds his friend this movie makes me feel good i know that is not very scientific but its the truth because of the way it plays on me i cant help but give it a 10 heres why first off the acting tim robbins is so subtle that he strikes me as a person that tries to bury his innocence because in reality it does not matter few would argue that morgan freeman is brilliant as usual but here the supporting cast throws in with equally impressive performances the score outside the music from the records appearing in the movie the relatively unrestrictive score just helps us confirm what our eyes see the walls of shawshank we feel them through the music and break through them as andy does and last but not least my compliments on the cinematography the site is perfect for the movie and the clever camera angles and lighting invite us into the dreary prison world just the joke dpeople wonder why i hate this movie so much and i have to say that its just purely unoriginal i mean cmon how many times have you heard the story of a guy whos wrongfully accused of a crime and somehow escapes prison using a stupid spoon if theres one thing i look for in a movie then its got to be originality ill let it go if its based on a novel or a musical but cmon a plot this unoriginal doesnt deserve any credit i would humbly suggest that before praising or damning the shawshank redemption that one take a considered look at the new york times best 1000 films ever made list unfortunately the guidelines of this site preclude meoh gentle reader from giving you the url one should be able to google it so all is not lost the nyt was good enough to excerpt the list from peter nichols the new york times guide to the 1000 best films ever made what the shawshank redemption is not on this list you say perhaps humble viewer you havent seen enough films of the first rank but have no fear this is a remediable condition but be a dear and do try to see some of the movies on the listplease before voting on this site i really hate to see so many people make the mistake of voting for the wrong sort of movies onto the top 10 of imdbs very interesting site its ever so declasse remember an educated public is an informed public now do your part this drama has been widely vaunted as one of the best films ever made personally i just cant see the appeal sure it contains very good performances by tim robbins and morgan freeman but there have been other much better screen performances by other actors there is very little suspense or originality about the plot and nothing that hasnt been seen or done on screen a hundred times before so why the popularity its a formulaic feel good movie whos happy ending is never in doubt knowing that stephen king wrote the novel on which the film was based would probably give that away anyway as with any adaptation from book to film there are several differences between the two though the film does on this occasion improve on the book there have been better adaptations of king novels the shining and better performances by better actors yet for some reason this film continues to be rated as better than it actually isthis movie was so hyped for no reason and so boring everyone i talk to told me that it was ok but kind of boring this is the same answer i get from people i dont even know now that i think about it know its kind of like breaking bad someone said it was great so everyone else saids it two beuase they heard the talk from one source it was interesting but dont watch it if your kind of tired it will put you right to sleep just like breaking bad if you have sleeping problems breaking bad and this movie are the cure and i still think even though the 90 batmans are stuipd they are close to the comic books that we all read unlike this movie which is the exact thing and who ever said dark is realistic i live in arizona its bright all the time maybe in alaska that would be realistic in my lifetime there are nothing but colors that surround me so who ever said that is a idiot first of all i must say that when the new batman project was announced i had good memories and the best expectations i watched eagerly on the big screen batman begins as long the movie was reeling forward my enthusiasm was reeling back boring lot of good actors lost on a non coherent story and then the end credits i didnt doubt for a second that maybe i was too much attached to the burtons ones that probably with beetlejuicescissorhands and nightmare beforeare his best movies as director because later he lost his magic the three movies from this new revamp are overrated and totally waste the chance to really bring the dark knight into a fresh and mature path lot of money wasted on nothing the plots are bold and the actors wasted the nolan touch in my opinion overrated ruins this saga the same as the inception film and the supermans revamping unless in marvel they try to be close to their comics to maintain the spirit cause one good thing about the comics is that the script is already done not need to change much just adapt it visually to the big screen no more no less mario puzo can teach nolan how to write a serious superheros movie i know almost everyone high rates this saga but with the same theory everybody loves junk food and it doesnt mean its nutritious or healthy peter jackson who is talented at one thing and one thing only spectacle finishes his hugely successful trilogy im so glad this less than mediocre hack was given the job of writing and directing the film adaptations of the some of the best written fantasy literature ever the innacuracy of the story shoddy pacing inconsistent characterization via poorly written dialogue and hugely misunderstood character relationships and statuses are the largest sins committed in this film but the problem goes deeper this is just another in a long line of films quite nicely summed up by the word blockbuster and quite nicely critiqued by the trio may it rip documentary the blockbuster imperative in which the course of popular culture is outlined as a quest for and to quench the thirst for excitement rather than enrichment thank you peter jackson for shitting on the world you are so over rated it hurts me and your movies will never stand the test of time  normally i dont read comments from others before a movie but now i did cause i was wondering why this movie got such a high rating a lot of people say its fantastic and i read some people who really hated it im not a bat man fan though i had bat toys as a kid a long time ago so i went in pretty open minded i still dont know why this movie got such a high rating i fell asleep 2 times during it ok im a bit tired lately but a good movie sure keeps me awake the story is kinda lame the classical batman story is good versus bad pretty simple and straightforward but the writers chose to abandon this theme more or less stating that good will always turn to evil given enough time yea sounds pretty deep but isnt go read nietzsche i found it all pretty predictable and where it wasnt it was too far fetched to ever be realistic it leans on the psychology angle to pressure people to chose bad over good kinda like saw and others but not as good as that actually that theme gets worn out pretty fast the pace seems way off in the beginning i was like huh whats all happening going way too fast other passages are too slow prolly where i fell asleep the art of telling a story any story is to take the listener or viewer along for the ride with all possible means this just doesnt happen its not the worst movie ever but surely not the best either the acting is pretty ok freeman and caine always deliver batman obviously has a cold as soon as he puts his cape on or watched darth vader too often and replicates it as a 10 year old the joker is totally not funny and where he should portray the madness the only thing he knows to show is to stick his tongue out periodically didnt find him scary at all not funny nor interesting they nominated the guy for an oscar the only reason i can think of why that is is cause hes dead im not saying his acting is bad but its by far not that good you either die a hero or live to become a villain has to be made true by awarding a posthumous oscar effects and stunts are ok but nothing new or exiting all in all its doable but i wouldnt recommend it to anyone over ~13 gave it a 5 cause its not all bad maybe i just outgrew batman no were not destined to do this forever and in fact before redoing a batman you need a really good angle on it so think twice it was a good movie but it wasnt as spectacular or amazing as everyone has been saying it would be you should see this in the cinemas but only because the quality of the film just wouldnt be there if you got it out on dvd not a good film for the children good for teenagers adults and anyone familiar with the batman franchise if you have not seen the first movie then there are several places in the dark knight where you will get a bit confused as they add in references and it is assumed you have seen the first film end result see it in the movies before you go watch batman returns try not to read reviews done by professional film critics as that could ruin the movie for youi have not been able to get over more than 15 minutes of this movie despite several attempts due to the fact that everybody is always so keen on pulp fiction i suppose the trick must lie somewhere after these 15 minutes but it is rare to see such uninteresting characters two otherwise so great actors really chat for such an incredibly long time without any sense in their dialog at all i simply cant get beyond that initial quarter of an hour even with fast forwarding why is everyone so frantic about this film i felt i simply had to comment on this movie so as to somewhat spoil the in my opinion undeservedly excellent ratingwhy ill tell you why this is my opinion first of all i cant believe its in top five of all times this is unbelievable and i think even the producer is surprised of the position of his movie im just asking you to think about what major revolutions the movie has brought first of all the story was already used in a previous moviethe lord of the rings 1978 the special effects are great but what about the matrix the music and the costumes are great but this is ordinary for a movie with that budget and the plot is for kidslets face it with no passion or feelings etc just the old war between good and evil witch is present in any jean claude van damme or stallone movie im very sad not because the world is insane about the movie because the movie is in top 5 of all times so they leaving me no chance but to vote the movie with 1look i understand how many people love this film good acting pretty solid storyline etc but one thing that is also a factor is what generation of movie audiences it is geared toward i am a teenager and while i do love guns killing and all that good teenage stuff that is in this movie many people of my generation do not take such interest in mafia thrillers i feel that they are a thing of the past and therefor i do not identify with this movie in the slightest and basically dont love it as much as many people seem to having said this i actually liked goodfellas more then the godfather not because of the mafia ties but the struggles that the man character underwent struggles that i can identify with this was something the godfather lacked again its not bad its just ok this whole movie is empty really empty im not saying every movie has to give message cos i dont believe in that but this so called masterpiece seems to be about nothing events are unconnected what is uma thurmans characters almost dying has to do with the bruce willis boxer storyline whats boxer storyline has to do with the main characters or why is there a boxer it all seems unnecessary now please tell me how this work of art can described as masterpiece because of the directing famous soundtrack or acting i can say ok to all that but this movie only contains unconnected events characters and has no main storyline and we dont know what this is about i can hardly say tarantino is a big director i cant call a man full of emptiness and bullst a master his only film i like is kill bill which surprisingly different from this garbages has a main storyline nows where to going and i can only name kill bill a masterpiecei enjoyed the movie until the last scene when they decided to hide the truth about harvey it really change my opinion about the movie because what i care about is the purpose the main idea the solution offered in this movie is very bad showing this idea in public in the cinema as a good idea is the worst thing to do hiding the truth is something that keeps destroying our faith in each other our trust in the closest people to us its destroying the societies all around the world in every nation its something we should fight and not encourage so what if the white knight couldnt keep his word he is a human being and part of being a human being is making mistakes i think there is a lot better end for this movie an idea that completes the greatness of the story and the show the white kngiht falls and feel sorry about it he lives and serves time while writing a book about ideals and about how the man loses himself that book will encourage another lawman to become the next white knight who learned from the mistakes of harvey this way the next movie will be about the adventures of the new white knighteither someone stuffed the ballot box on this one or people are merely voting for an icon without really thinking about it this movie does not even remotely deserve its reputation there is no significant character development it is too long and thats an understatement and in quite a few places the plot drags interminablyi found this movie really boring i am sure it was great when it first came out but it just doesnt have a lot of substance to it marlon brando comes off as just plain annoying talking like a retard throughout it also what little action there is comes off as boring way too long for its own good but al pacino did play his part well i prefer goodfellas over this any day its much more face paced and witty  i found this movie really boring i am sure it was great when it first came out but it just doesnt have a lot of substance to it marlon brando comes off as just plain annoying talking like a retard throughout it also what little action there is comes off as boring way too long for its own good but al pacino did play his part well i prefer goodfellas over this any day its much more face paced and wittythis movie is like football people only watch it because the think its cool or popular but really it is the most dreary repetitive and slow film i have had the displeasure in viewing how this film grew to be such a great i do not know bu ti know that it shouldnt be shawshank redemption may not deserve to be second best film ever but at least it is worthy of being where it is and is certainly a better film than any of the godfathers so please consider this when voting the godfather is poorly directed badly scripted crudely acted and most importantly is quite frankly boring and wearisomejim kunsler is not a regular film critic he is an accomplished published author and highly educated in arts and literature i subscribe to his blog usually for his political writing there are hardly any film critics around the newspaper magazine internetzimdb & tv folks are just reviewers as opposed to critics they mumble about good or bad thumbs up how much money is involved and other nonsense in what is an ignorant parody of consumer reports as if the art of film were a microwave oven or brand of toilet tissue in writing about the incredibly popular movie the dark knight kunsler has actually written a piece of film criticism he puts the film in the context of our present national and international culture economy and values you can see what jim kunsler has done at his website http wwwkunstlercom you can read his blog entries at http tinyurlcom 6acfvg having negative opinions about this film does not constitute trolling as defined by wikipedia the film was entertaining but was arguably worse than other batman films from the past there appeared to be a shift from the comic book hero being the main protagonist to the joker being the main character the purpose of such a film had more to do with the marketing of the film within the controversy of and blatant exploitation the actor heath ledgers death this has lead to arguably and debatable claims about ledgers performance in the film this is understandable as his fans will not tolerate any negativity with regards his performance as a result this message board is dominated by those who totally dismiss the great performance of other batman villains such as danny de vito as the penguin and the list is long there as has been some very intelligent comments detailing how this film veers from the comic book hero upon which it is based to a dark cop film none the less the film is a hit and ledger fans expect heath ledgers role as the joker to earn an oscar and go down as the greatest performance of an actor in the history of film i personally believe that heath ledgers and christopher nolans interpretation of the joker a bit too morbid but none the less effective as a villain overall the film was contrived and formulated and the script was a bit dodgy as far as story line but so are all comic book hero films i thought christian bales performance as batman was great but the digitally enhanced voice effect made him seem too dark a knight in fact judging by this forum one would think that batman was now the villain and the joker was the great good guy it was far from being a great film and eventually the hysteria from the more juvenile minds will subside and the film will fade into the esoteric world of the batman collector i dont know what film i saw but i know i wasted 152 mins of my life theres virtually nothing positive about this film perhaps its the over hyped thats ruined an average film the film obviously suffered from the loss of heath ledger though its unclear at what point in the filming this happened if at all maybe its just been terribly scripted and badly edited theres no suspense every idea in the film has been seen before i think the whole cinema sat in disbelief in how bad this film is at the end there was only relief that it had finished caine is superbly cast as alfred bale lacks from a poor script and a empty storyline which is a shame because batman begins was pretty good film maybe this film appeals the american audience but on the opening night at my local cinema in n london 99% of people walked out very disappointedafter i was done watching this movie i was sitting there waiting for it to begin there was no story there was nothing for viewers to hope to happen or not to happen unbearably trite performances all around can morgan freeman play anything other than morgan freeman i was waiting for the scene when he tells batman that he is really god and that batman has to be god for a day ie batman almighty were given no reason to care about anything that happens to any of the characters this was a classic example of weak screen and story writing covered up by special effects explosions and other eye candy the only thing redeeming about it was some decent ambiance and directing but in that regard it did not live up to batman begins nolan is past the point in his career where he has something to prove the love is gone and its showing in a big way the batmobile was fun to watch but that hardly makes a movie please look past the special effects and give this movie the rating it deserves make nolan and other film makers do more than throw gobs of money at ilm to make a movieis this what now passes for entertainment can this really be compared for depth and breadth with other generally highly rated movies such as the godfather casablanca or even star wars many of the imdb top movies deal with the good old battle between good and evil and the world weariness of the hero or anti hero but this film lands far short of the mark in both character and plot development not to mention script acting screenplay or any of the other attributes of a movie that might be worthy of commendation the purity of the comic book origins of this piece are thoroughly distorted and turned into an incoherent muddle almost any james bond movie has a great deal more tension humour conviction and morality than this mess of a movie on the other hand if theres a serious message in the dark knight i missed it as i suspect will thousands of others as a batman flick it simply doesnt deliver anything like the expectations at yet another level as a post 9 11 human condition search for identity movie it also fails however you want to see it it fails on a grandiose scale for some of who do not live in the in the us the dark knight has the potential to appear as little more than an appalling piece of hyped up propaganda for a moribund social policy that permits and legitimises evil mayhem and general wrongdoing and unpleasantness on a colossal scale in the pursuit of defeating the threats against society ive had more fun at the cinema studying the architecturethis film wasnt awful it was pretty decent but the rating isnt for the film itself but as a counter to all those who have over rated it were it not for the exaggerated response to the movie through peoples want to have seen something great rather than to have actually witnessed it then a rating of 6 feels right film is over long doesnt sufficiently build characters to the point where we care what happens to them relies heavily on shocks crashes bangs and gadgets and is probably best suited to teenage boys who are already batman fans spiderman and batman the original were better movies and this feels more like james bond without the humour than a standout classicim going to have to be brief because i hate this movie so much 1 the joker is too invincible he is so invincible he can drive a bus out of a public place rig a hospital and two boats and no one notices also everyone he comes in contact with even teenagers want to work for him even though he will kill them once needed 2 pointless characters lao should have been written out of the film he adds nothing and amounts to nothing pointless the guy who knows who batman is goes no where and his character only amounts to a stupid explosion 3 breaks the main rule of cinema the protagonist defeats the antagonists there are two main villains in this movie and batman doesnt defeat either one 4 harveys motivation in the end i hated harvey through out the film but once hes two face he just becomes dumb he believes that people should have a 50 50 chance like rachel though thats not what happened gordan was just late so now hes going to and kill gordans son there are other problems but those are the most major and i can not believe instead of noticing these problems people and went and gave it #8 on the top 250 i went to see this movie with no expectations at all because im not a fan of batman and big budget hollywood movies usually disappoint me although i think this movie is totally overrated i liked the joker character played by heath ledger and the story was ok too the film itself was week in my opinion it depended too much on the action and it didnt deserve to be titled the dark knight at all tim burtons batman was much more dark in my opinion and there was more of an artistic element to it while tdk was just an action movie despite of all i completely understand why people like it this movie has enough action and special effects to entertain most people and a pretty good story for an action movie but i certainly think that it doesnt deserve to be third in imdb top250  damn i cant believe the reviews for this film ive only seen this twice and dont plan on seeing it again anytime soon and this coming from a lifelong batman movie fan note the emphasis on movie not comicsive seen the original film 200000 times and i loved all the sequels even the campy schumacher ones but boy did they take this franchise in a reverse direction just because batman & robin was terrible and silly doesnt make christopher nolans films the comic book equivalent of the godfather or gone with the frigging wind if anything they only show how amazing tim burtons 2 original dual pictures are and how utterly lame the nolan ones are not only is the dark knight worse then batman begins its downright ridiculous you feel like you need a degree in law to understand what the hell they are talking about its like csi meets gotham city you might as well call this movie gcpd or gcpd blue or any of those law and order type shows that this movie seems to copy from its even more silly when you look at the lengths the director went through to make this batman movie as boring as possible they seem to think if the story is engaging enough we dont have to make the movie visually appealing thats like saying if the story is good enough we dont have to make batman look awesome in the comics lets get this review started shall we first the joker we are all familiar im sure with jack nicholsons classic portrayal from the original film it was truly amazing he made the character eerie funny and charming all at once yet he seemed to understand that this character is based off cartoons and as such you cant take yourself all that seriously this is the complete opposite of what heath ledger does with the same role but i guess you cant really blame the actor entirely with nolan wanting to change up batman and his world to the point that the characters arent really who they should be first off joker doesnt fall in a vat of acid like the original he puts on makeup and cuts his own smile and dyes his hair green i would hate to see his joker in the rain he would look rather pathetic as a joker i can guarantee that if nicholson didnt already do this classic comics origin 20 years ago in the awesome first film fan boys would be crying that joker was turned into common serial killer done a million times over in other films and not the funny amusing comic book clown prince of crime that everyone is more familiar with oh but since nicholson already played that version to perfection nolan was somehow able to get away with turning joker into a common killer that weve seen time and again heath didnt really even play the¥éË joker he played generic serial killer bad guy #13314 for those who would defend ledger by saying he was really scary and terrifying sure ill give them that but to say he was better than nicholson jack freaking nicholson pleeeeeeeeeease the role was virtually made for the man when he was born¥éË nicholson captured the true essence of the joker a psychopathic man child out not to prove a good damn thing but to kill and mess around with people all for the laughs these are traits that define the joker not some clichÜ© ideal of wanting people to accept that evil exists in all of us and that brings me to another point whats with this jokers anarchist pseudo philosophic rambling monologues boy nolan loves these cardboard deep monologues he has his character spew out all the time even in the last film its laughable at how serious he takes the movie did he forget this is based off of comic books and that there are supposed to be fun elements in the film tim burton struck the perfect balance of comic book and reality its somewhere right in the middle nolan puts a guy in a bat suit and places him right in middle of an unaltered real life city it makes him look silly and out of place im not gonna dwell much on bales batman this guy cant save any movie hes in people seem to love this guy or think hes some brilliant actor but hes obviously just a wooden actor and once again phoned in his performance in this film to quote christopher walken from batman returns hes just a poor schmo who got lucky his batman voice is ludicrous ludicrous i still dont understand why they decided to make batman sound like an engine turning over every time he talks he makes me laugh the only decently done things in this film is how harvey dent is portrayed pre twoface and the pretty nifty bat pod that has one cool scene in which it bursts from the bat mobile but again the action scenes never pick up because of nolans hard on for realism so nothing in the new batman films ever makes you go ooh awesome for too long this movie just dragged and i remember looking at the clock as to when it would end they make it feel like the new batmans are smart but honestly in a comic book movie who the heck wants to listen to all this law and order talk and long drawn out deep monologues its someh id rather watch jack nicholson laugh like a maniac shooting his henchman and making me laugh who can forget gems like bob gun today you have why so serious yeah thats what i want to know why so serious nolan why cant you make batman fun nothing against having darkness burtons films were dark too but not so much to the point where they werent fun or exciting again disappointed from where to start maybe from my disappointment with imdb and vote engine or just leave that and straight go to the description of this movie 1 bad directingup up up in tension and then totally down with low intelligent denouement 2 bad script too much talkingt non stop talking superheros and villains talking all the time everything must be explained 3 joker performance is nothing more than little above mediocre im counting this in list because so much talking in public about awesome performance by ledgerwell maybe if you didnt watch any film with al pacinoif you just put attention to it you will see legder is trying the best to act like al pacino in talking scenes 4 too much slow and heart breakingyeah lordoftherings scenes 5 film is next elections campaing nothing more and film have few good things to be honest 1 music is great pumping tension whole film 2 masks are very good2face mask is perfect short this film in top ten alltime movies bah i already wrote a review on the dark knight being full of anger and antipathy for that movie but now i realized that the best thing to do is help others to make a decision whether that praised film will awesomely entertain or simply shock them ill forbear from spoilers the dark knight wasnt the movie i expected i thought it would be like batman begins where people had motives for deeds and still surprising moments where batman was a troubled character finding his way back to psychological stability dealing with obstacles and fighting hard never to corrupt his morals it wasnt considered soberly the dark knight was a complete surprise it said the journeys not over and it will not end where you expect it to end moreover and thats also announced in the movie the main villain has no motives hes simply evil loves to hurt and corrupt people and is differently to what he proclaims not a chaotic person but an organizing and planning genius almost or i believe definitely able to foresee the future and heres the lack of the film the joker is unbeatable whatever batman and the police try the cannot defeat him hes like a mythological god of chaos owed to the writers corrupting people with i have to admit known but corrupting dilemma situations and thats quite hard to bear if youre a sensitive person youll sit there and suffer if youre sensitive and intellectual youll simply understand that movie as a nightmare and you should take that literally because if you are its an unpleasant annoying or even fierce situation with äóñ what you call äóñ logic taken away so if youre wondering whether to watch and youre a person like me who believes that a movie either has to be realistic or if fiction has to contribute to giving you a good feeling or being a better person or something like that do not watch that movie you will go out and have to deal with a serious quarrel about these i believe fake teachings you saw in that movie for all the others please take my advice i have to admit that i am maybe a bit too sweet tempered or something but please dont take that movie too serious in movies the too positive ones i often caught myself believing what happened there without reflecting please do not do that here its a negative movie destroying the super hero legend having been established in batman begins surrendering to the believe that anyone can be corrupted and will be corrupted unless they die first thanks for reading im not going to comment on individual performances or technical aspects these are covered elsewhere what made tdk a disappointment for me was the loss of story halfway through in the beginning there are enough coherent scenes strong supporting cast and even flashes of brilliance to tempt you into sticking with this latest episode in the comic book as film noir franchise but tdk loses any sense of scale the story leaves you high and dry it loses any relation it had to an engaging story of complex supeheroes and Ü_bervillains and becomes an unnecessarily complicated overwrought overstuffed mess the film becomes like a nightmare fairground where all the sideshows are at full volume in your face and all of them drowning each other out in the hope that you wont notice that none of them are very interesting at all just like that mobile phone multiscreen towards the long distant end which doesnt make sense as a plot device as a technical gizmo or as anything that one operator could make head ot tail of minority report had a similar imaginary device that looked believable this wasnt even in the post luc besson design world tdk is supposed to inhabit the point where tdk quite literally loses the plot is when da dent is switched to become two face which would naturally be the point where you would expect the movie to end except that the joker isnt anywhere near being dealt with at that point so tdk has to carry on with a completely new villain in order to resolve the story of the old villain and it doesnt do that properly either in all tdk is like half a good film with a bad one tacked on the end loaded with flashes and bangs in the hope you wont noticeeven for a blockbuster cotton candy movie this is a piece of crap got a script that makes so sense characters that you dont care about and mindless violence and unbelievable set pieces how do you know the joker is a guy that just likes to see things burn why first alfred tells us that and if you didnt get it the first time the joker then tells us he just likes to see things burn and sure enough if that was too subtle for you he then sets things on fire then there is the fact that keep on calling him a terrorist when he goes on about how he only care about chaos first of all a terrorist is a person who acts because they do have a strong belief not because they have no beliefs terrorist do the things they do with a goal in mind they are in fact the total opposite of the joker character then you have a film thats basic message is hey sometimes its ok to lie and pretend someone is a hero when they arent wow what a wonderful things to support im sure george w bush loved this film then there is the acting how hard is it to play completely crazy not that damn hard just because health ledger is dead doesnt mean his acting is suddenly good he was not a great actor and he sure isnt in this film too long so boringmy lack of faith in the audience is justified how can this film be so highly rated when its total garbage batman was my favourite comic book the dark tortured hero really appealed to me but this film really is a mess where do i begin probably the biggest problem of any bad movie the characters batman the one were supposed to identify with and feel his plight is so wooden in this film that i could mistake him for a tree christian bales batman seems devoid of any emotion or any internal plight plus in a film that is supposed to be about him batman seems relegated to a supporting role in tdk hes merely a goon with a bad case of laryngitis i know hes supposed to disguise his voice but its so over the top its laughable this is were keaton and conroy got it right he seldom talks when he does the voice change is subtle not sounding like a goon on a sugar high the joker the main villain heath ledgers performance is good with what hes given but the writing for the joker is all wrong joker in this film is actually a very generic psychopath if it wasnt for the make up i would have never guessed it was supposed to be the joker the joker isnt supposed to be a nihilist everything to him is a big joke even murder has to be funny to him ledgers joker lacking virtually any sense of humour hes more akin to jack the ripper who seems to have an obsession with knives and scars also what put me off is how the joker always looks physically ill constantly hunched over waddling about constantly licking and smacking his lips like his saliva is on overdrive this simply doesnt work for a clownish criminal amusing himself with the exceptions of michael caine and morgan freeman the actors in the film just seemed rather lazy like they wanted the film to end as quickly as possible and collect their pay cheque why in a film where characters are supposed to be the central focus be so wooden and one dimensional with them the film flops completely on its characters the directing was equally sloppy a lot of pointless noise and generic action scenes that seem to be put in as filler in order to extend the film to the 150 minute mark excessive cuts that make the action difficult to follow and often in poor light where we cant see anything equally pointless was the plot in fact its more a collection of subplots none of them with any closure or resolution to them with the sloppy cuts it also leaves enough plot holes to sink this film into an incoherent mess yet i hear this film heralded as a masterpiece i see critics and fan reviews who just gush over this film has the standard of film making really reached this low 20 years ago a film called robocop came out a very silly concept at its core but the characters are what made the film work we could identify with robocop ironically enoughtim burtons despite its plot flaws the characters were well created and acted and kept to the spirit of the source material tdk has no such redeeming featuresi first saw this movie when i rented it out from my local video store i can honestly say it is the worst movie i have ever seen it doesnt even deserve the right to be called a movie i am a big fan of episodes 1 and 2 and i wasnt really disappointed with 3 but empire strikes back is just horrible the acting is dreadful the bad guys arent scary of funny and arent even both guys the kid who plays luke skywalker is dreadful and your left hoping the bad guys actually get him and strangle him the storyline is just stupid and why they decided to keep the same characters as the first two home alones is beyond me overall i have to say this movie is a big disappointment and i only gave it the rating 1 because i had to if i could give it a zero i wouldspoilers frankly put this movie sucked what could have been spectacular with only a little care was ruined oh dont get me wrong if you are some lazy movie goer who considers yourself an expert because you own the extended editions of the first two movies on dvd you will certainly enjoy this movie if you are like me a hardcore fan who has practically memorized the books i dont see how you can enjoy this film it starts out fairly well and continues like that for most of the film although the changes are not usually welcome at all cite arwens magnified part to make it sappy or gollum and frodo leaving sam altogetheri could have accepted that sure shelobs lair was all wrong well yeah it did annoy me that at some parts aragorn was more important than the whole ring of power which must be destroyed the whole love triangle was blown way out of proportion and by editing out his almost death it might have been possible to film some of the wonderful scenes in the book that the movies carelessly deleted but like i said it was all right until the end the ring was destroyed magnificently i admit the aftermath was done well but there is no excuse for skipping straight to the happy ending lalala sunflowers and daisy chains and frolicking puppies for all what the just happened no scouring of the shire for that saruman just might have been left out altogether no adjustment for frodo i might also add that by having gollum and sam make so much external conflict for him it practically obliterates all the internal conflict the audience is unprepared and confused when he decides to keep the ring however back to the mangled ending put aside the major parts in an effort to appeal to teenage girls i assume the filmmakers decided to give arwen a much larger role and make eowyns affection for aragorn much more serious as well so why do they not bother showing her courtship with faramir a large part of the books is condensed into two camera shots of them standing beside each other at the coronation of glorious king aragorn who seems to have washed his hair for the occasion i know he was on a trek in the wilderness no shampoo but how come he shaved more then but back to eowyn her sudden attachment to faramir makes her seem like she is nothing but a man chaser first she goes after aragorn future king and current war hero when he spurns her love she takes faramir steward and war hero as the next best option ridiculous just ridiculous to sum up do not see this movie do not waste your money this review is long i know but it could be so much longer if i wanted to mention everything wrong with the movies anyone who is a true fan will regard this as nothing but filth a pure waste of timewell this movie is not for people who like subtlety not for people who like good dialogues not for people who like interesting characters it is for people who love action action and nothing much else for people who love pompous battles on big screens hollow words rhetorics of of the kind great dictators are so fond of big words like today mankind will not fail sure i can see why people like this movie they are just easily pleased they see a big battle scene and theyre happy they see orcs orcs and still more orcs and they think wow these orcs must be metaphors for all the bad bad people that are out there on this evil evil planet how deep what geniuses are tolkien and peter jackson they see a helicopter view of a battlefield great graphics of a fictional city a realistic monster spider and theyre happy they see good triumph over evil and they think thats the way it should be because well uhm because its different from real life i guess it gives them uhm hope it must be nice to not see that cheap emotions the flat characters some of the most stereotyped dialogues ever written in the history of film it must be great to be able to love this movie this would go down as one of the worst movie of the year an overhyped tale i havent read the book but after seeing the movie i will steer clear of anything to do with the lord of the rings the convinently call able ghost army made it the most anti climatic ending after the 6 8 hrs spent building the tension over the 3 movies it is the same as the anti climatic fight at helms deep when gandalf appears to save the day what was the purpose of the elves there were so many holes in the plot the emphasis that sam wise was not gay was sickening meant wasting 5 mins in the end showing he marries a woman and has 3 kids to make it more suitable to the times frodo and sam wise should have just come out of the closet it is a shame that people have voted it to become in the top 3 movies at imdb  happy 20th anniversary not did i watch the exact same movie which so many people have referred to and think its some holy pop cultural iconic movie i just dont get it and ill never get it to be honest i feel like calling this film stupid people going around doing stupid things  im not joking one thing after the other in this movie just confused me the entire time i was like huh everything about the story lines occurrences the dialogue and the pay off was just stupid and the f bomb is dropped in every other sentence so much so i felt like punching the screen in its said so much to the extent where it gets really annoying i like samuel l jackson especially for his stars wars and marvel superhero work but i dont care if hes mostly known for this i hate him playing such over the top nonsensical controversial characters and i hate films that just take advantage of even white washing the names of christians and have the bad guy quote bible verses thats dangerous its brainwashing & manipulation want my advice of a real christian is rachel scott of columbine who was killed for her faith dietrich bonhoeffer who spoke out against hitler and nazi germany or even dr kent hovind who reveals a lot of amazing scientific evidence for the fact of special creation and biblical accuracy all much better and meaningful then this overrated pile of worthless celluloid nothing though to be fair i think quentin does have an decent taste in soundtrack variety i admit ive got those songs on my ipod as a result of watching this flick and i do think the scene of christopher walkens watch talk does for some reason relax me simply because its simply walken his delivery & his way of talking is somewhat kind of relaxing and amusing all at once hes been interesting ever since i saw him in the comedy mousehunt though the scene still is stupid when the captain or general whatever curses at a young boy about the a$$ and how even a young boy would want such a filthy watch after being inside many mens anuses for a long time i mean tarantinos just some director i dont like or care about he claims hes against drugs and violence then dont make films about them you may be just condoning or giving ideas about drugs and violence youre definitely part of the hollyweird group arent you im all round just thank everything that is holy sacred and beneficial that i didnt see this film when i was younger 1994 definitely was the big year for many good movies but pulp fiction is certainly not one of them it shouldnt have even been nominated for anything not even best picture imo the lion king shouldve been nominated in its place instead a film thats all the more likable fun entertaining relatable family friendly and beautifully put together its art but guess not since hollyweird has got such a fetish for pure violence murder sexual immorality and biased anti christian propaganda pulp fiction is just painful to sit through tarantinos a hack and ive never liked or will ever like any of his filmsthis movie is overrated and frankly sucks as a film it has very few elements of a good film and was toooooo long anyone can make a good movie in about four hours the trick is to stay under three hours and still have a forceful impact the movie had too many fronts there were frodo sam gollum aragorn dead people mary rohirran and gandalf pippin the movie is good entertainment if youre willing to sit long enough lotr freaks have kept giving this movie a 10 making a mockery of the voting no thought is actually being given during voting and personally i think people should just give it a one just to counteract the false voting this is not a movie deserving of an academy award sweep i remember watching it on opening night and seeing the audience confused about when to leave fanboys with staffs and fake beards got up a good twenty minutes before the final roll and then quickly sat down realizing that hey it aint done well it should have been i think that if you win an award for something it needs to be great at whichever aspect throughout the movie won for editing but it wasnt edited well throughout the direction wasnt anything to hoist high either i didnt find the acting dynamic in any way and if i see one more helicopter sweep of the mountains as our heroes run oh never mind oh and the giant arachnid was nice but some of the other special effects ugh nonetheless the series was impressive because the time it was turned around in but i dont think they needed to sacrifice quality for getting em out three christmas in a row some of the special effects in the final lava sequence looked like land of the lost for chrissakes so for those of you who want to argue that they deserved awards because of the daunting task of turning around such films forget it they could have taken their time like harry potter and done fine i dont even like harry potter but i dont see flaws i dont see repetition the acting is more impressive so why award them when they didnt even live up to their best potential i look forward to the fan boys saying my comments werent helpful thats why i gave it one star if fan boys are going to bully the vote to put these movies in the upper echelon of films which is ridiculous i reserve the right to underscore them to help future generations know that the fans are delusional and overzealousbrando was about the only semi decent thing in this mainly because he was hardly in it and i like brando overlong poorly edited piece of garbage first things first the movie looks like crap gordon willis cinematograpthy is absolutely appalling the editing is just bizarre it looks like it was made by a film maker trying to simulate tension or sadness and tragedy but had no ideas how to use the tools an experienced director would have used the music made me want to smash my brains in and james caan as an italian american gangster was just ridiculous it would be like getting danny glover to play maculay culkins character in home alone but then again as someone who has seen a lot of the movies produced by coppola like peggy sue got married tucker the man and his dream the cotton club finnians rainbow the rainmaker and many more poorly filmed dated badly written pieces of forgettable rubbish i should have expected the godfather to be as appalling as i found it but as everyone who has ever seen the godfather who happens to be a film buff and not just a normal guy in the street who will watch the occasional movie they tend to drool over this muddy looking scrappy overlong bore fest all in all i would say this movie should probably be destroyed so morons cant talk about how it is the holy grail of all movies ever madei do not understand all the praise this movie gets i expected a masterpiece but i was let down by a weak story and mostly sub par acting i do not really feel it is a 1 star movie i would probably give it 4 or 5 stars if i was to be honest about it but i felt i needed to help drop its rating from the ridiculous 97 it currently has it started off strong and very emotionally as bonasera played magnificently and convincingly by salvatore corsitto told don corleone about the tragic and severe beating two boys gave his daughter when she refused to let them have their way with her begging corleone to deliver justice she was beaten so badly that her nose was crushed and her jaw was completely shattered i actually teared up a bit at this due to the amazing delivery he gave of his lines after that the movie just goes flat in my opinion no wonder coppola put that scene at the very beginning there is just nothing interesting about the storyline of this movie its a bunch of stuff about a bunch of italian mobsters from mob families do for 3 hours other than corsittos brief performance all other acting in this movie is cold and uninteresting there is almost no real character development especially with michael corleone al pacino and the woman he marries while hiding out for a year in italy it was just so out of place and random i just kind of scratched my head about that i didnt even remotely care that she died when somebody rigged their car with a bomb and blew it up honestly i was happy that she was out of the story if anything what little story there is anyway in the end while there were some promising things in the film it never really capitalized on them it just seemed like most of the film was a hodge podge of small unrelated shallow stories of which none were fully explored i just thought this film was frustratingly dull i did not give a damn about any character in the film they just seemed so distant with so very little development and actual substance because of this whenever any of them died i did not care much the movie takes itself far too seriously for its own quality it is self indulgent and bland the worst thing about the movie was al pacinos acting i never thought i would say that about al pacino as he has always been by far one of my favorite actors he is incredible in films like the devils advocate so much talent but it just didnt show in this movie maybe it was the scripts fault i dont understand how he so easily went from not wanting anything to do with the family business to having people killed left and right as the new don it just didnt make any sense to me i will say marlon brando played vito corleone well but even he at many times over acted in his role sometimes he just appeared so cheesy campy thats about all i really have to say about this movie not horrible but far from an all time great its okay there was a good 45 minutes of crap they could have cut to make it not be so needlessly drawn out the bottom line if youve never seen it it might worth a viewing to make up your own mind as apparently many folks feel the opposite of how i do about it just dont be surprised if you fall asleep at some point i recommend brewing up a pot of coffee before hand just in caseit is very sad for me to see such an awful immoral movie on any top list much less number 19 this high rating shows how desensitized the world had made us that people would rave over a movie that shows a man raping another man that uses the f word 200 times in the first 10 minutes that shows what is supposedly pieces of a mans head splatter in a car and that shows people overdosing on drugs is very very disturbing disheartening and sickening there was no redeeming value to this movie it was awful and should not have been given a rating r or for that matter have ever even been released to view i guess if you are morbid and over 30 they should have rented it to you but no one under 30 and certainly no one under 21 should have been able to see this movie i was sixteen when i saw it and i was appalled i was not impressed by the colorful display of language drugs sexual immorality or violence in this movie they should have created a new rating for this movie no one with any type of morals should see this movie whatever letter that would be to see this movie and see the high rating shows me why there are so many murders every year and why there are school shootings you people are so comic it makes me batty is it a good movieyes was it a brilliantly imagined and epic series of filmsyes was it one of the best 50 films of all timenot a chance in hell i dont care if you 15 year olds want to live in fantasy land the rest of your lives but spare us from this lotr are the best movies ever crap we dont need to hear it and it makes us laugh it was a great series to watch but when you come on here and disrespect the film greats of all time and have any of these lotr movies in the top 100 it disrespects the entire film industry if you want to play fantasy time then go on a disney board and post away but do us all a favor and leave the imdb for real movies what is the pulp and what is the fiction of this film this film makes no sense at allthe sad thing is that it does not have any realitygodard has abandoned france and now lives in a tiny swiss town of rolle i can assure that even godard will say that this film has no beginningno middle and no end and that too in no particular senseas quentino tarantino has crooked teeth may be people like his films for that reasonall the actors of this film look confusedthe great actress from portugal maria de medeiros wasted her talent for a minor role which no one will ever bother to rememberalthough it was a comeback vehicle for john travoltahe has not acted wellsam jackson is confusedthe most confused of them all is christopher walkenlet the others make merry but quentin tarantino will bore people to death with silly films like kill billstay way from this film as it is a waste of money i am a teenager and i never thought of finding the godfather so interesting it shows a vivid and perfect example of the words classic and timeless in a movie the godfather takes you to different heights with each scene directed of course by francis ford coppola marlon brando plays one of his funniest for me anyway and greatest role al pacino is another worth mentioning the acting and the presentation of both actors are some of the key success of the godfather having seen the movie makes me want to pick up the book if you need a break from all the recent typical movies then watch the godfather i did not understand what quentin tarantino wanted to convey to the viewers with this film i dont really see what the hype is about when it comes to this movie lack of a solid story and bond between events and choppy weird offensive violent and even sodomy rape there are ample of examples of bad photography throughout the movie i am 49 and for me its a complete waste of my time uma thurman john travolta and bruce willis were brilliant thoughthere is nothing in this movie that will leave a mark in your mind or soul its a style over substance i will not recommend this movie i think this film is the most overrated movie in historyman fellowship was much better than this piece of junk a lot of the shots were horrible the cgi except for gollum sucked the dialogue was beyond cheesy the battles were anti climatic the way the war ended w the dead people was dumb the ending dragged on and on and on i checked my watch at least 15 times during this movie the battle scenes blah and if the fate of the world is in your hands and your supposedly out numbered why freakin joke while your fighting and putting notches on your belt thats just so freakin lame the attempts at comedy in this movie were laughable if you want to watch a movie w real battle scenes do yourself a favor and go see last samurai ive seen that movie 2 times and im going to have to see it again to get the bad taste out of my mouth that is rotkwhen i searched amongst the endless lists of reviews given about this movie i had not found one that gave it less than 7 stars in order to truly see a movie for what it is one must look past all that makes it great into its minor flaws and weaknesses if you the reader were drawn to this review because of the low rating well i am sorry but i have mislead you however i have also led you to something greater and different from the rest of the reviews for this film to get to the point shawshank redemption is magnificently made and deserves incredible amounts of praise for its entertainment value and perspective on life in prison however the themes of the film are rather shallow the entire theme can be summarized in a short sentence friendship and hope can get you through almost anything although it is a great message it is simply a nugget of what could have been much greater now i know that i have only given the film 1 star here but that was only to draw attention so that you may finally see that this film although superb is not perfect by any means as is suggested by the vast quantity of perfect reviews in all honesty i would give it nine stars out of ten and would encourage everybody to see it great not perfect but after all where can true perfection honestly be foundto contradict my summary line this film is actually one of the least appealing films i have ever seen its violent disgusting and crude and none of these are particularly bad traits its just that it offers me nothing and leaves me with an emptiness the fact that i have wasted 2 1 2 hrs watching this then not to be compensated this is entirely my opinion and clearly mine alone nearly everyone loves this film and they are honest enough to clarify it but if my review is completely the opposite i still feel compelled to write im sorry but 9th on the list of the top 250 films seems grossly inappropriatethis movie is overrated plain and simple i watched this piece of garbage and i can only wonder why so many people feel it necessary to jump on the im cool bandwagon two or three decent scenes does not make a movie great face reality this movie stinksim sorry but this is crap this movies contains too much violence for nothing the use of violence in movies is understandable but im not fond of this overdose i do not appreciate it a all of course this is a huge problem with movies especially with the hollywood movies violence in films effects society as not all people can draw the line tarantino do not spare extra crime in his movies and pulp fiction is not an exception the most ridiculous thing is that in a way the violent characters looks cool and fun some of them get away with murder as if its a part of a romantic sweet meaningful episode in their cool lives as in bruce willis character its a shame this movie is on top of the pack with its score here wish u peace & love everyone i dont know what everyone is talking about but watching the back of my hand for two hours while a small cat constantly bit me was way more entertaining than watching this movie id put off seeing this movie for years for fear of being bored unfortunately when it was forced in at a party i couldnt escape i sat there like a normal person awaiting a plot and something entertaining however the words i dont get it and god please make this end were constantly repeated in my head over and over again i think tarintino is one of a kind and in a good way i just dont get whats so great about this movie bottom line i still believe that when too many stars enter a film it will suck maybe one day ill be proven wrong  the director was pretty jealous of the fact that a movie has to end otherwise this movie would never have had an end an interesting start the first movie of the trilogy fellowship of the ring but absolutely boring on the road to the end of it im disappointed with this movie as ive expected more of it the characters seemed wonderful at the beginning but the director made the worst of them shameful more shameful as this is the movie that won the oscar i cannot think of the motives the academy awarded the prize to this movie but the money that went into it its the second time in the history that i know of that the academy appreciates more the cost of a movie than the quality of it and of the actors play its interesting in this approach that no actor in this movie won the oscar why is that  im glad there are a few voices of dissent within all of the gushing hype listed here do the fans of this movie rate citizen kane as the 2nd best film of all time then maybe listen to the beatles and elvis presley as the greatest music of all time is america under some kind of cultural mass hypnosis grossly overrated on all counts am i seemingly in a very small minority that find gangster films so soo sooo very dull i concede that the godfather is the most famous of this genre but as for it forever topping film polls im not so sure and when i say not sure i mean definitely not i also admit that im not a brando fan but if this film is meant to be the best of the best it shouldnt matter if i like brando or not i should still like the film right and i just dont my dad is the biggest brando fan and even he doesnt reach for this film when he fancies a bit of marlon in my opinion carlitos way or the untouchables are far superior filmsof the genre i think the main problem i have with the godfather other then the never ending dullness of it is that it always seems to be saying oh look isnt cool to be in the mob we should all do it of course it all goes belly up the the boys in the end but thats just a convention of the genre that has to be met rather then being the message of the film not my cup of tea at all im afraidi dont know if you have seen the same movie ive seen but this movie was awful i really really liked the first movie an obvious 10 the second was a little bit worse yet still a 7 but this one was really bad i mean what is the reason for a happy happy happy happy end which is 30 minutes too long the characters are flat and no one cares if anyone of the main characters dies or notlike the king because you cant feel connected to them gollum should be dead two times before he is falling into the fire it is just boring after the second part if hords of orks are fighting against man and the worst thing was legolas after sliding down this elephant like animal and posing so bad animated and so silly unfortunately this movie was so disappointing like matrix 3i know this is pointless since it will be in 3000 other reviews and no one will ever read it but whatever anyways on with the review ok ill admit it when i went and first saw this movie in the theatre i thought it was amazing i even did what other people did and started quoting the joker all the time and good lord did that get burnt out real fast but then i bought the movie and kind of thought to myself you know what i should actually try to analyze this movie as a whole and not just pay attention to one persons performanceaka heath ledger so i sat down and watched it and i realized holy crap this movie is bad really bad i did not realize how many plot holes this dang thing had and the fact that it is in imdbs top 10 best movies of all time is just insane look im sorry christopher nolan fans but i have to give you the gods honest truth this movie is not top 10 worthy i think the only reason why this movie has such a high rating is because of obsessive heath ledger fans and the christopher nolan fans who cant stop sucking on his tit they think he can do no wrong well thats what this movie is wrong i mean cmon you christopher nolan fans are telling me that you can honestly sit there and tell me this movie is better than these and yes dark knight is currently ranked higher than all these movies i listed schindlers list saving private ryan terminator 2 the original star wars american history x the lord of the rings fight club forrest gump the matrix the silence of the lambs citizen kane and full metal jacket no no no no no no absolutely not im sorry mister nolan but youre obviously really good at brainwashing your fan base thats the only explanation ive got is that christopher has discovered how to hypnotize people and he can do it very well its ratings on movies like this that really make me think about how stupid society is nowadays im sorry if i sound a little aggressive in this review but i honestly feel this movie does not deserve the huge spotlight that everyone gave it two viewings first viewing reaction possibly the worst film ever made brilliant subtle joker performance weighed down by an overly pretentious film why is batman even in the film confusing chase scenes confusing to the point of boredom ridiculous james bond episode in hong kong at what point between the previous batman film and this one did gotham city miraculously turn into chicago stupid cell phone ploy fell asleep halfway through woke up in the middle of a morgan freeman plea for individual freedom or something like that im bored maybe i missed something second viewing reaction the worst film ever made brilliant subtle joker performance weighed down by an overly pretentious film why is batman even in the film confusing chase scenes confusing to the point of boredom ridiculous james bond episode in hong kong at what point between the previous batman film and this one did gotham city miraculously turn into chicago stupid ridiculous cell phone ploy fell asleep halfway through woke up in the middle of a morgan freeman plea for individual freedom or something like that why am i here one of the worst films ive forced myself to sit through nothing happens except explosions and violence skip it and heath ledgers oscar win was solely for the fact he had died basically i think america had become the only country in the world where a movie like this could be popular a movie about a superhero who wants to clean a fictional metro city up morgan freeman micheal caine anymore oscar winners looking for money and the screen time of this was atrocious i seriously thought the movie was never going to endthis is good example of how to not to make a movie it begins quite dry the main character doesnt seem like he quite knows how to act as he is thrown into a poorly lit scene in what seems to be the directors garage revamped he then goes to prison no sense whatsoever obviously there is a huge paradigm between what the director though the film to be and the original writers we then see all of what we normally find in prison with a very fatal exception no mining i am a personal favorite of mining in prison i love to see people smash rocks and burn coal for fire we mainly find dry dialog from what appears to be actors who have never left their parents basement no wonder the director still films at his home i had to leave the room a few times so that i could get some fresh air while the movie attempted be filmed my advice is to buy this film only if you need a dvd or vhs tape for a scrap booking project the reflective qualities are very nice and the packaging insert can also be used to store a home video be sure not to allow the label to be visible as that may cause your friends to disown you foreverim sorry i dont mean to offend people who like this film but what on earth is all the fuss about over this film it is nothing compared to the godfather and yet people vote it as second to the number 1 the shawshank redemption has a relatively simple plot dull camera work the script is full of soppy language thanks to the overrated steven kingthat just isnt particularly clever in any waythe atmosphere of prison is totally unrealistic all the characters are wimpsthe only good element is morgan freeman because hes a good actorthere arent any clever twists for instance the mystery of what is in the box at the end of the film is really unoriginal please feel free to argue with me over this but come on people step back and look at the film what is it made up of then look at the godfather look at what that is made up of brill cast excellent plot damn good script good directing and camera work everything is perfect then look back at the shawshank redemption its just at a completely different level its quite ridiculous really well made prison buddy drama has no rough edges its so clean cut and conventional its not funny literally its involving you care for the characters and are interested in what happens to them but quite frankly it feels so literary morgan freemans voiceover sounding exactly like a stephen king narration which it is by the way the way red morgan freeman tells the story of mystery man andy dufresnetim robbins is as old as watson telling of mystery man sherlock holmes this formula was invented by arthur conan doyle stephen king has a way of writing that always feels like hes appealing to the masses always trying to sound nostalgic and profound instead of just telling a story thats honest you feel theres this constant need to say something about life the universe and everything countless instances of pretensious philosophising abound in this which sound about as profound as sayings your grandfather tells you some birds are not meant to be caged their feathers are too bright or get busy living or get busy dying or terrible thing to live in fear or it was like some beautiful bird flapped into our drab little cage and made those walls dissolve away or need it so you dont forget forget that there are places in the world that arent made out of stone or hope is a good thing and good things can never die  if you say so sensei also kings stories always feel like someone has sat there trying to think of a good story instead of feeling natural so the reason most things happen in this movie all the little episodes are not because it necessarily fits the character but because it would make a good story for it to happen that way and after a while this gets tiring i just cant take it seriously morgan freeman sounds like grandfather telling a story which can sometimes feel patronising but i suppose to does work well with the period feel of this picture which by definition tries to connect with the past problem is stephen king never leaves anything to the imagination he tells us everything if tim robbins organises some special event for the inmates like playing music over the loudspeaker morgan freemans voice will come right out and suggest a few reasons why this episode is so wonderful significant the nature of which are very similar through each episode of the movie and darabont obviously likes the idea of assuming the audience are very thick and will not see or experience anything unless you dictate to them what to experience and has made his movie by it also im starting to be wary of thomas newman as a composer doing exactly what darabont has done as a director employ a formula that has worked in the past his score for shawshank is calculated on the same formula of highs lows and general atmosphere as in his score for road to perdition american beauty meet joe black horse whisperer scent of a woman and the green mile not surprisingly if you think about all these movies they all have a similar feel they all go for a similar nostalgia haunting sadness which admittedly i find very appealing but im starting to worry at how similar they all are i think encouraging this movie too much is like rewarding someone for employing a formula very successfully instead of taking risks and doing something edgy that still turns out to be enjoyable and brilliant most people do not evaluate movies based on their imdb ranking but i certainly would be surprised if any major lists ranked this in their top ten that said this is still a very good movie with good performances a good unity despite its necessarily episodic nature and it looks great its only for movies people insist on putting on best ever lists that i require a certain originality the feeling that what this movie gives you you could not get anywhere else i believe this is why movies like citizen kane vertigo 2001 raging bull third man grand illusion persona and for me exterminating angel are constantly mentioned on such lists and deservedly what this movie gave me i could get from reading any other stephen king story or seeing any other movie adaptation of a king story so my review is mainly in backlash against this movies being regarded so highly but when it comes down to it as i said i enjoyed it and thought it was a five star movie  the notion that this movie belongs in the top 100 of anybodys list is simply retarded this b movie with an a movie list is standard run of the mill tv movie of the week fare how did it get this high whats wrong with the vast number of imdb users that they would vote so highly in favor of such a piece of trite my theory tim robbins is sending each of you a check thats the only explanation this movie offers nothing special nothing different nothing unique no great performances a phoned in morgan freeman performance akin to his deep impact presidential performance no graphic portrayals or stark realism of life behind bars nothing this movie achieves what few in history have done it both sucks and blows this is not a batman movie it is just wrong again with the realism batman isnt supposed to be realistic and when you make batman realistic it doesnt feel like batman anymore this movie is full of speeches all the joker does is vomit up dialogue he also doesnt even look like the joker the joker is supposed to use toy like gadgets and weapons not all real weapons now onto batman christian bale is once again terrible and is not fitting in the role his voice is the worst voice ever this also has to be the most overrated film of all time people rave that this is the best batman movie ever no it isnt this doesnt even feel or look like a batman movie this is even less creative than batman begins it is also even more boring i am so sad to see my favorite superhero be reduced to a growling dancing and uninteresting character nolan is to into making his batman films realistic that he forgets one of the most important that make a batman movie and that is creativity you have to be creative when making a film on any superhero especially batman it is just something that lacks in his batman films this is such a bad movieloved batman begins then it seems like christopher nolan lost his love if he ever had it for the source material i am a huge batman fan and will give any adaptation my full support i can usually get something out of it the more i watch the 2 dark knight movies the more i hate them and the more i think that nolan was never a batman fan the stories are poorly thought out but thats not exactly nolans fault its how he introduces our heroes and villains that make me question his passion for the projects in a scene that looks like it was shot by my older brother and his friends with a $40 video camera batman is introduced only after seeing a few pathetic batman copycats then we see him running through a parkade after a car he is indistinguishable at this point from the copycats not how i wanna be reintroduced to my favorite comic book character in a fluorescent lit parkade uncertain if its even him wheres the mystique wheres the darkness the mythos wheres the fear hes supposed to bring with him its all washed out the second bad entrance was with the most significant villain in comic book lore the joker i know everybody loves heath rip but i cannot approve of his portrayal firstly the joker the joker is introduced when he casually walks into a scene reminiscent of a scene out of dick tracy where a bunch of corny campy bad guys exchange dialogue in what is supposed to be a meeting of gothams underworld kings then some nobody strolls into this basement with his henchmen like a background character might does some tongue acting then puts the screws to the crime bosses with no opposition how did the joker even find out about this meeting and how was he allowed to waltz in with no charisma might i say wheres the evil wheres the man behind the face paint wheres the unbridled lunacy the key to a good villain is that you want to hate him but you cant help but love him i couldnt find the joker a joker any joker in any minute of ledgers performance his characters ability to predict the multitude of variables that had to occur for his plan to go off is unbelievable even for the truest of believers agent of chaos or not i need my joker to be somewhat grounded connected to something to have some motivation some cause for his direction ive already been lambasted by the people around me so i understand if this review will upset people im happy there are so many die hard passionate dark knight fans but i have to state what is so obvious to me shot for shot this is a train wreck oldmans comatose performance as gordon the purposeless tacked on fight scene near the end of the movie all of it just cant do it its plot is challenging in many ways absolutely stupid in most others no rendition will ever ruin batman for me but the follow up dark knight rises which i also hated cemented to me the lack of love on nolans partits an okay film epic and all of course the fact that its an epic like gladiator or troy doesnt mean its good troy proved that fact and alexander continued to prove it with one star antics to be quite frank peter jackson is an overrated director much like the lord of the rings movies are overrated movies if you notice all three are located in the top fifteen films this one happens to be ranked higher than greatly superiour films such as seven samurai schindlers list and even casablanca this is not the case with camera angles that make you sick utilising the admittedly beautiful landscape of new zealand to help push across into our heads the true epic feeling of middle earth but wait where are the interesting characters every one of them you feel so bored with by the time the first film is up you seem to hope that theyd be dead by the second one but no they come along to the third one to kick some sauron ass heres my view of lord of the rings a whole load of walking lord of the rings fellowship of the ring points there walks lord of the rings the two towers points there walks trips up walks on lord of the rings return of the king points there walks throws ring into mountain walks away take those completely identical scenarios and pile them up with useless plot for three to four hours per movie depending on which one you watch and i myself wouldnt touch the extended versions you really get the idea that the academy awards truly are flawed why look forrest gump won best film of 1994 instead of the shawshank redemption or pulp fiction titanic won best film of 1997 instead of la confidential and why lookey here lotr rotk won best ing film of 2003 instead of mystic river perhaps next year well have the constant gardener as the best film of 2005 that may actually redeem the oscars failing reputation a reputation that had truly fallen when they took this half arsed effort of a movie and worshipped it as best film  i loved batman begins it advanced from burtons shallow fun and brought him reality naturally i expected yet more from goyer and nolan boy was i wrong this movie is a nerdy fanboy jerk fest the hype it has received is so unjustifiable that it can only be the product of warner marketing and fanboy internet manipulation no film can go to #1 on imdb in 48 hours without prior orchestration while a final reckoning between batman and gothams lowest is inspired the story becomes a mess of plot lunacy the jokers great but i was dumbstruck to watch the camera suck off ledgers performance to wallpaper over plot chasms generally shallow characters and a complete lack of the dark knight himself where is batman in this movie he is nothing a playboy billionaire on a yacht who wrecks lamborghinis in a vain attempt to prove hes a hero he didnt prove it to me one shred batman begins reveals wayne as a tortured soul making the world a better place for the memory of his mother and father his moral code here was impossible to track he mocks other vigilantes with high school quips about hockey while they get murdered along with many for what they believe isnt what they believe what he believes claims he mustnt kill comic lore as its immoral but happily jams shut a police interrogation door so he can beat six bells out of the joker it seemed to me that gordon and dent with the placid ms dawes were in the moral front line while batman lurks in shadows all mr wayne contributes are ridiculous gizmos for epileptic action scenes batbikes tripping trucks like skywalker tripping an atat cell phones become security cameras gatling guns that rebuild bullets so we can scrutinise fingerprints for no good reason another bat suit lamborghinis & yacht lounging need i go on the worse effect of this is do you even need batman consider a film with gordon and dent fighting alone against the jokers criminal nihilism they battle and win only for dent to be consumed by his war against evil sounds good i was watching that fine movie until they wrote batman into it and when the batman spoke at all it was digitised alligator gruff tone that made me laugh the story ricochets everywhere hong kong a gotham come miami and through multiple plots until youre just enjoying the cinematography during another action yawn after two hours i could not care who did what or why least of all batman this film resembled an over hyped episode of 24 complete with real time waronterror inspirations to such a degree i wondered if jack bauer would make a better batman at least he would have been at the forefront of events a little more for a superhero the dark knight was an amoral superflop the culmination of this movies propensity for absurdity it the arrival of two face his injury from some of the jokers mountain of bombs is ridiculous no human being could come close to surviving this let alone check out of a hospital to roam the streets for revenge but it was done for the comic owners need to make the silly real for fans and ultimately thats what this film is about dark knights biggest error is its script editing it seems most of the writing is done by the nolan brothers with just minor input from goyer has the studio let the nolan boys run amuck every idea they have come up with or stole from 24 is crammed into this film until it explodes some dont rate goyer but he has more experience writing and may have controlled a few must be his the absurd elements and kept pacing sensible this film is also far detached from nolans previous work prestige momento and is either a poorly conceived sortie into action adventure on his part or the studios yanked the rug from under him it does appear warners sponging off ledgers unfortunate demise with him receiving triple screen time from batman bale also seems bored when he performs he has always liked deep complex characters to play so i suspect he was also unimpressed with the script batman begins was outstanding but imho the dark knight lets its predecessor down in spectacular fashion i wont say dont see it do and make up your own mind if you are one of the happy brain washed masses that love the dark knight because warner dc says you should then enjoy however i am not one of them sorry bat fans  in reality i give this film a score of 4 out of 10 but the one star rating you see above is intended to balance out the obvious shill vote marketing hype astroturf 10 10 votes and comments by paid for marketing weenies posing as real unbiased people at the time of this writing the film has a 97 out of 10 rating which it clearly does not in any sense deserve it merits half that rating i saw batman last night 25 hours meant that one gets ones moneys worth but heck its not half as good as advertisers and imdbcom would have us believe the plot line drags the characters are shallow the morality is deeply confused and wildly warped the dark knight is more like a dim bulb its hard to believe in heath ledger as the joker hes just too broad in the face one dimensional in this role and weighed down by poor writing his makeup was supposed to be degrading throughout the film but there were obvious touch ups and clean ups that reminded the audience this is make believe his garb was supposed to be purple on green but was so dark as to look like a black suit his actions were so reckless that we as an audience were constantly reminded that this aint even close to reality even a toddler wouldnt believe that this scheme would leave the joker alive and thriving worse were given zero back story to help us believe that the jokers feelings and craziness are based on something in fact the film goes far out of its way to emphasize that the joker has no past no legitimate reason for his hatred and aggression and is simply not understandable to that i say go back to scriptwriting school and take a few psychology classes while youre there a character isnt menacing or intriguing unless we see the mechanism driving the emotions worse christian bale as batman christian bale though good at dieting and working out has all the humanity and emotiveness of rotting firewood without a sound track sure hed do well as a male model as a actor though hes just taking up space on the screen worse his lisping with obvious sound effects to lower and strengthen his voice make him unbelievable as batman and as perfectionist billionaire commissioner gordon gary oldman gave an unemotive performance worse he seemed to be struggling with his accent so much that he had no time for other aspects of acting this is not the caliber of performance that he delivered for leon  the professional and bram stokers dracula this was an obvious potboiler walk on and take the money performance likewise for all the other performers except hyperactive heath ledger and a small one dimensional part played by the wife of one character i felt no emotion from any of the other actors and actresses despite the big ups and downs in the plot line dammit if your daddy dies or you quit your lifelong job youghta look a little broken up with two exceptions the special effects did nothing for me 1 i felt a bit of adrenalin when batman was standing on a ledge atop a skyscraper while the camera looked over his shoulder into the street 2 harvey two faces mask was well done that gets a thumbs up though i wouldnt want kids seeing it or theyll have nightmares a few scenes just left me scratching my head saying that would never happen thats beyond stupid even for a cartoon movie when batman glides down from one building on his wings darn it the wings should look full of air like a parachute not luffing like a sail pointed in the wrong direction even the love interest was a bit bland they found a frumpy not too pretty woman to play batmans love of his life and apparently asked her to play her role as though nothing romance impending death and explosions matters ive seen people react more strongly when they get the wrong kind of coffee from a starbucks > o the morality is twisted from a comic book one should expect flat one dimensional thinking from frank miller the talented artist but stupid ayn rand follower who wrote the comic book on which this film is based one should expect wildly offensive morality that would make even an idiot say wtf man rethink this the plot and characters will inevitably be compared to americas mccarthyist style war on terrorism and that just sickens me because i see the film try to justify a patronizing lying violent attitude from government and a billionaire everywhere in the film actors are saying this is wrong headed illegal untruthful patronizing to the citizenry and an abuse of power but were in a dark scary time so its ok for now art imitates life eh i felt deeply ill so far this summer hancock is the only superhero movie id endorse and that would only get a weak thumbs up its at least funny and does not try to paint a comic book morality as heroic so what should you see as an action popcorn movie this summer im wondering if the voyage to the center of the earth film or the new mummy film both starring brendan frasier will be a bit better or at least have a few funny lines the trailers though hint that theyll be campy and unbelievable  i have never understood why people love this movie so much it isnt a bad movie but it simply is not great yes i understand the plot no i dont like stupid romantic comedies or anything like like i am a big scorsese and oliver stone fan this movie is not terribly smart not violent in any way we havent seen before what this movie did is dress it up in hip clothes so high school kids and young adults would identify with it if you want gritty and smart watch a scorsese picture if you want over the top violence watch natural born killers if you want trendy and cool watch pulp fiction so i will keep this particular comment very brief yuck the worst movie ive ever seen not even excepting plan 9 from outer space which is at least so bad that its uproariously funny i so wanted to find anything in this movie that i could say something positive about racking my brain all i can come up with is this its been years since ive seen it and thinking about it even now kinda makes me want to puke my apologies to tarantino fansi have now put myself through the sometimes enjoyable but mostly painful experience of watching these three movies i have to say i do think the 3rd one was the best but lets be honest it didnt have much competition one thing is for sure this film and the trilogy as a whole is easily the most overrated event in history many films should be above this effort in the top250 the problems the plot for starters not only did it not make any sense it was basically after 9 hours about destroying a ring and fighting a couple of battles all the meaningless subplots and political gesturing really didnt add to the film the characters werent fleshed out at all even after 9 hours could you really mention much about any of the many characters as a result most of the time i couldnt care less about who was doing what and why for a film to be a classic surely it must have some surprises or must be original in some way and perhaps more importantly stir the juices of our soul all we had were some very good special fx and some nice new zealand scenery the filming was very much join the dots stuff nothing novel or clever it the way it was shown to the viewer do we really need to here the word `precious again and again do we really need to see yet another slow motion close up of frodos face all of this made the film and films over long and lacking in any substancethis is the worst movie ever it is so over rated one of the worst movies ever made 3 oscars are you kidding me more like 0 oscars why do people like this movie so much i guess all critics and 91 percent of people are dumb oh well as i was saying avoid this film at all costs al pacino and robert duvall are the worst actors ever and its so boring i fell asleep half way through it then i woke up it was still going i fell asleep again i woke up again and it was still going i know i already said this bt the godfather is the worst movie ever it was so bad that im just kidding its a classic its still over rated but thats not saying much 10 10i will never understand why pulp fiction is hailed by so many as one of the greatest films ever made quentin tarintinos first film reservoir dogs was amazing it had excellent performances some good action scenes an impressive structure and fantastic sound track when pulp fiction came out in my country in october 1994 i could not wait to see it empire magazine gave it 5 stars i remember when i went up to glasgow to see it with an anticipation i had not felt since i had went to see some thing like star wars or indiana jones oh boy twenty minutes in and i was already sick to death of samuel jacksons character he just talked and talked and talked andtalked john travoltas vince vega was a guy i wanted to decimate oh travolta you looked ridiculous with those hair extensions and then you talked and talked and talked with uma thurman in a silly black wig there was so much talking in this film that it made me want to walk out i have only ever done this once in my life and it was with that utter garbage jack nicholson flick wolf tosh so i kept hoping that something good would happenchristopher walken as an army bloke talking and talking about a gold watch up his assnot gooda male rape scene with talknot goodquentin tarintino turning up in a cameo that should have got him shot in real life talk talk about disposing of bodiesoh this film was the pits i must have been the only one in the audience that hated this film because everyone was whooping and hollering like they were watching a naked gun comedy oh yes they loved it quiet frankly my admiration of tarintino was gone forever he got his head together with the brilliant jackie brown then lost the plot again with the silly kill bill volumes pulp fiction is one of the worst movies ive ever had to endure its a long boring ride to a sore head compared to the original movie 1 no batman movie can beat the original batman 1989 2 theres not even a batwing and batmobile 3 heath ledger did a very good dark version of the joker but unfortunately there is no better joker than jack nicholson 4 danny elfman could not do a better job making the soundtrack 5 the 1989 batman main theme has an unforgettable recognizable classic 6 christian bales voice as batman is always grumbling which just sounds horrible every time he speaks 7 christian bales head wearing the batman mask does not even fit him looking ridiculous which he fails in the role of batman 8 original batmobile is a classic car vehicles used in the dark knight enormous large sized wheels under an ugly armored piece of steel 9 no batcave 10 christopher nolan youre out of order with these modern batman film series 1 out of 10 for the dark knight 2008 a ponderously slow moving script interspersed with vulgar blood and guts scenes after about 20 minutes of this tripe i wanted to drop a bomb in the middle and wipe out the whole lot of them for the good of humanity with few exceptions pacino the acting was also of low caliber all the money spent on the sets costumes and backdrops could not make up for the lack of any direction or purpose to the main storylineas a 19 yr old watching this film recently for my first time i simply cant see this film continuing to be considered the best film of all time yes the acting is good and the script is very smooth but there are large chunks of this film that can only be described as horribly boring nearly everyone i know in my generation agrees this is highly overrated so i think its only a matter of time before another film lifts it off top spot hopefully shawshank redemption although return of the king is more likely 4 10 the godfather is a terrible film its the worst movie ive seen in a decade the acting in this film is excruciatingly painful the whole family are watered down sopranos who show some phenomenally strong lack of chemistry the boring weeding scene is the highlight michael is a wet fish and his relationship with kay is very dumb and also stupid and weird the godfather scenes make me sick and woozy i havent seen such dramatized try to be cool dialogue since any given sunday pacino was less wooden in gigli that other film he also carried both puzo and brest were largely let down thanks to this tony montana the characters of sonny and fredo were so unrealistic i thought they were comic book i must also highly criticize the music in this film as being childish and sometimes often out of place now on to some other failings of this pathetic movie the dialogue was silly if it was supposed to be nail biting well it failed the manner in which the actors delivered their lines was uninspiring brando in particular sucked what about the long and tired sicily scenes reference to four hours of lawrence of arabia i dont know the car exploding was so unoriginal and clichÜ©d and the take over cross baptism montage come on do some cgi instead bah armatures how this is ranked above that masterpiece muriels wedding stumps me if they had replaced the old and tired francis ford with the more youthful nicolas they might have hit pay dirt okey i went to the cinema for this movie with the idea it was higher rated then the godfather and pulp fiction well i just registered to imdb to say i was very disappointed about this movie just because the flaws in the movie some here are some really stupid things in the movie 1 batman can bend a gun barrel whit his bare hands 2 dogs can chew true batman armour but bullets cant 3 the joker can do everything 31 he drives a school bus into a bank and drive away without being noticed by anyone and the bus had no scratch on it 32 he can get into everything even on a parade with 100 of cops and the cops just ignore him there not even thinking about where there colleges are but cops dont think in this movie they just panic when 1 guy takes a shot at the mayor 33 the hospital that is guarded by lot of cops joker just walked in the explosives are just there and he just walked out and blows the whole place up he gets on a school bus and vanished into fin air 34 he has tons of explosives on ferries that are heavily overcrowded 35 they lock him up with a personal guard but they also lock him up in a general jail did he wanted room service on his jail or was the personal guard to prevent him from getting bored but again cops are stupid in this movie i had a lot of moment in the movie with just shoot the joker gotham was not gotham but some city in the usa batcave was some to big ugly place under the ground with to many lights third degree burn wounds just put a blanked on it wait some days and its all good but ugly and god he was in pain i really noticed that balistic testing with some big ass gun why do you need a machine gun to fire 1 shot at a time for testing this movie is just bad but there some good things one is the joker was good he missed some good joker jokes but at least is was evil and really that the best thing i have to say about the movie i give it a 1 against all those who gave it a 10 normally i would give it a 6 10 this movie is overlong by at least a half hour i am so tired of films that have about six or seven endings its become a bit of a clichÜ© just when you thought it was safe to get up from your seat and start filing out of the theater another epilogue begins and youre forced to sit through at least another ten minutes of ridiculous overblown pretentious blather thats been well covered in the previous four or five epilogues some writer directors just dont know when to say when and thats usually a sign that they dont have confidence in their material nor their approach to it this movie is a prime example of that kind of narrative drawback but thats just the beginning of my complaints about the dark knight loud obnoxious puerile without one whit of wit this movie also represents the extreme destructiveness of a relentless hype machine thats intent on whittling down our collective sense and sensibilities the acting which ranges from wooden to hyperbolic seems as if its being carried out by inter planetary aliens who have no idea what its like to be human the script sounds as if it was written by someone who barely made it out of bone head freshman composition ive never heard or seen so many clichÜ©s strung together in a misguided attempt at profundity and universality as each new clichÜ© ridden set piece followed another i began to feel beaten down as if my defenses against such obvious manipulation were being fed upon by my own desire to enjoy what everyone else seemed to be accepting so readily fortunately my will to survive such cultural mediocrity is strong and i was able to withstand this latest onslaught with my dignity intact please understand i enjoyed batman begins a story that was told in a simple straightforward manner with some minor attempts at profundity that were in line with the childish comic book subject matter to try and make something so de profundis about a superhero running around in a bat costume chasing down some uber villain in grease paint and fright wig is truly akin to putting lipstick on a pig after its done you cant help but wonder are they really expecting people to take this crapola so seriously id rather see adam west and cesar romero go at it then have to sit through this load of pretentious horse manure at least i was able to get a laugh out of the original tv series which was undeniably a camp classic in its original incarnation  granted im not a huge splosion fan but walking out of the theater after just seeing this film i am appalled i feel like a roman who has just witnessed a tiger maul a man why wasnt this rated r why do we as a society think movies like this are amazing let alone acceptable i am an english teacher the symbolism and social commentary were not lost on me but at what point are dramatically violent scenes in a movie ultimately contributing to more violence in our communities what price do we pay as a society to entertain our growing need to witness this level of destruction using school buses to rob banks and murder blowing up hospitals pointing guns to childrens heads this has gone past harmless entertainment particularly when its witnessed by younger children there were a number of 6 9 year old boys in my showing that ended at midnight needless to say i will not be seeing a third installment of the franchise and will be encouraging people at least the last five on the planet who havent seen it to avoid this filmthis is one of the worst movies ever made if you think that it will be as good a the original i urge you to never watch this heaths over the top ridiculous performance as the joker was not oscar worthy but they gave it to him because he died and robbed him in brokeback mountain the use of the harvey character was pathetic and christian bale is one of the wost actors to ever play batman his bruce wayne is the only redeeming quality of the movie other than gary oldman as commissioner gordan the whole movie is trying to be more epic than it is and this leads to a terrible storyline and pathetic use of special effects i would recommend watching the original batman with michael keaton any day dont waste your time with this crap written by nolan he is a hack unless you like batman sounding like he is satan dont watch this filmi dont want to waste more time on writing the review for this stupid movie as i have already wasted my precious time watching it this movies is over hyped con imdb gives it 92 i mean are you serious lolreally this is the biggest joke ever that an awful movie like this gets 92 direction is mediocre the hissing voice of batman is annoying it was supposed to sound intimidating and macho but it sounds as if he is having laryngitis instead joker was he really the joker who never laughs a joker is a character who is supposed to be full of surprises and tricks and most important the one who laughs in paradoxical situations unfortunately this joker was not even close to the actual joker character it seems as if joker controls the whole city but how and when god knows i cant go without mentioning that hyper sonar machine that can see every single person in the city this time the director really jumped out of his briefs you evacuate all the hospitals in the city except for the person for whom you are doing the evacuation lolwho was the writer i guess he didnt reach school higher than 2nd grade i have so much to say about this stupid movie but again as i have already promised that even reviewing this stupid movie is wastage of time so in the end this is the worst movie i have ever seen which paradoxically gets the best ratingive never seen batman beginsbut my friends told me id get the dark knight anywaythey were way wrong this movie has either no plot at all or a plot so complex that the average person wont get it at all whats up with the mob thing it was never explained it any way shape or form and the movie was thrown into chaos so quickly that i sat through the whole 2 and a half hours of it trying to figure out what the heck was going on my friends told me that the first one was so much better but i dont know if i even want to see it after this pathetic attempt at a movie if your looking for something to see skip the dark knightand see mamma mia now thats a movie everyone would absolutely lovethe dark knight is a good action movie that features tightly crafted action sequences and it boasts a decent story to tie it all together sadly though the story is still drawn out like all comic book movies the acting also is very bland with only heath ledger morgan freeman and michael caine performing well the direction is solid and nolan has learned from his mistakes in batman begins to say the least though the film needed a better editor as the film kind of drags on past its expiry date for a movie this long it needed a really good story but it lacked it and the ending is terrible overall though its a good film just not one of the best of 2008 itll be a fun movie to see for a night but the dark knight wont have you looking back on it as a classicif i could give this movie less than a 1 i would certainly do that i had read and heard so much about it that i was sure this would be a defining work of numbing minds to make a bad story look good with cheap tricks i was game and we thought it cant be as bad as the critics said you know critics sure enough give me a break with the awful acting ok excluding heath horrible camera work poor use of the budget that has been mentioned over and over again ive seen better on films with smaller budgets that are 100 times better its the director and the producer that makes films work they choose the teams thats it if they dont put it together and make it workit simply wont so they didnt and it doesnt worst part is that i know this group can do good work i just had to take the time to write this reviewthough im sure the film crew and the half crazed fans doesnt appreciate this review i hope im doing you all a favor with my wish for you to do well good luck final word the polar opposite of batman begins awesomeness indulge me for a second here imagine that youre a studio executive and someone is pitching the movie to you and heres what he says all right my movies based on old comic books and is set in a fictional city in it theres going to be a rich guy who goes around fighting crime while dressed like a bat because his parents died and then theres going to be this other guy who for no given reason dresses up like a clown acts creepy and goes around killing people the bat dressing person is going to go around trying to defeat him by beating people up with his bare hands meanwhile theres this other guy whos a perfectly nice lawyer but then his face gets burned so he decides to kill people based on this random coin that he has it sounds kind of funny and interesting to you but just as youre accepting it the person suddenly coughs under his breath oh yeah and im going to take it seriously like it was shakespeare and make it so depressing that it actively hurts the audience im not sure if thats exactly how the meeting proposing this movie went but it seems to be a reasonable guess lets face it the whole story of this movie is patently ridiculous it could not be more unrealistic if there were space aliens involved and yet its still treated here as if we should be taking it as a serious parable of modern life and that it should be used as a way to push really depressing messages across how does a guy who beats people up while in a bat suit teach us about what kind of justice is realistic and effective what does a weirdo in a clown suit teach us about the nature of evil why would anyone be proud that they kept campiness out of this despite the fact that it is a campy movie give me the days of adam west at least his show made me happy rather than depressed  the only list this movie should be at the top of is most overrated when i wasnt dozing off i was hoping a fire alarm would evacuate the theater i wont jump on the heath bandwagon because hes six feet under he was average to quote another review if heath gets nominated for an oscar i will never watch another hollywood movie again plot holes the size of the grand canyon overall terrible acting and about 45 minutes of useless fluff at the end had this been the real world the joker would have been caught about 15 minutes into the movie and the credits would have rolled too bad that didnt happen i will not be seeing the next batman in the theater that i can guarantee my husband and i waited hours to see this movie my stepson loves all the old batman series and we do too to finally find a few seats in the third row what a disappointment for 45 minutes we endured bad action scenes with no apparent plot the jokers makeup was cool but we were not impressed with batman his voice was like he was speaking from one of those box things for guys with throat cancer i also wasnt impressed with the technology of the batman suit i guess our expectations were just too high to be fair we may try renting the movie another time and sitting through the whole thing in the distant futurei dont mean to hurt the feelings of fans of this movie but i simply hated this movie i only understood and was interested in it for about a half an hour then i got extremely bored the movie is extremely confusing and overrated i only got into the action for one scene in this whole movie seriously since people were sad about heath ledgers death they all gave it high ratings in order to get it into the top 250 and #7 man society today has changed drastically go watch the batman movies with michael keaton and batman forever do whatever you can to avoid this trash despite its extremely high undeserved rating 1 10 or fi meanthis is the best movie everthe number 1is it better than the godfather or braveheart i think not people are talking a lot about heath ledgers performancebut in my opinionjack nicholson was a much better jokerbecause he had a twisted sense of humor and a background that the viewer could relate withthis new joker is just a sick individual with no clear motivation and an absurd point of view shall the academy give an oscar to ledgerwho careseverybody knows who are going to be the winners months before the ceremonyand i wouldnt be surprised if this stupid action flick won best moviebest director and all the other oscars batman should be made for children to see ithow is that possiblethis as an ultra violent movie with batman being a torturer in some scenes some people give the godfather 1 star and this bizarre experience 10what is the world becomingdoes special effects and bizarre characters make a good moviethe best one everonly for the small minded the good old days are overand with this turd on the top of the listimdb looses all the credibilityif the corleones were living in gotham this joker wouldnt last a day uhauhauahauuahuaim giving the dark knight a 1 to lower its overall rating this movie was good but it wasnt great when i think of great movies ive seen this one would definitely not pop into my head first off christian bale is not that great as batman he seems corny and a little to cocky and is nerdy to me actually made the movie worse and what was with the nasally voice what like everybody seeing half of the guys face doesnt give it away but he has to hide his voice second yes heath ledger passed away right after the movie and had the best performance in the movie and is a great actor besides the point but to be honest lets not discredit danny devito what an amazing performance he did as the penguin in batman returns and one of the most underrated actors ever speaking of batman returns i actually love the movie and thought it was allot better than the dark night and i think michael keaton is a much better actor than christian bale and was allot cooler batman the worst performance in the movie was maggie gyllenhaal what a boring dull acting job she put on i dont know if its just her personality but she was not very good and didnt seem like the effort was there and again i thought michele feifer did a much better acting job and was awesome as catwomen all in all this movie was at best a tiny bit above average i think that star wars episode v the empire strikes back bis the worst movie i had ever watched although i have only watched it one time i really do not like this movie for several reasons first the movie does not have a proper ending it just stops when all the battles have finished and do not explain any other things after the battle instead it only shows a shot of the characters looking out the window this really disappoints me second about the love between princess leia and han solo i have never thought that leia and han solo are a couple until they suddenly kiss it makes me feel very surprised because the movie does not show any obvious relation between them third the movie does not tell story but showing a battle sequence instead it is very boring for audience to watch finally the battle of luke and darth vader did not bring out a mood of climax but instead it makes me think that it is ridiculous these are the reasons why i dont like this movie i want to be as honest as possible in my review of this film i comment on this movie as i feel outraged that it has been given such a high rating on imdb first my credentials as a fair and impartial reviewer i am a native new zealander my mum new peter jackson well & i quite enjoyed his early films bad tastethe frighteners heavenly creatures & particularly brain dead some of the movie sets were just a few miles from my house and i had the opportunity to work as an extra on the trilogy and all were treated graciously additionally i was a huge fan of tolkiens book and had a sense of excitement and wonder that the lord of the rings was to be made into 3 films in my home country many of the bad reviews posted here compare the book to the movie and the movie will always come off worse and i must admit that when i saw the fellowship i was horrified at how bad and boring it was compared to the book but come two towers i came with an open mind and quite enjoyed the film judging it on its own merits and i had the same plan going into the return of the king additionally i must admit there were a few parts of the return of the king that i thoroughly enjoyed the lighting of the torches the juxtaposition of the brave warrior riding of to almost certain death to please and prove himself to his father while dad casually feasts on grapes supported by a beautiful song the scene where the kingdom bow down to salute the brave hobbits also the brothers acting was fine aannndd thats about it this movie was awful for me first and foremost because it did not draw me in to the story for only seconds at a time did i care for or could i make sense of the story and the acting i was simply bored and restless some of the reasons for this follow the length 3 hours + + peter have you heard about the innovations in film editing and what is with the multiple endings it was like one of those nightmares where you wake up but you are really still in the dream and cant seem to get out i believe a natural ending would have been with the salute to the hobbits frodo oh nodo frodo wore only one expression on his face for the entirety of two towers and the majority of fellowship and return you know that look of pained resignation of sore weariness all those head shots kind of got boring also i just did not buy him turning on his loyal companion sam taking the rascally creatures word over his additionally having struggled so long and hard being so pure of heart for the whole journey you just suddenly decide you want to keep the ring at the last moment cmon sam smithersthe part where frodo sends you away and you start to cry i wish i could erase the pained forced feeling of that scene from my memory warrior woman i cant remember whether it was in the book or not but the ease with which you dispatched an enemy far more powerful than you or just about anyone for that matter seemed a little unlikely it bet daniel sons victory over a vastly superior opponent in kk3 hands down hordes of the undead those ghostly figures aragon summoned um it wasnt too suspenseful for me seeing them do battle since they were invincible and could not be attacked back legolas a shame to see the kick arse archer from fellowship & towers reduced to a one very fake looking scene taking down the baddies on the elephant dwarf i like a dwarf to be ascetic and noble not comic relief aragon why did you change your voice tone and go all james l brooks on us when giving your coronation speech my friend suppressed a laugh karl urban there was an excellent scene in the trailer where you screamed and wailed at the sky below your father the kings body lying dead on the earth that scene really got my heart racing i cant believe it was absent in the movie the battles who was fighting who the editing was such that i couldnt see which characters to root for as the action flied by too quickly and clumsily golem we get that the ring has corrupted your soul and turned you into something horrible over the years we get that you will make a play for the ring before the film is out was the opening scene biography really necessary finally and by far most disgracefully please keep in mind that all three films were filmed at the same time using the same actors production crew and locations the first two movies got just a few oscar nods in minor categories such as sound effects editing how can return of the king be that much better than the other two that it sweeps up 13 or so oscars everything for which it was nominated shame on you academy my guess is that the money from new line cinema was not all spent on making and advertising the film itself bouycott the oscars the expectations that were built up by the first film and the second allthough slowed down really plunged down into the lava of mnt doom with this one it really makes you nauseous thinking about everything that is wrong in this film im not talking about the extended version that one is a lot better but still far from perfect and how everything could have been where should i start its overly sentimental i mean really and i like that s usually im a sentimental guy but here its really out of proportion and out of timing oh its really sad when faramir rides to meet the orcs when he has no chance of winning while pippin is singing som silly song like hes castrated and then breaks out and cries just like that bu hu this is a mythological style heroic fantasy tale not titanic everybody are so overly emotional and i dont even wanna talk about sam and his constant speeches about bravery and not giving in with the hand on the chest looking out over the horizon with the orchestra at full volume the only thing missing is the american flag bellowing in slowmotion behind him and frodo and his constant twisting your head like a puppy and looking with big eyes and a oh i love you so much smile at sam every time he saves him or helps him to keep going ok im getting carried away i liked braveheart for example even though it has some major flaws and people think that one is overly sentimental but that one is at least down to earth sentimental rotk is up in the sky almost gone out to space like i thought id never say this but it seems they producers crew and actors really take the film too serious really its a saga not true its a 20th century made up mythology history about an imaginary land its not a record of the holocaust for christs sake i understand how they needed to cut some scenes to save up time but well first of all they didnt succeed enough with that the films are 2 3h long and still it feels youre rushing from one place to the next like youre on a middleearth 8hour safari or cinematic tourbus maybe they shouldve cut it even more so we could at least get the feel of being someplace and not just passing by but whats really unacceptable is when he wastes all that preciously gathered time on exploring uninteresting or unimportant scenes and scenes that dont even belong in the story completely made up scenes for no logical reason the ugly made up bull rhinoceros beasts pulling orc wagons whatta f is up with that i dont even know if george lucas would accept such a badly designed creature in the star wars universe the really awful orc liutenant chief guy whos by the way made up out of thin air who doesnt even look like an orc but more like the aliens from peter jacksons early lowbudget cult films mr jackson this is not the time and place to have cameos or draw funny parallells to your bad taste films thats really bad taste disrespectful to the tolkien fans the mÜémaks are really cool but really too big i mean theyre not dinosaurs beasts heyre just big elephants all the small details costumes and armour etc are really beautiful really more than you could ever ask for but the white dwarf miniature esthetics of minas tirith is really bad cause it gives a whole synthetic comic book computer game look to middleearth where are the beautiful classical and authentic designs of edoras and rivendell and no catapult can throw rocks as big as whole houses that too is just corny and childish like in computergames all this and the excessive use and naive belief in cgi technology turns the battle of pelenoor fields which should be the total culmination and action peak of the film into a foney uninteresting starwars warhammer40000 mess its nothing compared to the battle of helms deep and thats not right and this cgi trend seems to be a virus infecting everybody in the film business its really sad these films will be outdated in 10 years but maybe thats a good thing rotk isnt the worst of the three technically but with the expectations you have from the first two the books if you know whats gonna happen the demands should be pretty high and in my opinion too especially after the hint in 2towers that the trilogy was going downhill just like the matrix this is the film that disappoints the most rotk is the greatest and heaviest of the films the first two would completely crumble under its weight if it didnt hold but they could also rise with it if it really grew as strong as it couldve and that is what it should have anything else is unacceptable to me and this is also why i hate it cause it really doesnt live up to its potential it doesnt even outdo the 2towers and it doesnt live up to the old exited expectations you had from the first film i cant understand how a new zeelander who used to make underground films could turn this old british tale into shimmering hollywood cheese its too pretty too pompous and sentimental and all the computer graphics gives it lika a fake sugarcoated shine or crust its like food add too many ingredients and spices and theyll take out each other and the dishll just taste bland its just too much of everything and the whole film falls flat its still stunning but rather tasteless and the only profound experience you might get from it comes soely from the overwhelming magnitude of the whole thing i still wanna congratulate pjackson on successfully bringing this gigantic project home thank him even if hes made me more irritated than delighted cuz im still glad that im able to watch these films he didnt deserve all those oscars but he definitely deserved a few maybe not for directing but for best film for the production but this film should not be ranked as the best fantasy film of all time sebastianbad bad bad it is such a shame that this movie is so bad it really has the potential to be great but no no no the first two movies were okay but this last one really sucked and yet everybody are joining this mass hysteria over this really really bad movie i just cant understand why a movie with really bad special effects and really bad acting bad directing but a great story can be the winner of 11 oscars the world has truly gone mad and to add it as the second best movie based on votes from users its sad just sad there are tons of movies that are better and this really is the movie that would never end very long ending 30 minutes of fading and ending only to not really end bearf i think people are mistaking the movie for the book sad a few spoilers below i remember seeing this movie at a theater when it was first released i was very excited and eager to see it as i had heard a lot of positive buzz about it i was very disappointed for many reasons including 1 glorification of violence all the cool characters are cold blooded murderers drug abusers or sadists i cannot identify or become emotionally involved with these type of characters i didnt care if any of the main characters lived or died in fact i would have preferred if they all died in the end because they were all terrible excuses for humans 2 attempting to mix realistic violence with humor in the scene where the guy was accidentally shot in the back seat of the car a few people around me laughed others gasped that someone would laugh i will never forget the guy in the theater sitting behind me saying out loud wait thats funny right isnt that supposed to be funny many action films have cartoonish violence its understood that the violence is farcical this movie seemed to be saying murder and rape are funny and cool 3 the scene with the gimp was way over the top not necessary and sadistic again is this supposed to be amusing and entertaining 4 the dialog seemed to be random and unconnected and without purpose people cite lines about mcroyal with cheese like it is profound is it me am i missing something 5 you have to completely suspend your disbelief at the coincidences that occur a guy is driving on a random street and happens to pull right up next to the guy trying to kill him i am at a loss as to why this movie is rater so high it had some snappy editing and a few genuinely humorous moments but is was a film about nothing but a fictionalized underbelly of society  holy smokes this has got to be one of the most pointless trilogies ive ever seen i do not even know how it scored this high there was nothing that made it stand out at all throughout the 9 excruciating hours of watching frodo turn into a mentally disoriented fool i cannot recount a single moment in time where i said wow thats interesting first off the plot is simply unenjoyable it has no twist no character building and for gods sake its about a possessive ring watching the characters go through pointless trials to burn a single ring is not something i can find appealing in fact i was ready to watch any of these uptight hobbits meet their end that is a huge problem in this series not one character was tragically killed in the midst of any orc battle ok there was that no name in the fellowship of the ring but the audience didnt give a damn as to what was going on with him what made me even more angry was that these fools looked almost invincible when legolas and gimli were slaying orcs left and right as easily as brushing snowflakes away i was ready to step out of the theater i can see why people liked this movie the action was indeed thrilling and had great deal of special effects thrown into it i remember legolas first arrow being launched smoothly into an orc what a marvelous scene then i looked and he was launching another arrow in a similar fashion then another one and another one sure it looked great but it was so repetitive i got bored every battle in this movie is almost exactly the same swords swinging arrows launching and people screaming i just cant see what was so special about it i also could not get through my head the final battle scene honestly an army of the undead destroying the orc forces gee that must have been a difficult victory it was so predictable and unfair i simply hated this movie for all of the action attempts and turning a really old trilogy into a movie i was considering giving this film two stars but then i remembered the conclusion frodo and sam were being saved by a bunch of hawks or something and everything seemed to be at peace not a bad ending then the story stretches into farewells and goodbyes good luck and god bless ok i can tolerate this now bilbo is going into a boat and heading off to god knows where when is this bloody movie going to end by the time i got out of the theater it was nearly half an hour after the part where the movie would have made an effective conclusion my behind sweating like an oxen from boredom i would definitely not recommend this movie to anyone unless you are amazed by a couple of special effects i dont know how this movie did so well i think one critic said it was a good movie and it spread like wildfire or maybe there was simply nothing else to do but worship elves whatever the reason i do not want to see this ever again first i thought that the men who stare at goats was bad and than i saw this very bad movie i dont care how many people gave it a 10 dont know why i want to write my opinion it is long boring a lot of talking a lot families names doing buissnes did i mention that it is boring the movie lacks a good storyline it doesnt matter how good the actors are if the movie is not interesting at all there is no comedy there is very little action drama here and there somebody gets killed i had better fun watching politicians than this i just wasted 6 hours of my life together with the second part better watch scarface casino or reservoir dogs my other movies are braveheart gladiator shawshank lethal weapon black hawk down im voting and commenting about this film just to bring it down from its pedestal and invite everyone to do the same i have nothing against italians the mafia or any of the principals but best film ever never it was an entertaining film which displayed some rather ridiculous acting in a gross piece of defamation perpetrated on the italians i have nothing again violence and gore even sex on screen when appropriate but this is a ludicrous consensus your readership has reached and it must be correctedtalk about a lousy movie this one was ridiulous i couldnt understand it at all i only watched half of it [the part with bruce willis] and soon as that was over i re wound it talk about a waste of good moneyand why would all the actors in this movie want to be associated with such junk what were they thinking it sure confused the heck out of me thats for sure i cant see what the big deal was with this sorry excuse for a movie it is a waste of film and a waste of the actors times as i see it i would advise someone not to use their hard earned money on this drivel rent something else instead of this turkey  perhaps i cant lay all the blame on peter jackson the story was dumb to begin with for those that dont know the idea of the ring originates from platos the republic the ring of gyges basically this ring gives gyges the power of invisibility which he exploits to take over some kingdom and yada yada not a very interesting story on its own but good within the context of the republic glaucon and plato were arguing over the tendency of man to do good over evil and vice versa lotr does not intertwine philosophical explorations with a clever plot instead it merely takes this stupid ring story out of its origin and assumes that is insightful blah this is why i rarely akin to fantasy its authors are prone to employing cheap fiction thanks for making america even dumber peter jackson never make another movie please a very good movie this isbut one sees overtime that pulp fiction may be the most overrated movie of all time tarantino makes movies for teenagers and in the process takes what he does from other great directors and packages it as his own this may be a great movie but no though tarantinos film may have achieved greatness this not the 9th greatest film of all time good tarantino may be but as good as he is he is twice as much a narcissistic arrogant loquaciousbad man what i mean is i wouldnt spend my time with tarantino not so much because i dont like him but because i cant stand the smell of his fans and the rest of his crony balogni phonies everyones saying this overrated film is one of the greatest films of all time  nope im saying its groundhog day why because that one is a good film with meaning creativity fun likability and enjoyment unlike this it makes you want to do fun things like it features when watching it watching the godfather i feel no i dont want to do or watch these things most of this film is rather just boring & confusing everything is shot in the dark or with a dark filter you have to make sure youve got something else to do while viewing this masterpiece its way too long and its certainly not flawless  ive spotted a whole bunch of flaws with this flick that theyd have to be put into many notes remember no film is without flaws a summary of the flaws with this film are confusing story lines corrupt characters crime violence some filthy language bad attitudes even the false cult of catholicism being featured rudeness mind aching distressing corrupt plot inconsistencies or scenes that just dont make sense or just annoy the bazzerk out of you i couldnt care less if almost all critics everywhere have given it glowing reviews i dont care if its generally considered a masterpiece and i dont care if it has a 92 out of 10 on imdb i cant believe i fell for such a deceiving look im sad that theyve refused to see how horrible it is the fact is films have quite the tendency to be either underrated or overrated these days seriously this should be turned around all the attention towards the godfather series should be given instead towards groundhog day  all the awards given to the godfather series should be instead towards groundhog day its that good please check it out and plus marlon brandos brought into this flick and given one of the stupidest accents in film history sounding so nauseated and drunk with his chin thrust out so far it makes me think hes turning into jim carrey this films also one of the biggest reasons why i dont care about al pacino as an actor how he almost always seems to have a fetish for hardcore violence swearing and playing all round unromantic unpopular and unlikable characters undoubtedly it was this flick that started a whole film career of mistakes for al pacino i guess hes kind of cool just not as much as people make him to be though to be fair i do give credit to this film for not including one f bomb at all but overall i think this is certainly one of the worser movies i have seen and im glad i didnt watch it growing up 2 10 ps im a movie buff who tries to like every film i seei am baffled by the users who rate this film so highly if one deleted the n word and the f word there would be no script how can we expect young viewers to treat people respectfully when hollywood bombards us with racial slurs yes life imitates art although calling this movie art is a stretch i read that tarrantino is a high school drop out must be true judging from this script i am certainly no prude or a stranger to adult themes and language however the script was filled with glorified drug use and violence yet failed to show one ounce of character growth the barrage of profanity and violence was both offensive and boring quentin tarrantino movies are on my list of films to avoid waste of timeokay this is a pretty good movie but i just find it hard to see it in the top five thus the low score although it certainly has a lot of great things about it there is a great deal wrong with it as well which i suppose must be expected from a film that is trying to condense 500 pages of literature into over three hours it must first be said that this clearly too long or at least there are points in the film were it does seem to lumber along it also seems that jacksons choice in which parts of the film were to remain in the final cut left out a great deal of interesting stories from the books and the ending is completely different to that of the book and unnecessary that said it is still an incredible achievement overall with excellent battle scenes and amazing effects surrounding an already lovable story but i still wish jackson had made more use of the characters its a great film to watch for sure much better then a lot of the stuff were seeing now but it still could have been a great deal better after seeing the rating it got on here on imdbcom and hearing from different people who had seen it i was very exited when i saw it was being shown on television it began quite well and some parts were actually good but in after half the movie it got worse and worse freemans role was one of the most irritating marlabo man stereotypical pseudo intellectual characters ive ever had the displeasure of seeing on my television even the green mile was a better movie 3 10 for acceptable actor performances well i really hope one flew over the cuckoos nest will be more interesting else i lost all hope for prison films golly everyone is falling all over themselves about this one why please its silly violent nihilistic pointless and every character has the same way of talking talking about clever things in that pseudo way that only quentin could possibly dream up ooooooh the talent passregardless of what great actors and actresses were in this movie i found it to be very repulsive the dungeon scene was something that should have been shown on mississippi burning only they had the decency not to go there all in all this movie was difficult to follow and i consider myself an intelligent person violence and filthy language taken to an extreme is how i would characterize this one there should be two imdb top 250 films one for zombies and another for people with functioning brains who are the dipshts that voted this crap to the #5 on the top 250 films list i tried reading the reviews the positive reviewers couldnt point to any specific reason for liking this film meanwhile the negative reviewers could point to clear and specific reasons for hating this trash i suspect hollywood is trying to turn us into mindless morons this movie was made up of tarantinos brain puke the dialog was clever several times throughout the whole movie the other 98% of the dialog caused me much suffering it was like reading a 10000 page book to find a paragraph of information its not just that the dialog was mind numbingly irrelevant but it was criminally long and served to transport the audience from one aimless scene to the next i think ill write a script about a guy who lost 25 hrs of his life watching a crap movie and then seeks revenge on the writer director ill call it pummel tarantino  i was hyped to watch this i thought it would be great but it left a lot of unanswered questions floating in my head more like the whole movie all this movie is about it people snorting drugs getting killed and all the rest of the sucktacularity who are these characters why do they think theyre angels why does quentin cameo in the movie why are there gay cops ive seen death proof and thought it was spectacular i dont know why everyone thinks this is so great the characters have no personality the movie seemed like it left you to make the story full circle some movies do that and achieve it but this one makes me feel to be asking questions rather than answering them bottom line terrible movie 1 10  this flick was about 15 hours too long there was more wasted time and film in this installment and none of it added anything to the production this film certainly did not deserve any of the awards that it received thankfully elijah wood only has about 25 minutes of screen time total for the entire film im so glad this trilogy is over i am also glad that i didnt go see this flick at the theater i would have felt even worse had i spent 9 bucks on a ticket for this extended play boredom fest even at 299 the dvd rental was too much at least i was able to make my own intermissions no film should be this long i cant recommend this flick for anything but an aid for when you cant get to sleep this was a three and a half hour passing of a gall stone shame on the academy for showering this tragic effort with so much gold why are people trying to make this film out to be something it is not this has got to be one of the worst films i have ever seen i mean come on what a load of tripe i could get more enjoyment out of watching the erotic witch project 2 although i have to admit is pretty classy the acting is superb well done girls you really do look and sound like you are cuming there where is all the action the makes a mafia film class like goodfellas marlon brandos acting didnt deserve an oscar it deserved a slap in the face sean connerys performance as a spaniard in highlander was more convincing al pacinos performance is total rubbish the only good part he can do is a queer and thats in dog day afternoon as and for the director paul verhoeven did a better job with showgirls what is wrong with a bit of rape in a film this is the mafia we are watching on the screen if they are going to portray what the mafia are really like then at least show what they do behind closed door very poor 1 out of 10possible spoilers i did have high hopes for this film because its at number one on this chart but after about 40 minutes into it i think its the most boring film i have ever watched in my mind its just a bunch of people talking total nonsense all the time and how on earth marlon brando got a best actor oscar for what seems to be 10 minutes on screen time i will never know the only scene i liked from this movie is in the cafe i think it is when michael kills those two people in order to even the score for his father and to be perfectly honest about 1 hour and 10 minutes into the movie i decided to stop watching it otherwise i would have thrown myself out the window thats how bad this movie is to me i did try to like it but you cant please all of the people all of the time can you and the last thing i want to say is that if this film was so bad i would dive off a cliff rather than see its sequel in my personal opinionwell as all of the tolkiens books are nothing more than some dumb fairy tales any movie based on tolkiens book is gonnawell jay and silent bob fans you know the quotei dont like but i tolerate fanatsy in gerenal but this is by far anyone who likes sitting and watching orcs and goblins speaking single minded lines about some trashcan worth ring for 2 hours are welcome any sane person keep out 0 10 people who know and study film will all have the same basic review of this movie its overacted and yes heath ledger is included in that remark and just an overall horrible script the whole why so serious bit was again overacted and so predictable i wrote better dialogue when i was a toddler then comes the completely unfathomable events nolan wanted the movie to be realistic but he clearly is a moron for that statement because only pre teens and people pretending to go along with the hype would believe the whole cell phone bomb inside a guys stomach and a gun in court come one stop insulting me the fact that this movie is anywhere in the top 250 proves that people are generally stupid  as far as cinematographic masterpieces this is not one this movie is not in a the same league as movies such as the shawshank redemption or schindlers list it is enjoyable but only the last half the first half plays to be predictable and foolish when i go see a batman movie i want to see an entertaining flick not one trying desperately to be deep heath ledgers joker is a joke he will not win an oscar for this and he shouldnt be nominated any one who has read the comic books knows the joker is not scared because of a knife wound he does not try to mask his appearance with makeup nolans idea of a distraught application is myopic the reason the joker has a more colorful appearance is due to an accident involving acid which bleached his face and colored his hair and lips batman begins is much better and a more entertaining way to spend your time  this has got to be one of the worst movies i have seen in a long time the dialog was often difficult to hear especially batman who for some unknown reason seemed to be suffering from laryngitis because of the dark nature of the movie it was often far too dark to see what was happening all which meant that the plot was far more difficult to follow since the days of adam west we have seen several different batmen not least val kilmer and michael keaton to name two who were far better at it than christian bale as for heath ledger i thought his character was so over played that he stole the show so to speak but as for awarding him a posthumous oscar well thats another matter and i personally dont think so i cannot believe someone would call this movie great i would give it a 3 but the fact it is the highest rating movie ever on this site makes me go crazy how pathetic can this be this is the most overrated movie ever created made with a low budget it seems all that happens is a guy that went to prison gets raped several times escapes and meets his friend from prison back when he was out ending 99% of the movie was made in prison where all that happened was he gets raped and washes some clothes seriously how can you even compare this near to godfather dark knight etc and the bad director just killed himself at the end his wife gets killed he isnt even sad about it 20 years in prison has some money not that much and is happy how nice this film is nothing but one cliche after another having seen many of the 100s of prison films made from the early 30s to the 50s i was able to pull almost every minute of shawcrap from one of those films while it is visually well made and acted the story has every plot point of the standard prison film they have the evil warden innocent main character friendly guilty guy thugs and one good old prisoner dont waste your time on this one rent or buy some of the classics of the prison genre  obviously i missed the point of this movie after years of people telling me how fantastic it was and noting how high it regularly comes in opinion polls i finally watched it recently somehow i seem to have come to completely the opposite conclusion to almost everyone else maybe my expectations were too high but i was very very disappointed the plot was predictable and dull the directing pretty droll not much else i can say about it other than to ask people if i have missed something key that would alter my perception of this film who am i to go against the vast popularity of this picture i must be the exception that proves the rule this apparently is a must see movie i really tried to watch this movie i enjoyed the first scene and that was about it after the first scene or so i was so annoyed i could not follow this movie to save my life i was utterly confused and annoyed most of the time i have never in my life seen so much dialog in a batman movie where has batman gone where has the joker gone hands down this was the worse to make matters worse this was the looooooooooooooongest movie i have ever had to sit through the movie was totally boring furthermore i cannot believe that so many people liked this movie it seems that 90% of you loved the movie and 10% of us hated the movie this movie really really really suckedi have never watched a batman film before in fact i have never watched a super hero film before id picked up that this was the best of them so when i saw that it is available on amazon prime instant video i thought id have a look well i have discovered that super hero films are certainly not for me as a child i really loved the batman dc comics and in that animated world for children it works very well however the realisation of the comic character in a more adult context is just totally silly that voice he has sounds like dirty harry only more so and it is just funny the joker seems to be able to construct remarkable situations at a moments notice it is not credible at every turn there seems to be something that has no credibility with the viewer and so you just dont care about what is happening there is no adventure in this film nor are there any particularly clever twists or turns in the plot primarily there seem to be some situations that the joker sets up batmans solutions seem to be boring brute force either with fists or technology in fact i think the dc comic batman was a cleverer and more interesting guy it was quite nice seeing michael caine but i dont think his or anyone elses script was very imaginative boring and silly throughoutthis movie is so damn boring one of if not the worst film ever made give me a real movie with real actors with a producer with real talent these movies made me want to throw up they were so horrible dont waste your 3 hours watching this movie its not worth it theres better ways to spend your time did anyone really believe that green thing that cant even talk it was like that stupid jar jar character they put on star wars now if you want to see a movie with action and adventure with better writing then go watch face off dont waste a minute of your time on this movie please who ever voted and made this movie #3 where it doesnt belong it should be along the lines of worst movie ever i rather watch from justin to kelly a billion times then waste my time watching a movie like this im not sure why people think its so great a lot of people talk about this being heath ledgers last movie people not only was he working on another movie that movie had decided to use his footage so when it comes out that will be his last movie do people think it is dark because it is mistakenly believed heath died because of this movie even though it has already been proved to not be true cause ive seen cartoons that are darker theme wise last night i saw an anime on scifi that was more twisted than this movie this movie really wasnt as dark and twisted as they made it out to be and considering most of the violence is suggested rather than seen people cant say this is the most violent movie out there also why did the guy who played batman feel he had to talk as if he had laryngitis or bronchitis or something every time he talked when he was in batman costume people started giggling another problem was that it went on forever it went on and on and on and on i walked out im not sure how much longer there was to the movie but once the joker was caught by batman and you thought it was coming to an end in comes two face with commissioner gordons kidnapped family i had had enough by then the plus sides i like michael caine glad to see him in the movie i have always had a crush on gary oldman the makeup they did on harvey dent aaron eckhart after he became 2 face was brilliant and i liked what they did with the joker to a point but for what it was heath did a good job however i have to give this movie an over all d it was too long too boring too long too hyped and give batman a cough drop for petes sake  wow words cannot even describe how incredibly awful this movie was the acting was poor mediocre at best yes that is including heath ledgers supposedly oscar worthy performance as the joker the plot was simply terrible and amazingly uneven as if no one had bothered to make a final edit it is one of the slowest and most boring movies i have ever seen i have never walked out of a movie before but i was highly tempted with this mess checking my watch every few minutes before the one hour mark in what ended up being a two and a half hour movie that seemed oh so much longer i found that the best part of the film was when the credits started rolling whilst michael bays blockbuster movies are terrible at least they are somewhat entertaining sadly i cannot say the same for the dark knight ignore all the hype and dont be fooled by the trailers which suggest this may be a good film this movie was plain terrible a complete train wreck 1 10  i was so looking forward to this movie because i had heard such great things about it disappointed would be a huge understatement what the hell was this movie about as far as i could tell there was no story zero nothing literally nothing happened there was no plot no believable characters not even a single interesting scene or line of dialog to bump this film up to a 2 in my opinion just a total and absolute waste of time making and watching this movie i know movies are subjective but i just do not get how anyone can find this film remotely entertaining in any way there are several films in the top 250 i have seen and agree they should be there this belongs in the bottom 3 along with fargo and american beauty  sorry you qt worshippers this film first of all was no reservoir dogs and second of all doesnt have the edge or guts of fight club or american history x for example this is a tour de forced  im so full of my self pant load of a movie calculated hit for the im so full of my self yuppie money punk crowd who think they are hip and cool because they connect with the street analogy pulp fiction is to reservoir dogs as oceans 11 is to the getaway this film is a tarantino ego trip that merits no higher in my humble though strong opinion no higher than a 5 i can not believe that this movie received all the awards that it did it was long slow moving predictable and the acting was terrible i cant believe that they cut out over an hours worth of video to get it down to this length i wish that gandalf would have just given frodo a giant eagle in the first movie so that he could just fly in and drop the ring in the volcano and save us the pain of watching this series i was also worried that there was going to be a love fest between frodo sam and the other hobbits also with all of the computer generated scenes why go all the way to new zealand to film it at least it is all over with nowdespite hearing about what a classic this is i hadnt seen this until now all i can say is wow i didnt know how lucky i was before to miss this but now it is too late and i will never get those 3 hrs of my life back the acting is cheesy and the story is so simple and shallow those who thinks there is a deeper meaning must be thinking too hard i suppose a recent comparable movie would be 2012 but at least that had some ridiculous special effects all this had was some really bad acting the best parts were a couple of lol moments during the shooting scenes otherwise this has got to be one of the most boring movies ever and i fell asleep at least 5 timesdont get me wrong i generally like gory mature movies but this movie was terrible repulsive fast paste griddy storyline with no plot is not my idea of a good movie it was simply a bunch of unpleasant scenes put together sporadically in a timeline sequence until the end of the movie came and you come to realize the moral doing bad things isnt good for you also the most elementary concept one knows the only one that makes it out unscathed is samuel l jacksons part and i believe this is wholly because he abandoned the path of immorality teaching us what is commonly known through a disgusting and unorganized movie nothing at all embracive enthusing funny witty or intelligible i mean their were themes but they were incredibly dull and boarish i am blind to how people see this as a good movie i found this movie as a waste of lifeone of the worst movies i ever seen i didnt see it when it came out i saw it on my 50 inch flat screen hooked up to my stereo all my friends were telling me how good this movie was so i expected a lot heath leger was good cause everybody else was so bad this was one of the most boring batman ever he spoke in that deep voice with no personally all the scenes were dark it would have been nice if a little bit more of the movie was bright my main problem watching this was the sound when they spoke i had to turn to volume way up then when the special effects took place i had to lower it then i had to turn it up again when they spokethe best film thats ever been made thats a lie by my book this film is yes i think ill go as far as to say this bad in many ways where do i start 1 poor acting brando was the only saving grace in this film and the only reason i saw it through to the end the rest of the cast were not good i wanted to tear my eyes out and cut my ears off every time james caan came on screen for instance al pacino was awful too no chemistry in my opinion 2 boring seriously i was on the verge of turning this movie off there were no engaging elements to the film or story 3 it was very cheesy there are no words to describe this aspect justcheese all over 4 an incredibly annoying score ive read comments calling the score a classic i dont find a score that consists of bringing in the same high pitched melody in over and over again classic all in all what are the people of the world thinking ranking this movie so high 1 10 purely because of brando scorsese does it a million times better in my opinion a good movie is one that makes you feel diffrent when you leave the theater or puts a feeling on you that you havent experienced you have a true feeling that you got just by watching somthing i also ask what makes and entertaining movie to me its one that you just cant get enough of you can watch over and over again and it never gets old everyone raves about the godfather and its achievements i say its all a matter of opinion the performances are probably what makes this film a work of art itd be nearly impossible to find another film where diane keaton al pacino marlon brando james caan and the rest of the cast do work of such quality even in the sequel they begin to slack off with the exception of keaton and pacino what this movie also benefits from is the power of the story but there are moments where the overall mood becomes oppressive and a bit too slow the film is a joy to behold with an evocative score sensational photography and many other great elements would i put it up there at the top of the heap there are other films that are more consistent whose elements work well as a solid unit and deliver more satisfactory results i cant believe this movie got so high ratings have you all lost your minds this is one of the dumbest movies i have ever seen and im not talking batmans kicks being more than match for bullets this is a comic based movie suspension of disbelief is due with regard to things like that or cops cooperating with batman cops dont like sharing any power and neither does the govt apparatus which would rather have joker murder a hundred of civilians than let one vigilante like batman go free where suspension of disbelief is not due are the movies messages that it dumps in truckloads on viewers heads aw the poor corrupted cop who did this because of her mothers hospital bills aw hear ye the socialized medicine is needed aw aw we do spying on people where necessary but its still wrong aw aw we never kill villains even when they wrong do us aw aw the prisoners are at heart good people we just should re socialize them more aw the scene that topped all the other in hypocrisy and idiocy was when one of the prisoners has thrown the detonator for the civilian boat through the window in real life hed be pushing the button in a second this is where the movie gets it all wrong or perhaps it lies to us but in such way that we should notice after all at the end of the movie we are lectured that some things are more important than the truth like having a hero with bad taste in women speaking of which you dont really believe that brucey and harvey would swoon all over the mediocre looking rachel in real real world the two would rather be jointly gang banging the russian ballerina which was a stunner than trying to get rachels affection who in turn had a misfortune of a scriptwriter getting her spout the mandatory post feminist line oh bruce dont make me any chance blah blah but lets put this aside and come back to make believe real world strangely in this movie the only character with an ounce of sanity was joker he just did not let that sanity get in his way have you noticed this he was the only character that the scriptwriters let tell the truth how things were in his view everyone else was a puppet with mind tied up by shallow politically correct slogans so even here the movie got it wrong the joker was sane just evil all in all this was not the epic battle between good and evil but between dumb and evil perhaps that is why this movie was after all so boring the characters are shadows of their former selves from previous batman movies this is a version disinfected from everything that has mental life like in one south park episode where the directors digitally replaced all the guns with walkie talkies in their movies this movie has had that kind of surgery applied to it at the scriptwriting stage the result is a neutered cat instead of a tiger tragedies portrayed in it are fake we feel that characters portrayed in it do not feel what they exhibit but exhibit what they feel they should have been exhibiting because they feel watched all the time one of reasons the movie is not believable is precisely because good guys do not pull the trigger the good guys are pc pussies with lawsuits worrying them more than bullets the dumb ideology and yes politicized world view emerges even in selection of the main hero a lawyer lawyer as a hero puhlease everyone is a walkie talkie for some false line you get the idea this is a movie staffed with mannequins instead of characters i had a gnawing suspicion somewhere at the back of the head when i was watching the movie that all of it was result of cold calculation that it was all just designed to pull emotional strings of naivetÜ©s with whatever calls once to never kill a villain then to tax funded health care is good thing then whatnot this movie does not believe in itself why should i believe in it then and dont tell me its just a movie yes its just a movie just an exceptionally dumb one why the dark knight sucks it is basically akin to triumph of the will pure propaganda batman = george w bush or any shady uber rich government official as bruce wayne he must portray himself as a spoiled bumbling fool who boozes and womanizes and is just a big walking joke as batman he can use any kind of destructive method to take down the bad guy in this case the joker is often called a terrorist including using billions of dollars of wayne enterprises money to secretly implant 3d sonar imaging devices into a wave of new cell phones that flood the market and consequently give him the ability to create a 3d map of the city that can locate and track anyone his closest friends who know his secret identity think this tracking map is unethical but he justifies it by saying that he must use any means necessary to take this one down does any of this sound familiar besides all of this the movie feels like that 15 minute montage of super heroic feats from every first superhero movie sssssssssttttttttttrrrrrrrreeeeeeettttttccccchhhhhheeeeedddddd ooooouuuuuutttttt to 2 1 2 hours it starts out too talky with a bunch of mob bosses among them eric roberts wriggling out from under da harvey dent aaron eckhart in court and throws a few unnecessary story lines up in the air that dont get resolved until much later and poorly at that then strings together action set pieces that all seem like leftovers from a die hard movie for the next 2 hours then finally wraps it up with characteristically cheesy the fight will continue dialogue that every superhero movie ends with so its boring plus its poorly done apart from that save your money  i am not a comic book reading loser or a fanatic of the batman films however i did think batman begins was somewhat entertaining so stupidly i believed that since this film had made so much money in so few days there had to be something to it well there wasnt this is a boring slow cheaply made movie the entire budget seems to have gone into making the batmobile motorcycle some explosions and not much else the city of gotham is clearly chicago there wasnt even an attempt to make it look any different one can actually see the word chicago on one of the buildings during a scene as for the acting batmans costume looked cool and no acting was really required by him the joker character was ok but his voice was really gay and whats with the guy with the eye liner i think he was supposed to be the mayor was he gay too he should have gotten together with the joker the worst of the group was the ugly woman who played rachel the slut that led batman on while dating that irritating harvey dent she was so hideous i had a hard time looking at the screen seriously is there a shortage of actresses in hollywood what fool cast this creature this movie is about three hours long it seemed like ten and for most of the time nothing happens people were suckered into this crap by the hype and the marketing one could sense the disappointment in the crowd when it was over ive never seen so many looking at their cell phones during a movie people paid to be entertained and got a long slow stupid boring mean spirited disgusting ass numbing piece of crap the dark night sucks ridiculously overrated monumentally disappointing whoa imdb wont let me post this its too short obviously well then let me tell you this i never cared for the re franchising of batman its just more of the hollywood style money making and the more money they put into a film and its promotion the more hype they create but it sadly isnt just about them wanting us all to go see the movie no they get really greedy and after a certain point is reached they proclaim this same movie is a piece of art its that simple and if you can succeed in believing it is it makes your life easier and jollier you go to imdbcom you give it a 10 you read some exuberantly positive comments and smile contentedly you read some unfavourable ones and mutter to yourself that there are always idiots who just dont get it and youre happy cause millions of people are desperately trying to prove to each other that they are part of something bigger than life and are succeeding in that endeavour and you are one of them not me guys not me i like a lot of stupid films but not this one it makes me sick for it reminds me how gullible we all are and just how much we want to dream but we only want the dreams to come on the big screen this is one of the many possible ways kindly provided by our great benefactors we can spend our ugly dollars on something shiny and new and inspiring and harmless and easy to digest so be happy eat your popcorn feel nice eat well after the movie sleep tight dream beautifully but dont bother trying to wake up cause we are all in a really comfortable place and waking up will be very painful on the other hand the dream factory could keep you contented by offering you another piece of art for 10$ or thereabouts kudos to our benefactors and encorethis is the biggest ridicule after george w not being able to spell the word nuclear right it is simply beyond my understanding how hundreds of thousands of people could have rated this film even worthy of attention batman the dark knight is a piece of cake with capital letters ok a huge fat turkey of a movie is not a new kid on the block but no piece of trash has ever been so over rated as this one is i know that heath ledgers death came unexpected and the guy was a solid actor but you cannot praise something to the skies out of commiseration and loyalty cause however hard i am trying i am not able to find any other substantial reason why you would give christopher nolans new embarrassment of an action flick six seven eight or nine points let alone ten this movie is lacking a consequent plot a cohesion of the myriad of action scenes it has been broken down into and a common sense to know when enough is enough besides i really dont know which film those who said the acting was brilliant had watched but what i see is that christian bale maggie gyllenhal and gary oldman all lack conviction and had the end of the day and probably the collection of money in mind when they stood in position in front of the blue screen oh and quite often i really got confused from time to time i needed to be reminded i was not watching the new james bond movie or terminator cxxxviii the gadget scene the plane escape scene are truly pathetic as is the concept of reintroducing the character of two face the guy who did not read the instructions manual of the microwave oven since we are talking about a comic book adaptation i dont bother to mention how unrealistic action sequences are try wiring a town hospital with all that security and cctv cameras they got installed or try buying unnoticed the oil reserves of a medium sized country to blow half of the city into the sky but let me ask why nobody out of the immense crew that put this film together could pay attention to small details like when police forces storm the hong kong building to catch the bat suit guy arigato arigato they wave each other up the stairs does this mean china needs to hire law enforcement personnel from japan ok i am stopping there i know i might already have made some enemies among comic book and action film lovers this forgettable encounter with batman however reminds me again i am not one of them this is not really a review of the movie you can find plenty of those this is just my rant about the reviews of the movie as of the time of this writing the dark knight is ranked as the number 1 movie of all times on imdb are you freaking kidding me really better than the godfather better than pulp fiction raiders of the lost ark the usual suspects if you think this is true than you are one of the following a a moron b have not grown any pubic hair yet c are employed by the production company in order to create false hype about an overall average movie and to exploit the tragic death of a brilliant young actor whose performance in this particular film was only average for the purposes of making a profit vote 1 out of 10 this rating system is bull  i rated this movie 1 10 cause its rated 89 10 the film was boringruined 2 hours and lead to my 1st imdb comment the whole story revolves on 3 incident and they go like joker strikes batman saves again joker strikes batman saves and judging by the fact that it was rated 85 when i watched this movie i was expecting kick ass t2 and all i got was a 2 facemy fav in the anime series who is portrayed by a dumb ass who lacks any kind of style whatsoever and looks like sh1t even before he burned his face a reasonable rating for this film would be a 75 10look for the movies it beat in top 100 list and surely doesnt belong there and when youve watched ityoull come back writing one comment of your own peace i feel like im in the twilight zone is this what passes for movies now since you are reading comments stroll by the voter demographics highest ratings are in the youngest age group thats not to say all young people are voting 10 10 thank goodness some are smart enough to have seen older movies and cant believe the insane over hype but too many just werent around for the good stuff before overuse of cgi or back when there was actually a plot the characters were developed or there were plausible reasons for things do people honestly think this is perfect will it be remembered as a classic 10 20 30 40 years from now no the more i think about it the more irritating it becomes in the grand scheme of things who the hell cares what movies it beats out because those classics did survive decades upon decades and this is just temporary infatuation what gets on my nerves is that movies were doing so well for so long people cared about making quality entertainment for the most part its hard to put my finger on it because i kept dozing off during the movie but the dark knight is really flawed and to think that with this undo attention that this will set the new trend trend for how movies are made is agonizing to anyone that lives for movies thanks a lot nolan i think now ill take up drinking as a hobbyit is inconceivable that this movie is anywhere near the top 250 it is 25 hours of a coarse voice explosions cheap one liners and terrible plot batman begins i thought was brilliant it had genuine pathos its characters were very believable and had depth to them the acting was phenomenal but this piece of crap is completely the opposite i have seen spaghetti westerns and childrens cartoons with better acting then the dark knight with the exception of the joker by ledger who was decent there is no screenplay there are explosions i think michael bay actually produced and directed this there is a random side plot to hong kong that had no purpose or place in the story the cell phone tracking technology is the dumbest and most far fetched thing i have ever seen in a film the only reason this movie gets any recognition or praise is because of ledgers death that plus the batman and joker fanboys that flood imdb to give this crap a 10 they like how cool joker was and sided with him and they feel bad for ledger a + b = in top 10 of imdb this movie is completely forgettable and deserves no awards and none of your time it does deserve to be an example of a horrendously written poorly shot poorly lit pathetic excuse of a moviea nihilistic style piece where all the exceptional creative and artistic talents are wasted in enhancing humanities most negative emotions the movie may be well made but as a piece of fiction it fails to justify its existence it identifies and taps humanities core emotions but does not understand how they operate and thus cannot raise their level scaring people is easy but understanding the purpose of fear and how it transforms into courage and clarity is to understand the true nature of heroism and what really inspires humans this film lacks any understanding of how good people have actually been able to defeat tyranny by turning the fear around there is an exceptional opportunity for creating genuine hope from the storys premise but it is lost in part because i dont believe the director knows how to find it finally the actor playing the joker appeared to show at least two of the strongest indicators of a vulnerability to develop mental illness it may not have been wise to have such an individual play this kind of character i honestly would not recommend this movie to anyonesimply the worst i was hoping for some good moviehell i fought itll be great my brother saw it first and said it was good sh it than it was my turn i remember when i was already going out from cinema ive wished i could punch twice nolan in his face batman is my fave comic herobut its not important right now whats important is that god damn nolan gave us piece of max commercial movie for little kids its not realistic as nolan said it would be and its not dark either i shouldve known that the dark knight will be the same sh it as bat beginsbut it doesnt help for my frustration i wish burton could make few more bat movieshis dark vision of gotham was incredible art deco with style and fashion of 50s combine with present timeok with late 80sand jack as the jokeri think it was a role of his lifeh ledger was good but he didnt beat jack the king but he was really goodshame that ledger was the only one who knew what he was doingand in the endjoker didnt save the dayand the dark guano is one of the worst movies ive ever seen 1 of 10 is more than it deserves im not from the great us of aor england so if my comment seems a little shi tty give me a brake post scriptum bale was totally without balls in this movie i like him butäó_but im telling what ive seen but what totally destroyed the movie were giant holes in plot and this incredible stupid device that converts mobile phone in allah god buddha confucius knows what ps2 i must tell thisäó_do any of you believes that prisoners on one of those boats loaded with explosives wouldnt have blown to high sky that other boat and the same about those good citizensäó_one of the worst films i have ever seen i nearly fell asleep during the movie due to lack of a compelling story a big budget film at its worst that was hyped beyond measure due to the appearance of a certain actor yes some of the special affects and costumes are excellent like they are in all batman movies the car was embarrassingly poor however and christian bales acting was non existent whos voice was simply peculiar hands down worst batman to date well done hollywood hype machine for scoring another hit with a useless film i have great respect with how much money they have made with so so so little how this film has won oscars is a myth and probably just a sympathy vote including the high rating on this website avoid like the plague boring unexciting tedious overlong and uninterestingonly a few choice words i can think of off hand to describe this total and utter let down of a film that everyone else seems to be raving about what a load of absolute rubbish it was a total waste of time from start to finish i had originally decided not to see this film having not overly enjoyed batman begins but gave in in the end due to all the hype and the fact that it had soared to the no 1 spot in the imdb database i was absolutely shocked and amazed by this how it can go ahead of such brilliant films as shawshank redemption and star wars ill never know not to mention the masterpiece of lord of the rings i see tdk is currently in the no 3 position all i can say is that i only hope it continues to drop places to put things in perspective i wish i hadnt of bothered with tdkwithin ten minutes i was sitting there in the cinema yawning my head off for one thing i had difficulty understanding many of the sentences the characters were saying and for another the whole film just didnt hold my attention i thought christian bale was boring and wooden in his role of batman with that silly voice when hes in the suit to match morgan freeman and michael caine were fine as always but utterly underused if their is one shred of goodness in this film through my eyes it would be for heath ledger as the joker his untimely death shortly after the making of this film did ill admit help spur me on to see tdk and after all the hype put out for his performance he certainly didnt disappoint he truly stole every scene he was in and so deserves every credit he gets he was a great young actor who will be sadly missed i just cant believe how so many people love this film so much what is the matter with all of you no disrespect to any other imdb reader writer of course everyone is entitled to their opinion but mine is one star for this film and one star only tdk was the worst film of the summer for me wall e was better by far at least that film had bags of imagination character development and story this had nothing even the action sequences were uninteresting and flat it was so overlong too that after a while i was silently shouting at the screen  come on get on with it i will never see another batman film again in the cinema i dont care what level the hype meter goes to i knew this would be crap and it was by the way in case your wondering my one star rating is for heath ledgers performance and for it alone i must be the odd one out i saw this movie with my son both of us found the movie very bad bad story line very bad action only reasonable acting was heath ledger as the joker yes there is action lots of action but the action is action for the action it hard to see a story line the story is also very over the top i know it is a kind of sf movie but unlike starwars the action and gadgets are totally exaggerated i liked the other batman movies better so overall a wast of money it was hard not to fall asleep i decided to watch this trilogy with a completely open mind to see what the fuss was all about i was rather embarrassed by the fact that i had never seen any of these movies which were heralded as great cinematic classics instead of the masterpiece i was promised however i was left with a great mediocrity the characters were barely 2 dimensional the plot was riddled with holes and horribly rushed and the dialogue was cheesy episode v was perhaps the least painful to watch but still isnt close to being good i dont know if its a case of a movie aging very badly but i cant for the life of me understand the allure of it to each their own i guess moves even further from the source material more so than the two towers by peter jackson and fran walsh too many elements are changed from the heart of tolkiens work sam would never have been turned away and by the way just how did he find that sword and the light of elendil in shelobs lair with no light source also shelob is spider like but not a spider there were no webs in her lair even worse is the acting of john noble as denethor yes denethor has despaired but int he movie his madness is related to his use of a palantir and competing against sauron saurons will was stronger and he bent denethor left him bereft of hope this movie he is a caricature a cheap poorly rendered badly overacted caricature faramirs character was assassinated in the second movie but it is his father who is torn asunder even worse in this one aragorn had the sword anduril after he left elrond and rivendell and says so in the the two towers before entering the hall to meet with wormtongue and theodenbook here it is given to him by elrond who never came to visit aragorn it was elronds sons and the remaining rangerswho allude to no longer protecting the borders of the shire foreshadowing the scouring and they brought the banner of the king not the sword aragorn acts like a haughty king in the paths of the dead where in the book the scenario is much more dramatic and better also the dead were released before the battle at pellenor fields after helping them capture the ships with black sails that scene looked like the frighteners part 2 absolutely ridiculous it is a pretty to look at movie with no substance when compared to the source material tolkien loved the scouring of the shire and felt it was the true climax of the entire work yet peter jackson called it a simple denouement and said he hated it the better story isnt in these movies and i hope that people can read with a finer eye than they watch these movies with they arent that good and each slips further down the first adaptation was the best of the three and this was the worst hands down first i am a huge fan of the lotr series by tolkien it is one of the most richly detailed and wonderfully written stories of all time and it pains me to see the dreck that peter jackson has produced i didnt mind the fellowship of the ring i thought it was definitely the most concise and well directed of the three films also the visual aesthetics of the films are excellent the set design and choice of locale is impeccable and i applaud the people involved for their dedication to recreating the surreal wonderful world of tolkien on screen however it is the technical aspect of the project what should be the real beef of the film that puts the knife in the two towers marked the real beginning of jacksons self righteous altering of tolkiens noble story and left many fans and serious film goers wondering what went wrong but return of the king takes the cake for what could very possibly be the worst adaptation of a novel in film history jackson changes large portions of the plot of the novel for no apparent purpose even friends of mine who had not read the book asked me why certain scenes resolved the way they did the character development is excruciating as some of the major character based events from the book seem rushed and inconsequential in the context of the film jackson has done a great job at remembering the characters names and their titles but has drawn a blank on their behavior values emotions and relationships with other characters the script is pathetic tolkiens majestic storytelling and tasteful use of pathos and emotional turmoil is replaced by long winded sappy clichÜ© monologues complete with the exact same musical score used for the previous two films entire scenes are based around petty arguments and melodramatic emotional breakdowns and filler dialog is rampant it seems that jackson did this simply to keep the 3 hour running time the action sequences are grandiose and somewhat true in objective form to tolkiens telling of them but jackson employs cinematography that is on par with a nickelodeon miniseries using cheap close ups and nauseatingly swirling camera angles that leave the viewer feeling more confused than involved in the action jackson throws in some cheap action film comic relief during the battles giving the viewer the impression that the characters are not fighting for their lives but rather swashbuckling for swashbucklings sake very simply this is not the lord of the rings that i grew to love years ago when i read tolkiens masterpiece i am a supporter of artistic freedom in the adaptation process ie kubrick coppola but not when the adapter simply has no artistic ability in his craft jackson genius behind such film classics as the frighteners and dead alive this film does not belong in the top 250 nor do the other lotr films knowing that this film is above seven samurai and casablanca and that the first two lotr films are the reason citizen kane sits at #11 sickens methe difference between art that comes out of the studio system and art that comes out of a lifetime if only we could develop a moving image pillar that was not driven by base profit we might see an expression of tolkien on film that was decent the fall this is the beginning of the end for our civilization when art is so corrupted that people can no longer even tell the difference our way of life is over anthropologist alien or otherwise will mark the success of these films and of george bush and of television as the harried and quickened end of the west not unlike the fall of numenornot that you would know anything about that from these adaptations what a disgrace how dare jackson call this tolkien  i think that there is a herd mentality about this film because tarantino cultists liked it people say things like the best film of the 90s people seem to think that they are not cool unless they loved pulp fiction maybe i just dont get it but what is so great about it its circular big deal the entire film is pointless and i really dont care about any of the characters the violence is gratuitous i am not squeamish i have watched and i have to admit enjoyed romeros dead films it is supposedly funny when the kid gets shot in head and his brain is splattered all over the inside of the car yep that is hilarious the only good thing about the film is that john travolta is in it i have seen many movies in my time a lot of bad movies and a lot of good movies i like movies from all genres this is easily one of the worst movies i have ever seen i cannot comprehend why this movie is considered good an overacted badly directed self important repetitive uninspired shallow video game of a movie not a single character of depth ok smigle slighty what was the point no imagination in the directing acting set and art design slow motion oy am i sick of slow motion now that was creative editing whats with the ending that was a 30 minute goodbye get on the boat already die already die die die die die how long does it take to die gandalf all powerful wizard nine hours of movie and all he can do is shine a light in the dragons eyes ooooh scary light not recommended for anyone and those who liked it are wrongwronghowever the real acting triumph of the film is elijah wood as frodo baggins he continues his descent into corruption with an incredible talent that many could not pull off woods performance is so critical to the film because it determines the rings power to corrupt which needless to say is absolute the first two films established jackson as an incredible visionary shooting vast landscapes from his native new zealand with return of the king jackson really gets a chance to show off with hands down the most beautiful visuals of the trilogy jackson makes return of the king a gorgeous feast for the eyes while never resorting to mcg level over the topless jackson stays very grounded in his characters not letting the effects tell the story but only assist the wonderful dialog and characters think of return as a mix of fellowship and two towers with enough action and character development worthy of ending a film event of this magnitude the bottom line fans of the films will not be disappointed hardcore tolkien lovers might be upset by plot changes and interpretations made by jackson and the other writers however it is unrealistic to expect a completely true adaptation of the novels being that film is an entirely different medium despite the alterations jackson consistently stays true to the major themes and ideas from the original text while adding some of the finest film making ever put to screen the lord of the rings the return of the king is one of the most finely tuned and cinematically perfect films ever made not only the best of the trilogy but a crowning achievement in epic film makingi personally believe that although the godfather got rave reviews and is generally thought of as the best movie of all time i didnt care for it the truth of the matter is that the epic saga insists upon itself it was predictable it was depressing without anything really to be depressed about and lastly the dancing elves were really quite over the top and unnecessary it was arrogant pompous and there was really no plot it was the worst movie i ever saw it should have taken a lesson from the movie teenage mutant ninja turtles which was by the way the best movie of all time it was atrocious also what was the deal with the birthday party scene in which al pachino gets plastered on moonshine with barbara bush or maybe it was paula dean i cant remember which one i get the two confused to even compare this to movies such as the pink panther and the wiz is atrocious both of those movies were brilliant compared to this high budget slouch even marlin brandos benign performance is not enough to bring this movie up to a two star ratinglet me just start by saying that i am 50% italian i have nothing against mafia movies in fact i have nothing against any type of movie but to say that this is the best movie of all time is simply insane i saw absolutely nothing special i kind of enjoyed the performances of al pacino marlon brando and james caan but besides that there is not one really exceptional feature in sight and the fact that it is one hour too long only brought down my enjoyment its not the worst film of all time but not the best either i must be one of the few individuals on this planet that totally detested this film i left the cinema feeling extremely ill i went along to this film on the recommendation that it was highly amusing but i guess their idea of humour isnt quite the same as mine sure it had some clever moments but why belabour the point this movie is a painsimply horrible boring too long bad acting bad writingpratically i don t save nothing of this pile of garbagethe fake looking special effects are some of the worst i have ever seenthe sad thing is that this overrated turkey won so many oscar quite a testament of the low level of the academy awardsterriblethe editing is a complete mess the only saving grace are the wonderful new zealnd landscapeshow many ending it had 10 20 come on its simply laughablein conclusion a very bad and overrated movieanother thing this movie is number 3 of all the time imdb webmaster its time to change the imdb vote modalitiesthis is quite possibly the worst movie ever made not funny just stupid worse than bill and teds bogus journey worse than anything ever except maybe natural born killers they both were horrid i can not believe that anyone could enjoy this movie i guess if i were on crack it might be mildly funny but i doubt it i was expecting much more for the acting considering that there are some good actors in it they must have decided to see how bad they could make something and still get people to watch it there is no other logical explanation for why they would be a part of such a stupid movie i read the godfather novel it was one of the best books that i have ever read not one minute in the story was i not entertained or interested i was very excited to see how frances ford coppolas collaboration with mario puzo the author of the book would translate this into a movie when watching the movie i tried to put all of my memory of the book into the back of my head and try to enjoy the movie but sadly the movie was just not entertaining as a movie by itself yes the cast is one of the best ever assembled marlon brando al pacino robert duval etc but all of the main events that should be entertaining like the elimination of all the bosses in the end or the murder of sunny corleone at the toll both but sadly they just bore you to the point were you want even marlon brando to die which he later does even the performances from the actors themselves especially marlon brando leave much to be desired from these awesome actors this is without a doubt the most overrated movie of all time if you want to see the life of a mobster done right see scorceses casino and goddfellas these do not only show the life of a mobster but they are also entertaining with awesome acting from robert de niro and joe pesci every time i give this movie 2 10 thats because mario puzo was involved  overrated is an understatement this movie is start to finish garbage i though reservoir dogs was an ok movie and i liked inglourious basterds a lot i dont have a problem with violent or perverse content in movies my all time favorite is david finchers fight club but this movie is just crap i understand the nostalgic aura about how this movie revolutionized what was acceptable to do in movies but that doesnt make it a good movie by any means the acting as a whole was entirely sub par as usual samuel l jacksons acting is consistent with the career he has built on shouting a la snakes on a plane and contributed nothing positive to the movie same goes for john travolta whose acting was arguably worse than jacksons theres a significant unconvincing memorization tone to his lines the only reason this is considered to have resurrected his career is because he was in the movie at all once the movie became a cult classic he became the marketable actor he once was i already said i dont have a problem with movies that contain explicit language but in pulp fiction there are certain instances where too many expletives are inserted and im not sure for what effect if you listen to tarentinos lines as jimmy and jacksons lines when theyre cleaning out the car i think these lines best exemplify the overkill im talking about another thing about the movie is it is generally not relatable i realize this seems like not a legitimate complaint after all how marketable would a movie really be if it was wholly relatable however i just felt like the over glorification heroin use among other aspects really turned me off also usually movies that glorify or portray behavior lifestyles similar to those depicted in pulp fiction have characters that are normal human beings in this movie every character is either a murderer a gangster a drug dealer someone with a drug problem an accomplice to a crime or a rapist i just dont see the redeeming social value here if you like movies with quality acting character development any sort of plot or a message that doesnt bash the bible chances are pulp fiction is not for you the one thing that tarentino got right was the title pulp fiction this movie is both cheaply produced art and fake its an okay film epic and all of course the fact that its an epic like gladiator or troy doesnt mean its good troy proved that fact and alexander continued to prove it with one star antics to be quite frank peter jackson is an overrated director much like the lord of the rings movies are overrated movies if you notice all three are located in the top fifteen films this one happens to be ranked higher than greatly superiour films such as seven samurai schindlers list and even casablanca this is not the case with camera angles that make you sick utilising the admittedly beautiful landscape of new zealand to help push across into our heads the true epic feeling of middle earth but wait where are the interesting characters every one of them you feel so bored with by the time the first film is up you seem to hope that theyd be dead by the second one but no they come along to the third one to kick some sauron ass heres my view of lord of the rings a whole load of walking lord of the rings fellowship of the ring points there walks lord of the rings the two towers points there walks trips up walks on lord of the rings return of the king points there walks throws ring into mountain walks away take those completely identical scenarios and pile them up with useless plot for three to four hours per movie depending on which one you watch and i myself wouldnt touch the extended versions you really get the idea that the academy awards truly are flawed why look forrest gump won best film of 1994 instead of the shawshank redemption or pulp fiction titanic won best film of 1997 instead of la confidential and why lookey here lotr rotk won best ing film of 2003 instead of mystic river perhaps next year well have the constant gardener as the best film of 2005 that may actually redeem the oscars failing reputation a reputation that had truly fallen when they took this half arsed effort of a movie and worshipped it as best film  really now i cant say that this is the worst movie of all time but it certainly isnt the greatest the mere fact that tbs plays this movie sixteen times per week thereby forcing you to watch it over and over again does not mean that it is good i therefore call for a surge of negative reviews to be leveled against this mediocre film so that with the help of mark twain and his angels we will be able to oust it from its ill deserved spot as imdb #1 movie of all time honestly my fellow americans this film is the kind of thing that makes us look bad merry christmas and to all a good night
