zany witty funny stylish classic and masterful pulp fiction is my favourite film of all time its delivers its laughs through phenomenal performances from uma therman john trovolta quentin tarantino ving rhames bruce willis and samuel l jackson especially tarantino is one of the few film-making geniuses that hasnt graced the world with enough of his works his visual excellence and stylish storytelling techniques are on complete display in this film tarantino also gives us an ensemble of characters with flawed and yet unique personalities only tarantino characters have his characters are impressive and yet very flawed very human and yet each and every one of them manages to be ridiculously charismatic and witty the writing in this film is absolutely flawless providing one of the most quotable scripts in history pulp fiction is a masterpiece of contemporary cinema that manages to be both effective and enjoyableyoud certainly have to be over a certain age to watch this movie. not because it contains small amounts of very realistic and believable violence kids are used to that nowadays but very much so because of the psychological impact it could have. forget horror ... if i was a kid and had seen this movie it would completely alter my perception of humanity given i would understand it. once beyond that certain age this movie will impress you to say the least. shawshank redemption places a man in the wrong place at the wrong time early 1900s and in the worst kind of scenario. hes convicted of the murder of his wife and sentenced to life imprisonment. this is how the movie starts. from this point on the majority of the scenes will take place in the shawshank prison facility. logicly as a viewer you side for the andy dufresne beautifly interpreted by tim robbins. it doesnt really matter whether you think he did it or not ... hes stuck in there and it looks like hell be there for a while. friendships are born and enemies are made as you would expect. the way this movie maintains a thrilling storyline describing the friendships however is stunning. at the receiving end of one of those friendships is red redding morgen freeman a fellow inmate. red can get you anything and as andy red is serving a life sentence. lets just say they have the time to get to know each other learn from each other and eventually save each other. because of the limited scenery the story and acting performance gets all the attention it deserves. if i had to condense this movie into a few words intelligence justice friendship being human redemption would all sound like understatements. saying anything more about this masterpiece would spoil your viewing experience. its just one youll have to watch if you love movies.you only have to watch pulp fiction to get that qt truly understands the meaning of the word: cool qts movies are all about tough guys and centerfold hot chicks who talk about pop culture movies and music but its his sense of language and prose that define his style like raymond chandler or elmore leonard he knows what great dialog sounds like and boy do these characters get a lot of cool things to talk about qts characters are masters at exhibiting great one-liners but theyre also alive with unique quirks and eccentricities mia is hip to knowing the difference between an elvis-man and a beatles-man jules winnfield exhibits a crude rough persona but can recognize a miracle when he sees one butch is a boxer who is as much of a hero as a he is a killer in a movie where the characters are defined by their self-referential discussions and kinetic personalities they are in fact the pulp to the fiction however pulp fiction may also be best known for its splendidly memorable moments that have become a part of popular culture in of themselves think about the dance off in jack rabbit slims its not great dancing but the moment is fun and playful or consider the most quoted scene of the film where jules and vincent talk about big macs theres something visceral and even moving about the films style qt seems to be lamenting his own taste and ideals on worldly topics in fact you can determine what his very soul is driven by at the core of his dialog but its also a film that lends itself to the laymens quality of life where the characters do and say things that relate to what people actually do and talk about and also lets not forget the nature of qts film making no other director has been so eagerly and shamelessly referenced in other films since steven spielberg some of qts best contemporaries are guy ritchie matthew vaughn and james gunn  who are also known for their mesmerizing characters and self-referential dialog what they get is that qts films are snub-nosed and brilliant with great inventive energy and personal to what qt is all about like his predecessors who influenced him qt understands that skill and craftsmanship are only half the work and that a passion for sticking to your guns and making strong personal films makes up the bulk of all great hollywood legends if you want to know what great film making is all about just watch pulp fiction and marvel at its excellence you know what to expect. youve read all the reviews youve heard how good it is from your friends so you know what to expect. you already know that return of the king the third and final film in the amazing lord of the rings trilogy is an awesome and truly epic film experience. but for those who are still sceptical since lotr is such a nerdy enterprise im here to convince you to take a chance on this great film. first and foremost this movie is action-packed. yes the beginning is besides some murder and frightening scenes pretty peaceful. but when the armies of evil and the armies of men have fully gathered together at the awe-inspiring city of minas tirith thats when the fun begins. horses run over orks by the thousands giant mumakil elephants trample everybody and an army of ghosts show up and slaughter everything. to top it all off we have a showdown between warrior-princess eowyn and the undead leader of the nazgul the witch king and heck be darned if he isnt seriously scary enough to make hell freeze over with his voice alone. we also have legolas taking down an entire mumak singlehandedly. all this makes return truly entertaining to watch since the intensity and suspense has already been setup. but this film isnt only about slaughtering orcs: there are several different genres mashed up here. the freaky scenes where the giant spider shelob chases frodo through her lair bring to mind the creepier horror films from the 80s such as the thing. for any girls in the audience there is obviously the romance between aragorn and elven babe arwen and there is also eowyns feminist-style charge into the thick of battle. the point islotr was not made for creepy little nerds to obsess aboutyou know its really not the most entertaining movie ever made. you might look around the theater and see people yawning or even sleeping i guess its not avatar where you get cgi things or these 3d animation movie they make these days nor any batman or superman thing to thrill you with the action. what makes this motion picture special is that you will grow to love this movie  the first time you walk out of threatre you may not think of it as the greatest movie ever made  but theres something about it which makes you see it again and again and each time you see it you learn something new from it. you may be impressed by these great budget movie they make these days but you surely wont watch it a hundred times literally. count my words you will watch this movie that many times. its a story about hope as many people have already said in the review also about friendship and almost all these great human emotions. great great soundtrack by thomas newton is like a cherry on the cake. the movie is so realistic and so much real at places it actually makes you angry yet its not a depressing movie like schindlers list or a fairy tale one like forrest gump  its just a story which gives you hope and strength to face life and value it. believe me lol i have watched a lot of movies and this is the best one.you dont go and see a tarantino written film without expecting to see guns gore vulgarity and everything else associated with graphic violence it is his style and he is a master at it the fact is if you did not like the film and you knew he was involved you can only blame yourself this particular film was well written kudos to roger avary for helping tarantino the film is definitely oscar material that is why it received so many nominations in top spots best picture best actor best supporting actor best supporting actress and best director to name a few unfortunately i believe the violence prevented it from winning any of the major awards but tarantino and avary did get oscars for writing it their is talk about quarter pounders in france foot massages and what its like to kill a person if you can follow the film which basically runs backwards and if you are not offended by topics like violence rape and drug use you are probably a tarantino fan already finally who cares where tarantino got his inspiration from 80% of that film was exactly what you expect it to be and 20% of it is surprises for you his fans travolta jackson willis rames and thurman have my highest regards for a job well done i give the film a 10 out of 10 >you could look long and hard and never find a film more fun to watch than missionimpossible its classy stylish and heartpounding first let me address the frequent complaints about an overly complex plot this is not true there are a few lines you shouldnt miss but pay attention as you watch and you will be fine ie dont wander off to get popcorn ethan hunt is an american agent who has been framed and falsely accused of treason and the murder of his team he strikes out to clear his name with a group of similarly disavowed agents together they must prove that ethan was set up and prevent a dangerous weapons dealer from accessing a list that would betray the identities of every american deep cover agent alive the story is well constructed without the typical action movie plot holes the film is well balanced between action and dialog but the best part of mi is ethan hunt whom tom cruise not only portrays but lives and defines a rare action hero with a brain ethan is quick fit savvy with both a computer and a gun driven and determined he thinks quick on his feet and doesnt look back but the most rare and valuable trait he possesses is his powerful magnetism and charisma he makes you like him and instead of coming across as arrogant his confidence and assurance draw you to him i almost never give a film a 1010 rating but missionimpossible is one of those rare films that gets every detail right theres nothing to dislike and everything to enjoyhighly recommendedyou cant get more from a motion picture morgan freeman undoubtedly is a great actor and finding him as supporting actor in movies has been a culture in the modern cinema. the movie have a great plot the director did a great job concentration on the story have a solid field and the scope to keep you sticking to your chair the movie have such a dialogue delivery that you have to pause if you even blink your eye. shawshank redemption as the title is tempting so is the movie the star cast is great the performance cant get better and criticizing the all the rules and regulations of the society challenging the so many other other things the movie becomes a legend to the todays actors enough war movies enough jail breaks you have seen in movies but its all inspiring all contributing to the society and the diamond to the industry and the milestone for the coming actors is this. tim robbins performance is great as he lived the role and the eye stretcher movie shawshank redemption.  so it comes down to the hobbits frodo and sam to bear the burden of the ring and deal with the treachery of gollum. after a long journey they finally arrive in the dangerous lands of mordor seeking to destroy the one ring in the place it was created the volcanic fires of mount doom.notably it won all eleven academy awards for which it was nominated an oscar record and tied for largest number of awards won with ben-hur and titanic. instead of starting just where the previous film left off however it goes far back in time to the moment the tormented creature gollum first came to possess the one ring. in this flashback actor andy serkis who voiced gollum and performed his movements onset prior to the final cgi effects finally gets to appear on screen portraying gollums former self smÍ©agol. this disturbing scene serves as a potent reminder that the ring seeks to corrupt even the well-intentioned frodo who is increasingly struggling with the dark power of the ring himself. thus the film returns to the present following frodo sam and gollum as they journey ever closer to the foreboding land of mordor. they pass by the terrifying dark city of minas morgul watching as the dreadful army of the witch king sets out for the human strongholds in gondor and move on to the rocky stairs to cirith ungol where an even darker enemy lies in wait. meanwhile the rest of the fellowship reunites in rohan having defeated the wizard saruman on two different fronts at helms deep and isengard. they are not together for long though since the hobbit pippin gets into trouble making it necessary for him and gandalf to hastily depart for minas tirith capital of gondor. once there they find the steward of gondor denethor in an unstable mental state and the city preparing for battle against the amassing forces of sauron. denethor unwisely sends his only remaining son faramir back into bloody battle to prove himself. he returns nearly dead sending denethor over the edge of sanity.in another realm elf arwen begins her journey to immortal life in the grey havens on her way to leave middle-earth -- and aragorn -- forever but has a vision that causes her to once again reconsider her decision. back in rohan the men are preparing to ride to gondors aide. Í_owyn desperately wants to join the men in battle but her uncle king thÍ©oden orders her to stay and defend rohan if necessary. the hobbit merry also desires to ride with the men but is denied due to his small size and inexperience. aragorn is met there by the elf elrond who brings him the re-forged sword that was broken in the ancient battle with sauron and urges him to take a different route to gondor. heeding elronds advice aragorn along with elf legolas and dwarf gimli takes a cavernous path through the mountains where they meet ghoulish ghosts who betrayed aragorns ancestors and are doomed to eternal unrest unless they fulfill their broken oaths by aiding him. all but frodo sam and gollum will meet on the massive battlefield of the pelennor before the gates of minas tirith. the former three instead engage in a battle of wills between each other and the one ring as they head toward the fires of mount doom to destroy it. the thrilling conclusion to what has become the film event of our time - - the definitive screen fantasy -- features more spellbinding moments bigger battles more emotion and more poetry than the terrific first two films in the trilogy.it is visually stunning as it pops your eyes excites your senses and brings you in as close as a whisper for scenes of startling emotion.jackson boldly and faithfully brought j.r.r. tolkiens world to life as hes created the most epic and sweeping fantasy adventure of all time as evidenced in this third film.aside from thatthe movie is great at all levels including the brilliance of the cast.standing out amid an excellent cast is elijah wood stymied by tweeness in the earlier films but here convincingly developing the character of frodo as the embodiment of valor and self-sacrifice.aside from thatit provides the viewer a great tale of heroes bonded together by friendship and spectacular themes about very special friendship between hobbits elijah woods frodo and sean astins sam that touches us most of all.this is a masterpiece of filmmaking. yesterday i traveled 250 km to athens greece to watch the dark knight since i was in a town with no cinemas i was anxious after having watched batman begins and also curious to see for myself just how accurate the reviews that praised the film were and also just how good could heath ledgers acting really be. as a quick overall conclusion i must say that the dark knight is a masterpiece. dont get me wrong but calling a film a masterpiece doesnt make it flawless and doesnt automatically grant it a 10/10 mark. anyway in my opinion classifying a work of art as number 1263 or 134 of all time is a total waste of time. there cannot be any objective criteria in art and especially in films. there are so many genres so many different things a film can offer you and so many themes explored in the art of cinema that such a classification doesnt do any justice neither to the creators nor to the audience of a film. starting with the storyline. the dark knight can be watched without having watched batman begins. that is a very essential point. this is what makes a film whole and unique. those ready to watch a cartoon -like comic book superhero film should not even bother... this is christopher and jonathan nolans vision of a realistic 21st century metropolis controlled by organized crime actual mafia and every level of its infrastructure corrupt by it. everyone knows that you dont want to mess with such a regime because the consequences will be catastrophic and unpredictable as in a war. and people are obviously scared. therefore what is needed is someone to take this fear and through a symbol or an idea lash it out on the crime lords. this is batman. but this will inevitably lead to war. a war where anything is acceptable and the heroes morals and methods are always put to the test because as symbols their actions can be checked only by themselves. but batman is human and therefore flawed. who gives him the right to decide whats wrong or right therefore out of this war social instability grows and anarchy rises. that is what the joker represents no morals no apparent motives other than the destruction of the social network. in batman begins ras al ghoul wanted to create a new order of justice through chaos. joker goes one step further. he wants to establish chaos itself as the new order. the world is in a state of chaos anyway. crime rules and the only one willing to fix things and give people the justice they deserve is a man dressed up as a bat congratulations this is an idea worth watching on screen why stay true to the cartooned image of previous batmen when you can explore such a brilliant idea and the film is filled with several plot twists agonizing dilemmas and very meaningful dialogue. of course there are minor flaws plot-wise. sometimes the various events are a little confusing. the scarecrows cameo appearance is out of place. he should have a larger part in the film or not at all. the mutation of harvey dent into twoface near the end of the movie should have been explored more and at a slower pace. if there is one more film to complete a trilogy with twoface as the main villain i would be content. the directing by christopher nolan is fast-paced and tight. the movie stretches to 25 hours but in such a relentless pace that in the end all you want is more the only objection is that some action scenes near the end are a little too chaotic. you cant really make out whats happening. but others could object that thats the way batman works the villains cant really make out what exactly hit them in the end its all a matter of taste. ive left the acting for last because of the hype surrounding heath ledgers portrait of the joker. well the rumors are true: heath ledger is breathtaking. his joker is so believable and realistic that sometimes you think that the actor actually is a homicidal psychopath and not just acting the comparison to any other actor in this movie is completely out of place. heath ledger is in a league of his own. and that is extra credit to him considering that the rest of the cast did a fantastic job also. my personal favourites were aaron eckhart as harvey dent gary oldman as jim gordon and morgan freeman as lucius fox. michael caine should have more screen time though. least favourite was maggie gylenhaal. contrary to the general opinion i preferred katie holmes. but overall the performances were outstanding. christian bale is left for last: this is my favourite vision of batman. bale continues the work he did in batman begins. he creates a character complete in every way but in this film he somewhat lacks the emotional strength he had in batman begins. overall the dark knight is a complex crime drama of epic proportions filled with fast and banging action scenes ingenious storyline and brilliant acting by an all-star cast lead by a monumental performance by the late heath ledger. his joker is not only the best comic-book-villain-on-film but also one of the best villains in the history of the film industry. whether or not hell get an oscar is totally irrelevant. after all jack nicholson never won an oscar for his joker... who by the way should not be compared with ledgers joker because the logic behind each role is different. with christopher nolan behind the camera an actor as great as jack nicholson could have pulled off something similar or better. you can never know.yes stephen king writes drama. he also wrote stand by me the green mile and dolores claiborne. he has definitely been typed as a horror writer when he is an amazing tearjerker. this film is amazing. words cannot describe just how amazing this film truly is. i thought that i would not like this film as it looked like a bad sports movie. but when my science teacher told me i should see it because its a movie where you just go wow. i did and i was literally in tears by the end. not in tears of sadness but tears of joy. because the film was simply so beautiful. not very many films have made me cry. of course i cried at the endings of marley and me and toy story 3. but there are only 3 films ive ever cried at. some people say citizen kane or the godfather are the best movies ever. false. they are overrated. this film is a diamond in the rough. most people are stubborn and wont even take this gem into consideration. it truly is the best movie ever. the music the direction the cast. i wont give anything away you need to see the film to appreciate its true beauty but i will say that the music in this film puts john williams to shame and the movie reminds us that even in the most bleak of situations life can still be great. it is a great movie because it reminds us that hope is something that nothing can quench.yes it is definitely one of my top ten films i have made the point in the past that if an alien came down to earth and didnt know what a film was that this would be what we should show them it is a masterpiece in storytelling and general entertainment it is split into eight short chapters each with their own strengths but none which manage to disappoint you can jump in at any point during the film and be entertained as it does not focus very heavily on story but rather portrays the perfect mix of action adventure comedy crime drama and lots lots more it has a universal appeal and had me personally on the edge of my seat watching it due to its phenomenal tension and suspense i could watch it 100 more times and would not get bored ive said it before and ill say it again: this is the perfect filmyes i loved the dark knight. it is a moody tale about the struggle of good and evil and everything in between. i want to go on and discuss particular scenes that i found to be powerful but i really think you need to go into it as fresh as possible. surprisingly the trailers which seem to give too much away dont really come close to revealing what happens throughout. but what does happen is just as enticing as the brief glimpse during the preview. one complaint some may have is the length. it is around two and a half hours but frankly i didnt feel it. in fact a friend of mine who attended the screening with me looked at me after the end credits_„_ he wanted to watch it again right then and there. i guess with any movie you should try and not build it up too much because there is always someone who wont like a certain film no matter what it is. yet in the end heath ledgers joker aaron ecklands harvey dent and a phenomenal vision realized by christopher nolan makes tdk easily one of the years best.yes absolutely my nr 1 movie quotes tension a nice story and last of all the actors samuel l jackson john travolta harvey keitel & bruce willis those four actors make the movie like its a shot from an ordinary day off a gangsters life marvelousyeah must admit. this is my fav movie of all times. if tarantinos reservoir dogs was amazingly shocking this time is maturely shocking. it is just that way tarantino drives the audience that leaves me thinking. samuel l. jackson john travolta and uma thurman just rule. the scene where the last two dance at the jack rabitt slim is one of the most simple and yet beautiful dance scenes in time. so does the restaurant scene with honey bunny and pumpkin...its a total standout its that way that samuel jackson treats the situation...really a blow-out a must see. all over the movie the audience keep thinking on what if... what if i shoot right here right now yeah what its just the way tarantino plays with the wild emotions hiding into ourselves...he just blows peoples minds with this movie tarantino has to be accepted as tha master he is both directing and writing.  and though i like reservoir dogs more pulp fiction is not too far away of being as great as that. and i must say too that pulp fiction should have won the oscar that year instead of forrest gump. wrote this elsewhere copying cause i dont feel like doing a new one ill start this by saying that this may not be for everyone metacritic currently has it at a 75100 which is understandable the movie can probably be best described as the campy james bond type spy movie for the modern age it takes the risks that no bond movie will probably ever take again not since the disaster that die another day was they make no attempt to hide this and halfway through the movie make it pretty clear that its what the film is going for without breaking the fourth wall until itkind of does break the fourth wall a little to enjoy the film youre gonna have to turn off whatever part of your brain governs rationality and skepticism because the tech and gadgets used here will cause your eyes to roll if youre expecting this to be a skyfall style spy movie seeing posters for this did nothing for me when i first heard about it then the trailers grabbed my attention what i wasnt expecting was just how violent it was going to be the action sequences are over the top to the point where the agents are superhuman again youre gonna have to turn your brain off a little to enjoy it if youre incapable of doing so just dont bother seeing it if you can i think youll enjoy it most of the theater who got advanced screening tickets applauded quite loudly twice they applauded the first credit screen then partway through it there was a bonus scene more applause at the end im not quite sure how colin firth has never been cast as a gentleman secret agent before he absolutely nails it samuel l jackson is actually pretty delightful as the villain with a disdain of violence not exactly a spoiler as this detail of his character was in trailers micheal caine is actually a touch disappointing in his role i feel like they really underutilized his talents wasnt expecting mark hamill to be in it but was pleased with his appearance and his british accent was completely believable if i hadnt seen pictures of hamill prepping for star wars 7 i wouldve thought he was just some random british middle aged actor mark strong was solid in his role but nothing too fantastic the big surprise to me was taron egerton who i had to look up ill admit the lead of the film the guy who kind of looks like josh hutcherson it honestly is quite impressive to see him go from this british bruv to towards the end of the movie a sophisticated secret agent with honestly the charm and wit of james bond the transformation is believable and impressive looking back on the movie that may be my favorite thing about it and given that hes only24 i think? i dont think its completely absurd to consider him to eventually replace daniel craig maybe hes not the best choice but hes made my list might not grow out of his boyish face but if he does he should get a call anyway aside from the individual performances the movies plot is completely ludicrous in a fun way the violence is over stylized but the humor is quite fun after seeing all the comedies ive seen certain jokes are just predictable and kingsman has its share but some jokes are quite surprising tldr summary intentionally campy a lot of fun if you dont expect a serious spy film quite funny super violent at times i can only really compare it to 300actually no this is more like a spy version of kickass really but its not quite as gory more entertaining than most movies i saw last year if theres a sequel i will watch it also sophie cookson may just be my new celebrity crush and also my ticket was free through the advanced screening service im signed up for but when i find time im gonna pay to see it againin 13 ****ing days edit back to the kick ass comparison i think if this is well enough received as it was for me and the friend i took to see it it may enjoy the same cult classic status luckily forit it will come way before the big blockbusters of 2015 will hit theaters may give it enough time to gain that appreciation in my personal opinion its better than kick asswriterdirector richard linklater is no doubt one filmmaker who has not received the spotlight he deserves in the hood of hollywood he has directed such wondrous films as before sunrise before sunset before midnight school of rock dazed & confused and much more however this mid 40s boy is about to get the attention he deserves for his marvelous work in writing & directing the comingofage flick boyhood and when i say comingofage i really mean it boyhood took 12 years to film it captures the life of the young protagonist mason jr from the time he is 5 years old all the way to he is 17 it was filmed in bits and pieces in a 12 year span linklater formulates a viable authenticity in the life of a child to teenager family life insecurity identification stability discovery etc mason jr is a child of divorce and linklater develops mason jr not so much as a victim of an unstable family life but a young survivor who still maintains his noble dignity throughout lifes experiences ellar coltranes astounding performance as mason jr from child to teen is of oscar caliber ethan hawke and patricia arquette also delivered excellent work as masons divorce parents mason sr and olivia linklaters reallife daughter lorelei linklater shows that the linklater talent is being passed on quite splendidly with her solid performance as mason jrs sister samantha this is no childs play boyhood is one of the best movies of 2014 ***** excellentwriter/director quentin tarantino demonstrates his encyclopedic grasp of filmmaking by bending chopping and deconstructing narrative while keeping a groovy beat brilliant and brutal funny and exhilarating jaw-droppingly cruel and disarmingly sweet all the details are executed to perfection ironies abound in the smallest situations the experience overall is like laughing down a gun barrel a little bit tiring a lot sick and maybe far too perverse for less jaded moviegoers the movie resurrects not only an aging genre but also a few careerswriter and director quentin tarantinos pulp fiction qualified as a revelation when it came out in 1994 and time has not diminished the impact of this landmark film this crime melodrama about a pair of philosophical hit men a treacherous boxer a cocaine-snorting drug dealers wife and a cleaner shifts back and forth between tragic drama and helium comedy with irony galore if tarantino had not made any other movie he would still have been assured a niche in cinematic history with pulp fiction he juggles four complicated plot lines about an eccentric gallery of characters who are all low-lives in one way of another living on the fringe of society whether they be murderers thieves narcotics dealers sexual perverts or small-time pistol-wielding crooks pulp fiction defies chronological time because tarantino stages everything out of order this fractured form of storytelling might alienate those spectators accustomed to chronological order not one minute of this marathon two hour and forty-five minute audacity is dull ultimately tarantino and co-scenarist roger avary received the oscar for best original screenplay while the academy of motion picture arts and sciences nominated tarantino for best director the film itself for best picture john travolta for best actor sally menke for best editing and samuel l jackson and uma thurman respectively for best supporting male and female roles over ten years later pulp fiction is still outstanding largely because it is such a timeless tale of amoral mayhem tarantinos quotable dialogue his articulate underworld thugs and his archly sardonic take on life retains its vivacity inspite of the scrambled up stories tarantino plots everything very carefully foreshadowing situations and predicaments with characters facing the consequences of their actions tarantino inspired a generation of movie makers but none of them have come close to eclipsing his masterpiece pulp fiction opens in a restaurant with ringo/pumpkin tim roth of reservoir dogs discussing the various problems involved in the art of robbery with his girlfriend yolanda/honey bunny amanda plummer of the prophecyand their impulsive decision to rob the restaurant colorful credits follow and tarantino introduces us to jules samuel l jackson of shaft and vincent john travolta of saturday night fever as vincent talks about the difference between what hamburgers are called in amsterdam a quarter-pounder is called a royale with cheese and most food is referred to using the metric system they arrive at an apartment where they are supposed to pick up an attachÍ© case from four twentysomething guys as a part of a deal that went south jules questions brett frank whaley of the doors about the guys questionable business practices with jules boss marsellus wallace all the dumbfounded brett can utter after he witnesses jules shoot one of his friends on a sofa in cold blood is the word what jules warns him not to say what again nevertheless brett says what five times and jules puts a bullet in his shoulder vincent and jules retrieve the mysterious suitcase but not before another guy bursts from the bathroom with a cannon like revolver and fires indiscriminately at them the guy misses each time and jules and vincent blow him away and leave with the case and another bystander marvin phil lamarr of old dogs after they kill brettwow what can we say about this film. it is one of the best of all-time that is no question. it has altered my perceptions in a lot of ways. i had not read the books so i felt that i could safely watch the film without nit-picking at all the details the movies had left out. i found some people doing that but even those people said it was still pretty true to the story. knowing that and also getting the thrill of experiencing the lord of the rings for the first time was unbelievable. i had watched the fellowship of the ring for the first time on video and i was immediatley hooked. when two towers came out i had to see it the first day out as well as return of the king. i also did some research on tolkien after that and found some reasons of why he wrote it as well. knowing that he wrote it because he wanted to and not just to make a point was astounding to me he just loved to create characters drama and just plain good storyline. noone does that anymore yet i was truly inspired. i have never been so inspired by a movie. it literally took my breath away i believe we are all living in the lord of the rings. whatever your adventure is wherever your heart is at whatever challenges you face we can all learn from lord of the rings. there is always hope.wow what can be said about interstellar that hasnt been said before? so ill just share my thoughts and feelings about this movie the nolan brothers have hit yet another homerun with this intergalactic masterpiece the story is about a single father whos trying to raise his children and provide for them and his father in law the world is sick very sick in fact cropses are dying and harvests are lost farmers have become the worlds most important job but soon humanity or at least a very small part of it realizes earth can not be saved and that they have to turn to the stars to find salvation matthew mcconaughey has come a long way since his roles as a piece of mancandy in chickflicks and he proves it yet again here he plays his role as cooper perfectly the heartache he has to go through while making an impossible choice really pulls you into the story saving humanity or seeing his children once more anne hathaway fits the role of brand well shes not sexualized as she was in the dark knight rises which gives her the chance to win you over with her acting and win you over she will michael caine is michael caine so you know what to expect there greatness jessica chastain is wonderful as murph shes so strong yet so fragile and its just heartbreaking to watch her emotional journey cassey affleck takes on the role of murphs brother and does a great job theres one more surprise appearance by a big actor which i wont spoil for you you can already tell the acting jobs are top notch in this picture and they have to be the story touches on some existential themes which are difficult to comprehend you have to understand and feel the emotions the characters are going through to grasp the purpose of the story fully visually interstellar impresses with actual physicists working on the movie you get the most accurate pictures of unearthly events the visual of black hole gargantua is actually being used in a scientific publication the other planets the team visit are equally stunning as they are interesting without going in too much detail the planets feature things we all know but they are portrayed in a way youve never seen before now let me take the time to gush over the music in this film you may think the music isnt as important as the acting or the story but its with music this good you understand it is actually a character in the movie the music is gorgeous its epic when it needs to be and emotional when the story requires it i found myself nearly in tears over the music when i didnt expect it hans zimmer proves he can create delicate and fragile pieces of music as well as epic dark and heavy soundtracks like he has done for the dark knight trilogy so in summary interstellar isnt just a space movie it isnt a science fiction movie at heart its a movie about humanity and about saving it and not just in a literal sense its about finding our own humanity its about family its about love because that is the main theme which drives the characters its the core foundation for all their actions and choices but above all this film is about hope its about believing in ourselves and the power we can muster when we fight for our loved ones interstellar is one of the most amazing movies ive ever had the privilege to see please go see this filmwow what a movie its not only the best of the lord of the rings trilogy it also is one of the best movies of the past couple of years. the lord of the rings: the return of the king is a totally spectacular movie. it has some of the most amazing battle scenes in movie history. the word spectacular isnt good enough to describe it its breathtaking epic and emotional involving. who didnt wanted to pick up a sword and shield and charge with aragorn towards a large number of orcs for honor and glory even though the special effects are far from the best ever peter jackson is a master in mixing the special effect with real life action. the use of it never feels overdone and the result is spectacular as well as believable. i think lots of people were worried after the lord of the rings: the two towers after seeing the battle of helms deep. how was peter jackson ever going to top that great battle well with the lord of the rings: the return of the king he topped it alright the battle for middle earth is something youve never seen before. greatest moment was when the riders of rohan charged it was really a moment in which you felt the true meaning of fighting and dying with honor. also great moment during the immensely large battle were the fights against the oliphaunts just when you thought the battle was over those large creatures appeared really great moment. the characters are possibly at their best in this movie. no characters need introductions anymore and we get to see the deepest of their emotions in this movie even gollums still the movie is not really deserving to be third in the top 250 here on imdb.com. its also not really deserving all those oscars it won. like all the lord of the rings movies its great spectacular and absolutely breathtaking at times but not classic masterpieces in my book. also the movie is far from flawless. once again the editing is just poor at times and what was with the ending couldnt they just think of one ending i expected the end credits to start rolling multiple times during the ending but it just went on and on. despite some of those flaws it still is an excellent movie with some unforgettable battles sequences. truly a wonderful ending for one of the greatest movie trilogies in history. 10/10 http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/wow what a film this baby is and yes this film is one of the most brilliant films ever written by man and i for one was literally stoked from the start so as a future film maker i hope to one day make a film like this because if i do i will definitely die a happier man. the film was just awesome in every sense and i really loved the plot it had some great cliff hangers and great and classic scenes where the main character became himself more and you just fell in love with him so on that basis i would class this film as one of the all time greats and if you havent seen it yet go out and buy it because you wont be disappointed at all believe you me.wow this movie is so good

what i can further express by way of praise for the film. long live the shawshank redemption on imdb  wow this movie is incredible and very underrated yes its true the plot doesnt make much sense when you are watching it or even when you think back on it but who the hell cares its a brilliantly filmed stylish and original piece of work by a true master of cinema brian de palma there are several sequences in this film that blow my mind 1 the first job near the beginning2 the ultrastylish eyepopping breathtaking nailbiting brilliant computer room breakin sequence with tom cruise hanging from a cable on the ceilingwoah3 the scene in the restaurant with the fish tank notice how the angles on the characters when theyre talking get increasingly more crooked 4 and the mindboggling finale on the bullet train you wont believe your eyes dont watch this movie and expect it to be realistic because it isnt it is totally overthetop and implausible but its supposed to be and thats what makes it fun just realizeit is a movieand enjoy it as a fun amazing stylish brilliant thrill ridewow so many 110 & 1010 reviews seems theres something with this film that is incredibly divisive after reading many reviews heres what ive found many people forgot this is a fiction a grand glorious tale a moment of wonder and fun and adventure heres my rebuttal to all the naysayers deriding its science and improbable hero actions wizard of oz star wars watch the ending without music for a total roflmfao alice in wonderland narnia the lord of the rings only three of these stories involve wormholes two have a talking lion another has trees that walk around one has a cat that rips its own head off and turns invisible in bands and the believability of any of these movies is absolute zero good thing that theres overriding reasons to watch a film joy entertainment a fun adventure interstellar is a staggering glorious wonderful journey i left totally sated feeling light and wonderful its a beautiful brilliant rollicking through space and time 1110 purely for enjoymentwow just one word-brilliant. christopher nolan has done it again with this masterpiece. the movie has everything. it cannot be better. the highlights of the movie are obviously the joker. heath ledger has taken the movie to a better level. the brilliance of is acting has made joker more liked than the hero of the film. the dark knight is the best batman movie ever made and no one should miss this movie. this is the best movie of the century. harvey dent is also awesome in this one. the characters are really real. they look like real life characters rather than comic ones. the joker the batman harvey dent commissioner gordon rachel  alfred  fox all of them have done a mind blowing job. the movie has exciting background music done by hans zimmer. the entry of joker is surprising. and the climax of the movie is very intense.wow i honestly do not know what else to say except wow. usually superhero kind of movies do not really impress me but this one is incredible wow wow wow wow anyone who loves good directing good story lines incredible acting great art and absolute awesomeness will really really really love this movie. its going to be one of those movies that i will not forget for a very very long time. i was not so thrilled to watch the movie at first because i was very sad and shocked about what happened to heath ledger. but a few years later i was bored and decided to just a movie. i stumbled upon the dark knight and decided to try and watch the first half and if i didnt like ill just look for another movie to watch. well the movie was amazing that i was was hocked from the first few minutes. i was watching intently the whole time. r.i.p to the amazing heath ledger. what an incredible and an unforgettable performance you will be badly missed if you havent watched this masterpiece then i recommend you do.wow christopher nolan created an absolutely amazing batman movie. i loved everything about the movie. batman was always my favorite superhero. i watched batman begins all the time as a kid and it became a favorite of mine. then i saw the dark knight in a movie theater when i was 7 or 8 and i was totally blown away by it. the dark knight was perfectly casted. christian bale made an incredible batman heath ledger as the joker was the best acting performance of all time and i doubt anyone will top it anytime soon. there were so many great scenes like the interrogation scene the chase scene the bank heist intro joker crashing the party joker exploding the hospital and jokers magic pencil trick. batman is the best superhero ever and the joker is the best super villain ever and the dark knight is the best movie sequel ever.words cannot explain the thoughts i have on this movie unlike the new xmen i think the more you think about it the more you like it although both movies were equally good guardians has a good humor vibe throughout the movie with a compelling plot and an ultimately brilliant outcome of a movie i may even see it again i have read the comics before the movie was thought of and let me tell you it was very true to the characters and let me say i had doubts about vin diesels talent between groots small role in speech but now i dont think anybody else could have matched how well he performed marvel can surely be at the top of greatness at the moment with its movies however i highly doubt that and i cannot wait for the next installment of superhero action brought to us by marvel roll on josh brolin and his take on thanoswonderful movie by all standards i did not find any faults worth mentioning cast: wonderful output: terrific production: excellent everything perfectly i loved all the actors and the roles that they performed ----------------------------------------------- battles: the last thing ..... frankly i did not watch the epic movie to such a degree battles give you a real sense of performance the story in general is very beautiful and not where any faults worth mentioning the course of the story as well as a very very same story excellent cutting scenes excellent graphics filming of professional. i do not know what to say more than one piece only ... thanks to everyone who contributed to this wonderful workwithout doubt one of the most endearing stories to touch the human soul. very rare a film succeeds in taking the mantle away from the novel. however this is one of those cases when it simply just does. this soul finding awe inspiring against all the odds film is a great adaptation of stephen kings 1982 novella entitled rita hayworth and shawshank redemption. this is the film that will make you think that there is hope in the world and that with great perseverance anything can be over come. set in the times of what looks like the depression and located within the backdrop of the sleepy south of america. a man sent to prison for life for a crime he did not commit and how this alien world of the lower reaches of society seem at first that he will be broken and beaten and either die or go mad as so many of the inmates succumb to. as simon and garfunkel had their books and poetry to protect them me so the lead character andy dufresne has his to protect him from such failings. in rita hayworth he has a passage of physical escape as opposed to the virtual world of books. he gains respect over time not through physical violence but by the craft of his mind and sheer willpower. like a chess master he is thinking several moves ahead of everyone. even the old master lag played by morgan freeman can only watch this man from a distance. however he relays through mainly past tense commentary how this man was as gb shaw would say was superman. eventually like a great master he exposes the lieshypocrisy and greed of the evil church going warden. this is not a film but a journey to the very survival of the human soul and as the lead character passes through leads a golden light on those condemned even if only for a passing moment in time. like a bird on a journey he is destined to be free. enjoy this film because it may if only for a moment save your soul.with well adapted characters more direction than a compass and loads more power than a puch from mike tyson this film is an absolute must-see. tarintino the director which brought us reservior dogs and true romance has created what i claim as a top 10 in cinematic history.  casablanca one flew over the cuckoos nest raging bull the godfather reservoir dogs schindlers list tgtbtu taxi driver goodfellas l.a confidential apocalypse now fight club and so on and so forth. i would recommend this or the godfather for any person that wants to get in movies. since both are classics and impossible to dislike. 11/10 with the final installment coming through everybody can recognize the greatness of not only the return of the king but of the trilogy as a whole. despite not being a fan of fantasy movies i was completely taken by the magic of the story and particularly peter jacksons incredible ability to transform such a complicated story into an epic movie and raise the scales of film making. the return of the king grabs audiences and places them in with the characters one by one. it is no surprise at all for the movie to swap 11 oscars and we all surely will be looking to the upcoming two installments of the hobbit to see if peter jackson can outdo himself. rating: 10/10with Óäbatman beginsÓ_ by christopher nolan tried something brash . a reboot to the film path of the famous hero of dc comics who had already experienced four transfers to the big screen with the original inspired top touch of burton. the 2005 film  however constituted a more management - an attempt to prepare the hero  something that you would complete in a future sequel despite an expected attractive adventure . and because the cinema management and preparations -profile within the limits of the sail hardly enjoy direct assessment and acceptance the challenge is quickly forgotten . as the next ... the Óädark knightÓ_ is a film haunted . the question that arises is whether this feeling is due solely to the unexpected death of ledger and expenses  presence on the big screen . there is a flood of stimuli that attack you throughout the course of the film and this is enough to convince that the film not only enjoyed by the tragic circumstances of a death . in one scenario is pervasive gloomy atmosphere and as the story progresses it becomes increasingly conscious . traditional clichÍ©s blockbusters canceled by anarchist way  particularly in the second half  where anything can go wrong goes and all that is dominated by death and loss . all main characters dominate the screen without nevertheless thwarted action . the bale experiencing two natures hero literally torn . the eckhart - probably the most favored role screenplay - initially posing charming hypnotized us as soon as his character changes the standards . the oldman despite strictly earthly existence of the role is never on the sidelines . the maggie gyllenhaal and loses if the impressions in the last scene of overall standing in the only decent actress . the morgan freeman and michael caine can not help but complement beautifully cast in two key roles . make no mistake  though. the true protagonist of Óädark knightÓ_ no different from heath ledger and the joker . is itself a living horror  a freak storyline than their worst nightmares . in some scenes may remind you of a psychotic alter-ego of edward scissorhands or something of the unique otherworldly figure of hannibal lecter. thanks to him much the movie looks so dark and threatening. personally at least  it took me a few seconds to inspiration magic scene input to  forget  that the same role was impersonate the great nicholson. combining creative logic of a blockbuster with a full script and insightful directorial eye of nolan the Óädark knightÓ_ gives the best explanation for the original intentions of Óäbatman beginsÓ_. in a film where various identified - operational - oddly  it is not surprising that the major disadvantage is also a paradox . there is so much to 145 minutes can hardly meet the viewer from only one view . despite the apparent lack of economy  however  the  dark knight  looks capable resurrect halls in lean periods . and do not be surprised if you found high in the preferences for the upcoming oscars without going necessarily refer only to level roles ledger background music or art direction . sorry for bad english :with more than 3000 reviews there isnt much to say about this masterpiece. but it deserves many more reviews. this is a film of a lifetime. seriously. it crosses all the lines of its genre in order to give all of us a showcase of every name involved. not only christian bale or health ledger are unforgettable. everything in this movie camera script performances story action direction is at the highest and beyond. its a movie made with style and groundbreaking aces on the hood. it could be shocking that this movie is so considered in all film lists across the world. but be prepared to be moved and surprised. at present day the filmmakers can still deliver masterpieces to audiences than can destabilized the ancient classics. this is a new classic. and it even deserves the #5 spot for me. my own parents guide: sex & nudity: 1/10. very poor content of this and just passionate kisses. violence & gore: 8/10. this is not a so violent or graphic movie but when it comes its really intense and sometimes upsetting the jump scene with the false batman two face looking most of joker attacks against people which includes plant an explosive inside a man stomach kill one man with the infamous magic trick scene.... profanity: 5/10. some language but not so remarkable. alcohol/drugs/smoking: 3/10. very poor content again. nothing too much relevant. frightening/intense scenes: 10/10. its not about frightening except for the jump scene but it does about intensity. the whole movie is brilliantly dark and extremely real with people and situations really hard and truly moving at times. this is the most intense batman movie. even more intense and violent than the next one: rises. total: 27/50. despite this can be a so low mark of explicit content in a so convoluted movie like this one its a really not for kids movie and one of the most intense superhero movies ever. and the most disturbing in batman trilogy.with all of the talk about heath ledger getting an oscar i feel that it is only right to state that that was not him. arkham mustve given the joker an early parole to appear here because for all accounts that was the joker i saw on screen as this was the most realistic portrayal of my favorite villain that i have ever seen. it has been a long time since i have clapped at the end of a movie but it seems i was not alone as most of the packed audience i was viewing with had to agree. this has to be considered one of the best movies of the year the scope and vistas were spectacular and this was batmans against the joker in a tour de force effort that both the writer and producer should be proud ofwith a director like david fincher you can expect a few things the man has a speciality for creating extremely effective thrillers and hes also very good at adapting and being faithful to source material such as 2011s the girl with the dragon tattoo gone girl is a bestselling novel from 2012 written by gillian flynn who also wrote the screenplay and stated that it deviates from the novel i can confidently say it has been a long time since ive gone to the theatre and been captivated by an entire movie sure there has been some stellar pictures out this year but to actually sit down and be absorbed into a 2 hour 30 minute film and want more from it by the end is very impressive considering a majority of the years biggest movies appear during awards season nick dunne ben affleck and his wife amy rosamund pike seem to be the ideal couple from humble beginnings to a whirlwind engagement at face value no one could doubt how flawless a couple they seem eventually on the day of their fifth anniversary amy goes missing nick calls the police who do their duty yet after studying the apparent home invasion remain suspicious her disappearance creates a media frenzy turned witchhunt and nicks behaviour and surfacing lies surrounding the marriage are interpreted by the media and public as characteristics of a sociopath did nick kill his wife? and just where is amy? two words easily sum up gone girl for me riveting and haunting american suburbia is turned upside down and the many clues left behind for nick become more engrossing as he remains onestep ahead of the everyone nick and amy are the kind of characters that will jettison an actor into a household name ben affleck continues to do extremely solid work these past couple of years and with that said this is easily rosamund pikes finest hour and if theres any justice she is easily going to win acclaim for her performance its good to see neil patrick harris and tyler perry leave comedy behind once in a while because if this is the result then i was also wonderfully engrossed finally kim dickens missi pyle and the screen debut of carrie coon complete this casting jigsaw puzzle david fincher always gets the most out of his cast according to producer ce_n chaffin fincher took on average as many as 50 takes for each scene and everyone just feels natural what is left to say is that the music by trent reznor and atticus ross is fantastic and finchers camera work is as sublime as ever shadows and light help blur how events unfold many shots look good enough to go on a postcard and the way how your support and opinion of a character can change as the movie progresses baffles me how they pulled it off this well even though the finale may be a big turnoff for some people it ends ambiguously enough to never set the future in stone and doesnt betray such an impressive atmosphere the film has continuously grown from the beginning final verdict i really liked it and i dont how i could make that fact more clearer gillian flynn does justice to her work and the result is probably one of 2014s best thrillers and could possibly be my favourite film of the year so far its always great to see a david fincher movie be so familiar and so well crafted to the level weve come to expect from him 1010with a director like david fincher

are interesting each one of them got something that makes them so real  5  the dialogues so so real  you feel like its random talks by real people from real life not actors playing a role in a film  6  so many awesome scenes  7  one of the greatest dances ever in a film  mei & vincent  8  you can re watch it anytime and enjoy it  because the more you watch it  the more you discover things happen that you havent notice from the first time  9  this film is by quentin tarantino  10  its already rate 90why so serious christopher nolans the dark knight is a critically acclaimed movie that skyrocketed the batman franchise back into popularity among youth and adults alike. the movie has already been rated as possibly one of the greatest movies of all timewhy shawshank redemption isnt rated 9.9/10 is beyond me. what has caused me to reflect and comment on this film is the small things...99.9% of movies miss them. a movie is a photographic montage of images with sound and is meant to represent a story. humans have always enjoyed stories from time immemorial huddled around fires in caves to modern things like facebook or youtube its all about stories. shawshank has many small instances that frank darabont included like when red leaves a small note to andy with a free poster when he returns from the hospital/isolation. another small instance is when andy gives red the harmonica it could easily not have been filmed but it touches everyone with its deeper meanings. its a collage of many small instances that make it meaningful and memorable over and over again. i am convinced thats why everyone loves this movie and watch it repeatedly its the small things that touch you. how many movies have given you the most important small message of all...of hope...its the most powerful of goals we can have hope really sets you free.why is the dark knight so serious for many good reasons. christopher nolan is a true auteur who can take a simplistic comic book story like batman and turn it into a complex psychological movie with plethora of character study. he has directed christian bale into the most serious batman character of all. he sure did direct the late heath ledger into performing as the best joker of them all and ledger did not work to upstage bale or the other actors in any way. ledger should definitely win a posthumous oscar for his scary performance of a clown who possesses deep wounds. if christopher nolan was old enough he should have done batman movies instead of tim burton or joel schumacher put together. tim burtons mood was dark as well but as im looking at it now michael keaton was a more sloppy batman kim basinger was a mousy vicky vale and jack nicholson overdid his joker performance. in batman returns also directed by burton and starring keaton the commercialism continues adding michelle pfeiffer as a more idiotic catwoman than the catwomen on the 1960s tv series and danny devito who still was a wounded penguin but not enough that we feel sorry for him. then in the mid 1990s keaton didnt want to play batman anymore feeling he was upstaged by all the villains. looking for more actors often typecast as villains director schumacher got tommy lee jones to parody his villain persona as harvey two-face dent. also there was still that rubberface persona in jim carrey as the riddler as well. 1997s batman and robin was a total washout. so nolan came to rescue this moribund franchise and made his own franchise moody with dark colors mature less focus on the action and more on the story and detailed development of each character without exploiting them. in 2005 batman begins was just the beginning but the dark knight is the real story. it would be sin that christopher nolan does not get nominated for an oscar just as well as heath ledger for best director. christian bale is and many people would agree with me the best batman of them all. with his rich performance we do know him better than adam west michael keaton val kilmer and george clooney put together. we know bruce waynes haunted past and demons and why he becomes his alter ego batman to fight crime in gotham city. unlike cesar romero and jack nicholson heath ledger is a much more complicated joker. he doesnt torture people just for pure torture. he doesnt laugh maliciously between every single sentence. he grew up with such an abusive upbringing that he wants to exploit batman as a fraud for gotham city even bringing in batman clones with the typical caped crusader outfit on the crime scenes just to tell bruce wayne will the real batman stand up all the other actors give excellent detailed performances. maggie gyllenhal gives a stronger performance than katie holmes mrs. tom cruise as bruce waynes love interest assistant d.a. rachel dawes but is smitten with d.a. harvey dent aaron eckhart in the end. gary oldman in one of his few good-guy roles does a fine turn as the mustachioed commissioner gordon more serious than the one weve seen on tv. veteran thespians michael caine and morgan freeman are always a treat to watch as the faithful butler alfred and the gadget inventor lucius fox. these two men get better with age each time they make movies. and aaron eckhart plays harvey two-face dent not as a torturous villain like tommy lee jones did before but as a victim wounded by the jokers torture in a gas chamber out to seek revenge with his coin as his calling card for what could be good or what could better yet turn out for bad on his intended targets. the summer of 2008 had a lot of movies. ive seen mamma mia as a light feel-good musical comedy riddled with off-key singing notably by pierce brosnan. ive seen wall-e which i thought was pixars blander efforts. remy the rat from last year upstaged this robot on all costs. but the dark knight is the best movie of the summer. when it comes to comic book stories as i said before directors burton and schumacher got all caught up in themselves with too much action and seemed to forget their audiences. nolan never does.  there is nothing to say. it is just exceptionally plain good. a must to see movie for everyone that carries a heart. why do i want to write the 234th comment on the shawshank redemption i am not sure - almost everything that could be possibly said about it has been said. but like so many other people who wrote comments i was and am profoundly moved by this simple and eloquent depiction of hope and friendship and redemption. the only other movie i have ever seen that effects me as strongly is to kill a mockingbird. both movies leave me feeling cleaner for having watched them. i didnt intend to see this movie at all: i do not like prison movies and i dont normally watch them. i work at a branch library and one day as i was checking the shawshank redemption out to one of our older patrons she said to me whenever i feel down or depressed i check out this movie and watch it and it always makes me feel better. at the time i thought that was very strange. one day there was nothing on tv except things i absolutely would not watch under any circumstance or things that i had seen too many times already. i remembered what she said so i watched it. i have watched it many many times since then and it gets better with every showing. no action no special effects - just men in prison uniforms talking to each other. the shawshank redemption and to kill a mockingbird are the best movies i have ever seen. i do not judge it by its technical merits - i dont really care about that. i have read that citizen kane or the godfather or this or that movie is the best movie ever made. they may have the best technique or be the most influential motion pictures ever made but not the best. the best movies are ones that touch the soul. it takes a movie like the shawshank redemption to touch the soul.who would have thought colin firth could play such a suave james bond type? he displays enough cockiness looks quite dapper in his custom made suite and can probably pick up any babes he wished if we had more time in the movie jackson also has the time of his life with his speech impediment villain in addition to that we are treated to the training phase of the future spies and unlike birdman where theres nothing funny this parody skewers the genre giving us action fan plenty to cheer throughout the entire movie we have the gadgets the action scenes the incredible requests to earn certification and become a member of the select few we meet the fatherless hero who must prove himself worthy of the recognition and hone his natural talents to be able to save the world who wouldnt love the poisonous tip oxfords the cool pens key chains and doesnt that umbrella come in pretty handy before and during a lethal encounter? in order to give the film more panache we have to include michael caine who has already graced a few batman films with his class and mark strong adds a touch of cerebral ability as he must prove his resources are after all important to succeed in this era what is most important here is the amount of fun we have throughout the film? loved the intimate dinner between the two adversaries the sexy villain who proves to be quite a challenge during the entire adventure and it is plenty of fun to see some of those selected few get their due as they find themselves once again worthy of salvation just because they have more money than the rest of the world of course the villain plans are both hideous and hilarious as we see which groups are depicted in the movie most of them are one step short of getting into that type of frenzy anyway so it wouldnt take much to trigger that type of behavior this is a movie that is a bit over two hours but we dont want it to end because it is so much fun there are films out there that are overpraised because it looks like theyre trying to be original as they criticize satirize or make a halfhearted and pretentious parody of other genres kingsman is an example that the film makers are able to wink an eye and tell us these types of films are excessive with just too much of nothing in order to pack it with special effects to hide its creative weaknesses but this one also shows that you can show intelligent commentaries without dragging or calling too much attention to it i cant remember how many times i look at my time during birdman but i had forgotten i had a watch or a cell phone while i laughed and rooted for the heroes and villains equally and there were a few unexpected turns which gave me some faith about the simple fact that we can still hope to find some fresh material out there we might getting too much of the marvel universe with a break needed soon it is also important to note that originality and creativity and their blend with comedy and action are really difficult when they were done a good work of art doesnt try that hard to call attention to itself instead its all there and it flows naturally on its way to its welldeserved recognition without the overeager critical support to tell us how great it is when it really isntwhilst some may argue it is over-long the return of the king is simply too powerful with too many wonderful elements and is ultimately too great an achievement to not be in my list of favourite films of all time peter jacksons adaption of this story whilst having the occasional stumble along the way was ultimately stunning. this film ties up the themes of the previous two instalments of which there are many in an emotional tour de force on a rather grand scale. when you have performances from a top-notch cast in a film about ideas as fundamentally moving as this you are hardly going to go wrong and at the centre of it all is the friendship between frodo and sam so brilliantly played by elijah wood and sean austin. friendship loyalty sacrifice love and the struggles we all face can be found committed to film in the intense few hours of the return of the king. the reason lord of the rings worked so well is that it did not become a stage for special effects which are wonderful as shown in scenes of battling with a giant spiderwhile batman begins was all about batman the dark knight is all about the joker... the perfect villain as they sayperhaps there hasnt been any character so evil or any actor so perfectly portraying the evil. heath ledger has outdone all his previous performances with just this one role of his hope he were with us to give us more such enthralling performances. r.i.p. the movie is going to be remembered for ages to come but not because in the end the good wins over the evil but specifically for the evil. ledger according to me has done the best performance in a negative role in the decade. the director christopher nolan has lived up to his reputation that he created with the following kept up with memento the prestige insomnia and batman begins and looks like the young director to watch out for along with zack snyder and robert rodriguez.am anxiously waiting for his inception coming this year.whether real or fiction if a story presents to us an example of loves transformational power it is a story worthy of our attention the reason so many of us do not waste our time learning how to love those who are difficult to love is that such a love requires a great amount of courage on our part first we must be willing to face and embrace every dark aspect of ourselves no matter how large we imagine our imperfections to be no matter how great our sense of shame over our past mistakes may be secondly to love one who is at first difficult to love also requires that we soften ourselves enough to be changed if we go the distance in learning how to love in this way the process will always transform us for the better unfortunately we do not have a lot of examples in our cultures movies books or stories of what such a transformational act of love looks like fortunately disneys film maleficent gives us such an example to all who participated in the production of this film i say well done beautiful story beautiful imagery beautifully acted and beautifully produced i felt my heart was glowing as i left the movie theaterwhere to begin with this movie this is truly my favourite movie and one of the best movies of the last decade. that is no understatement. from the start you are drawn in into a movie which depicts the demise of gotham city and the emergence of a truly great actor in ledgers depiction of the joker. why is the movie so perfect its quite simplewhere do i start when i first heard of the shawshank redemption i immediately wanted to watch it mostly of its title so as i always do i looked it up on imdb and looked at the rating. it was the highest ranked movie on imdb and of course i would give it a go. the beginning was very interesting with andy being convicted of double homicide and seeing the lean-back of what happened. him being found guilty serving two life sentences in the toughest prison in america shawshank. i thought it would be another overrated boring movie like the godfather but no it caught my attention from the start and never lost it either. the dramatic scenes it gives you a glance of how it is in prison the emotional scenes. it is all a masterpiece there is a reason to why it is the best movie i have ever watched and probably will ever watch. the amazing acting plot and moderate length. the last scene with red walking up the beach towards andy and the credits slowly rolling in it makes you beg for it to never end. when it comes to movies i can sometimes get a little emotional if its a good movie which shawshank is. it definitely deserves the spot as #1 i cannot understand how it didnt win an oscar. i really recommend this movie to anyone who wants a good weekend but get a load of potato chips and soda since you will finish it all up very fast.where do i start those who have already seen this movie dont need a review and those who havent will probably never look at my review given the multitudes of others to choose from. so ill just say how this movie personally affected me as a fan of the books and of movies in general. i absolutely loved the original film fellowship of the ring and did enjoy the two towers though not as much. i loved the emotion of the original subtle scenes like frodos long decision-making boatside scene at the end and found that the two towers was great in action and scope but as a result sort of put character development and characters feelings into the background. but this makes sense as the book it was based on dealt more with action and also had the burden of introducing half a dozen important new characters. return of the king however is just simply fantastic. i try to avoid statements like gets everything right and i enjoyed every minute of it but in this case its true. i was so moved at the presentation of this film that i couldnt help getting misty at the end despite knowing exactly what would happen based on the books of course. i credit this to not only the great performances but also the stirring music annie lennoxs moving into the west is a beautiful tune and perfectly echoes the sentiments of the films themes. and also i couldnt help being moved knowing that it was now all over and there will probably never be another lord of the rings epic of this magnitude in my lifetime and rightfully so. i just felt like i was saying goodbye to old friends. the movie although beginning with an important flashback begins immediately where the second film concluded and every character has a conclusion. the main part of this movie that i loved is the simple fact that no character is shortchangedwhere do i even begin with the lord of the rings trilogy it is one of the finest film trilogies to ever make it to the big screen. peter jackson was admittedly an unexpected choice of director for the trilogy. before lord of the rings he made the frighteners bad taste meet the feebles and heavenly creatures. heavenly creatures was his first step out of absurd cinema and then after the frighteners came out in 1996 the lord of the rings: the fellowship of the ring was released in 2001 and became a critical commercial and prestigious success. the two towers had the same success in 2002 and finally the return of the king came and was the greatest of the lord of the rings trilogy and the first ever fantasy movie to win the academy award for best picture and went on to win the bafta for best film and the golden globe for best picture - drama. the return of the king won all these awards for the right reasons. it was epic gorgeous a story that has been told consistently great from start to finish and everything works. lord of the rings is one of those tales that will live on forever and ever. j.r.r. tolkien would be extremely proud even if his son christopher isnt proud of the movies. the lord of the rings: the return of the king will be remembered and still be considered one of the finest movies ever made. an achievement on an epic cinematic level and a cultural milestone.whenever this movie comes on i have to watch it. this movie is very compelling and if you have not seen it im not going say much to spoil it for you. this movie takes place over a few decades of wrongful imprisonment of a banker who is accused of killing his wife. the time spent in prison is sought with so many horrors as i saw it especially for a man who never should have been imprisoned. the end is great and after the movie is over they just leaving you hanging on a whats next like no other. i have seen many movies leaving you or trying to leave you hanging but every time i see the shawshank redemption i wonder what occurred after the beach.whenever i talk about this movie with my friends i do not even refer to it by title but rather as the movie. when i say the movie my friends know exactly what im talking about. in fact the main reason that me and my friends dont refer to it by title is because this movie is so great that we do not feel worthy enough to say its name in vain i still remember the first time i saw the shawshank redemption. some friends of mine and i went to see it at one of those budget theaters over the summer of 1995. none of us really knew anything about the movie but we had heard that it was pretty good. so not having any real expectations we saw it. when the final credits rolled and the lights came on in the theater all of us just sat there with our jaws hanging down on the floor. i turned my head towards my friend bob and said that was the greatest movie i have ever seen in my entire life theres really no other way i can put it in words. every moment of this movie captivated me and inspired me to believe in the one true thing in life...... hope. this movie is sad uplifting inspiring harsh cold funny at the right times jaw-dropping and heart-warming all at the same time. i get chills every time i watch this film and this film contains the greatest ending which takes place over the last 30 minutes or soin movie history how it all just comes together is so incredible and uplifting. i should also mention the music in this movie is nearly flawless as well and the soundtrack is a must buy for any music fan. the only bad thing about this movie is the fact that i know i will never see a better movie no matter how many i may see. ive seen many movies over the past few years many excellent films. however every time i walk out of the theater i turn to my friend or family member that i saw it with and i say that was a great movie but it wasnt nearly as good as you know what there have been many movies over the past few years that thought would really move me or that i might one day call my favorite of all time but theyve all fallen far short of the shawshank redemption. so if you have yet to see this movie please run to the video store immediately. youre guaranteed to find it in the employee picks section. and if it isnt in that section then you should tell the employees there that there is something seriously wrong with them. if you have seen this movie go see it again. if you havent bought your own copy yet buy one. in fact buy two and put one in a fire-proof safe just in case of an emergency. :o so you want a 1-10 rating i give it a 13  casablanca one flew over the cuckoos nest raging bull the godfather reservoir dogs schindlers list tgtbtu taxi driver goodfellas l.a confidential apocalypse now fight club and so on and so forth. i would recommend this or the godfather for any person that wants to get in movies. since both are classics and impossible to dislike. 11/10 whenever i see a prison or even think about it the first thing that comes to my mind is this film. maybe its because i have watched this masterpiece so many times that its actually made a place inside my head and will never go away. i just cannot explain how well this film is made. the direction and screenplay by frank darabont and the fact that it is based upon rita hayworth and shawshank redemption by stephen king makes it highly likable. moving on to the performances by tim robbins as andy dufresne and morgan freeman as ellis boyd red redding they shine just like a diamond stupendous performances by them. i still cant believe that it never got any major accolade and didnt even make much money but still it has developed into something sensational which cant be missed.when you think of great films you think of pulp fiction inception se7en the godfather and the dark knight. this is because of its brilliant acting captivating storyline interesting characters and excellent dialogue. the dark knight has all of these things. as everyone knows heath ledgers performance was spectacular and aaron eckhart as harvey dent. it is directed and co-written by christopher nolan inception memento and co-written by david s. goyer man of steel blade. it has just the right mix of action character development emotion and jokes. all in all it is a classic movie and will live on through out the ages as the best superhero film of all time.when you look at imdbs top 250 you see many famous and ambitious films like star wars the godfather the lord of the rings and others. not saying that these movies are bad they are actually quite brilliant they were made famous because of the publicity and the abilities these films had in the time. star wars started the sci-fi age the godfather made people interested in the secret society of the mafia and lord of the rings brought life into the fantasy genre again. but what really made these sublime films so popular was the publicity and the fantastic special effects which costed certain amounts of money. in 1994 frank darabont decided to have a go on one of stephen kings novels not knowing what would happen. they made a film that is honest and that contains on the contrary to star wars etc. a vital lesson a meaning and a message to all who watch it. this movie is redefining cinema. no explosions. no heart-stopping excitement. no its pure poetry music and sublime acting. the overwhelming and intriguing story introduces banker andy dufresne played by tim robbins who was falsely convicted for a double life sentence in the heavily guarded establishment of shawshank prison. his life must go on and he makes friends with other inmates like red wonderfully acted out by morgan freeman and brooks hatlen james whitmore brings tears to your eyes. warden norton played immensely evil by bob gunton and captain hadley clancy brown dont make andys life comfortable in the prison but with andys unique skills he manages to win their attention and gratitude. this film has some terrific moments like the helicopter shot over the shawshank prison and the stunningly beautiful scene where andy locks himself up in the wardens office and plays mozart to all the inmates. morgan freemans raw voice makes this moment more powerful than any other moment in any other movie i ever saw. at the release of the film people criticised the film harshly and wasnt a big hit certainly not at the box-office. but when the film appeared in the stores it became an enormous hit. and until this day for over 4-5 years now i believe it stands on the second place in the top 250 one place away from the godfather. this is a film you have to see once in your lifewhen we learned about the new batman series i thought it would be a total failure. batman begins really proved me wrong and i was set up to be pleased if each of them was as good as batman begins. lets just say this movie blew away the first one and 99.9% of every other movie ever made. bale played batman perfectly the best yet. what really made this movie as good as it is was heath ledgers performance as the joker. it was one of the greatest performances ever he simply nailed it. michael caine was the usual michael caine he was great. another person that made the movie as good as it was is aaron eckhart he played harvey dent just like i imagined harvey dent. then when he became two face and his personality and whole character changed he nailed it too. of course gyllenhaal and freeman were great as well and the rest of the cast. if you havent seen this then do yourself a huge favor and see it.when the name christopher nolan comes to mind we think of memento the prestige inception and the dark knight trilogy as films that changed challenged and kept audiences in awe of what each of those films bring but his latest offering is indeed not only up there with the best scifi themed films such as inception gravity and 2001 a space odyssey as it plays an inspiration for interstellar along with other acclaimed science fiction classics but one of the best and original pieces of film made this year ill try not to give too much away but the story is centered on a not too distant future where the earth has become unsustainable for the human population dust storms scour the land and mankind itself has reverted to crop farming for food but with little luck to boot cooper matthew mcconaughey is widowed and once was a nasa test pilot and engineer but resides now as a crop farmer alongside his teenage son tom younger daughter murphy or murph as her nickname and fatherinlaw donald murph believes that ghosts are trying to communicate her and they have given her coordinates of a possible location to discover but it leads to secret nasa group lead by professor brand michael cane who theorizes that a possible wormhole discovered orbiting saturn could lead to possible new worlds for human colonisation and asks for coopers help in leading the expedition along with his daughter amelia anne hathaway and 2 other nasa astronauts the events that follow take off will lead to an adventure like no other thats visually spectacular emotional and engaging as said nolan has topped this works with this marvelous gem being based by theoretical physicist kip thornes work nolan gives us the scenario of human life in another universe and taking 4 years to write the most realistic script alongside his brother jonathan the final result was indeed different to what i and others were expecting the direction as always is spot on as already seen in his last films he takes story seriously pace is steady but never broken and characters are never wasted in his vision the amount of time that was taken to be convinced on screen was a long journey for nolan and his crew through financing development writing etc but the end result was indeed captivating and a step up in terms of science fiction in film the casting and performances are all fantastic these include oscar winners matthew mcconaughey anne hathaway michael caine and jessica chastain and a surprising appearance of another one but i wont be revealing thisthe supporting talents of wes bentley topher grace john lithgow casey affleck and the voices of bill irwin and josh stewart are all  mcconaughey in particular has amped up his acting roles since his role in the lincoln lawyer and only this year won best actor for dallas buyers club he gives not only a realistic depiction of man losing not only his reason for existence but yet redeem it all for the sake of mankind but he conveys emotion hope and yet convincing enough to be the films hero hathaway similarly does this as well with excellence and has driven herself to be involved in captivating films since les miserables expanding her acting range the topping performance of all in my opinion  was jessica chastain since seeing zero dark thirty she can be incredible in drama driven roles and breathing life into her characters so im betting she will get oscar attention alongside mcconaughey and hathaway music here is incredibly captivating and who else to deliver this is award winning and highly acclaimed composer hans zimmer a favorite of mine to listen to to describe intersellars zimmer says that the textures the music and the sounds and the thing we sort of created has sort of seeped into other peoples movies a bit so its time to reinvent the endless string ostinatos need to go by the wayside the big drums are probably in the bin and like 2001 the music is beautiful and plays a role in the storys emotion visual effects here are becoming more cgi than practical but nolan highly prefers the practical magic and minor cgi to bring the realistic effect the use of miniature effects built and designed sets and production are all in for oscar worthy attention and this was possible because of visual effects team double negative overall interstellar is a captivating engaging and emotional film release of the year and only a year after gravity had changed the mold on science fiction but interstellar adds more with its concept cast music and atmosphere that creates a beautiful journey to the unknown that will indeed earn oscars wins in the next awards seasonwhen the dark knight was first released everyone was going to see it even if they hadnt seen the previous batman begins simply because it was heath ledgers last completed role - and what a role it was. when you watch the film for the first ten minutes when you see heath on screen you remember how he is sadly no longer with us and are reminded of the tragedy. however when the joker visits the mob and performs the pencil trick heath becomes the joker. its a rare occasion when you find a character so well performed that you forget its an actor but heath did this astonishingly well. its hard to find a weak link in the acting in this film. christian bale adds an almost comical edge to bruce wayne with his hints of mockery when it comes to talking to or about harvey dent. bale also performs batman well despite the odd voice which you get used to. aaron eckhart is another actor whose performance is excellent. his noble character of harvey dent is great but its when he becomes two-face that you really see eckharts skill. its a shame this side of his character is only shown for the final part of the film but he like heath ledger is able to totally immerse himself in the character. the familiar characters played by gary oldman and morgan freeman are welcomed again in this sequel and maggie gyllenhaals replacement of katie holmes as rachel dawes is also not controversial and maggie acts very well. the script itself is full of twists and turns and leaves you gasping for the finishing half of the entire film. christopher nolan has done an excellent job with this film. perhaps not his best ever script but its definitely his best film so far it will be difficult for him to create the sequel for this film as he has simply made an excellent film here which is difficult to beat.when someone tells me words cannot express i typically laugh at the absurdity as a writer i conceitedly believe that there are always words for everything however i must bow to this clich_ words cannot express what i think of richard linklaters boyhood given that its been a little over 12 hours since i saw the film and im still speechless i ask you to bear with me in this review i will monologue to state that boyhood is the best film of a year thats not but _ of the way through is a stretch but i find myself limber in this instance boyhood is the best film of the year now time to stretch some more boyhood is the best film of the decade still limber no stretching needed this movie is that incredible it all began with an innovative idea from the already innovative richard linklater what if we see a family grow and age through the eyes of a child? and what if we shot it in realtime? from there a spark was ignited and eventually came to a glorious flame we do see a family age for 12 years this idea is already a selling point for the film but then throw in mr linklaters usual touch of heart and authenticity and youll have something undeniably special youll have an intimate epic a film that is so large in a technical scale and equally large in emotional sale is something hardly seen especially in the past 12 years so when boyhood premiered at the sundance film festival there was a lot hype and this excitement hasnt expired after several months instead it has grown it has traveled through america crafting an astute reputation for the film to follow so for filmgoers like myself who live in small unartistic towns find ourselves overwhelmed with praise for a film we must wait for and we did i personally waited a full monthandahalf for this film to hit el paso but 6 weeks is nothing compared to 12 years so i shall cease my complaining instead i shall say this boyhoods reputation precedes itself as the film opens were are introduced to mason the central character the boy in boyhood he is six years old and the year is 2002 this is when we begin our 12 year journey with him at the end of the school day mason is picked up by his mother olivia an electric patricia arquette early on in the film we get a sense of the living conditions of olivia but instead of shifting the narrative towards her we stick with mason and remain oblivious to the full condition of olivias life in many instances there is nothing heard or seen that mason isnt hearing or seeing if his parents are fighting in the next room we dont see it because mason doesnt see it after a few minutes mason spends time with his father ethan hawke at his finest mason sr is just what youd expect hes your typical absentee dad one who only shows up with gifts and fun but never seems to be serious about raising a family however since we see things as mason does this dad is awesome and greatly missed at this point the plot becomes clear this is a film about a broken family to scrutinize the plot would be to write an 1115 page review there is so much going on within each year of the film that the 12 year story is impossible to break down into a simple synopsis after the first 1215 minutes of the movie the film cuts to a new year 2003 and we find the characters have moved on from the last this process is continued throughout the entire film till we reach adulthood in 2013 and with this formula a masterpiece is crafted there is something so psychologically groundbreaking about this film never before has a film been so relatable so memorable and so poignant as each year appears on the screen we the audience subconsciously immerse ourselves into the same time period we recall what we thought and did in that year and find ourselves nostalgic this feeling is especially effective for members of masons generation like myself we recall the same thought patters and experiences mason goes through as we went through them with this intimacy we find ourselves reliving our childhood this beautiful feeling is something no other film has caused this is why boyhood is so groundbreaking because it is able to captivate its audience and allow us to have a relationship with it what mr linklater has done is not only craft a work of art but allow the audience to view the crafting of the work of art brick by brick line by line side by side for anybody involved in this film whether it be the filmmakers or the audience members there is an intimate oneonone feeling that transcends both time and reality and for that we are indebted to the filmmakers being masons age myself i find boyhood to be a very special film that is incredibly close to my heart as i sat in the theater watching mason head off to college i suddenly realized that that was me i too had just transitioned into adulthood and started a new chapter in my life epic in both a technical and an emotional scope boyhood defines a generation by allowing the audience to go on their own intimate journey with the characters though the film is a rough 3 hours long you feel as if it lasts the whole 12 years simply because you are reliving the period yourself boyhood is the type of movie you dont want to end because there is something so deep in the connection it made with you this i can say with no reservation boyhood is one of the most unique personal and authentic films i have ever encounteredwhen someone tells me words cannot express i typically laugh at the absurdity as a writer i conceitedly believe that there are always words for everything however i must bow to this clich

encounteredwhen shawshank begins for about the first two minutes it seems nothing more than a made-for-tv movie. however as the story progresses you find out how amazing it really is. yet how can a film that contains rape beatings and suicide make you feel so good at the end frank darabont manages to do this so well. the green mile gives you a warm feeling at the ending but not like this does. i just love the way it follows the subplot of brooks right up until he kills himself. how touching that was to see an old man let out of prison but without routine. he belonged in prison not in the outside world. you forget at times that you are watching a movie. it sucks you in and moves you. if you havent seen shawshank you have missed out on one of the finest movies ever made. but dont worry - youre not beyond redemption watch itwhen it comes to quentin tarantino op delivers and this movie is by far one of the best four in one stories or tales of violence and redemption out there true that the actors are pure talent but in connection with a mind-blowing storyline the result is easy grandiose words cannot dare to describe what feelings you may have while watching crime drama thriller and a little mystery in a tarantino movie can overcome decades of action movies the point is that im not trying to praise the director in any way i just think that its a must to express warm approval or admiration of him genius minds are a rare occasion to come in contact with gg tarantino when i went to theater expecting something similar to batman begins an average good all around action movie. what i got from the dark knight is a perfect beautiful masterpiece with very little flaws if any. heath ledger is a master at his role. he is the best villain in any movie i have ever seen. it is a shame he died because he is a very good actor. christain bale had another good performance and the rest of the cast had great showings. the plot was great and i have to say that heath ledger is a great great joker and no one can match him. heath ledger is another new edition to the cast and is a good prosecutor. batman learns more about himself fighting joker then he ever imagined.when i went into kingsmen i had no idea what to think i had not doe my research and went into the theater with moderate expectations thinking i was going to see a mediocre cheesy movie about british spies but i was so wrong kingsmen is about a ultra secretive spy agency that is trying to save the world although a very common plot this movie was made so that is was very unique despite a clich plot the longer i was watching the movie i kept on realizing how much i loved the movie it was filled with unique action an unforeseen plot and a great quirkiness that enhances the film so much along with all of these features the movie was filled with a class a cast it was a very well neededwellrounded moviewhen i went into kingsmen i had no idea what to think i had not doe my research and

and tim robbins and bob gunton. very realistic and definitely one of my absolute favourites of all time. at the end it made me cry and thought about life. every time i watch it the film brings a tear to my eye. fantastic film and worth watchingits really realistic film and another one of stephen kings great stories a story of hope and many people who have watched will say the same thing - if you havent seen this film already then watch it it is brilliant just brilliant be prepared to be moved its such a breathtaking journey for the whole two hours. a truly lovely magical film my favourite of all time fantasticwhen i watched the nolans batman begins i was amazed by the film. i wasnt a kids movie it was haunting adventure of the dark defender and how he was formed. the intensity and the plot of the film were out of this world. batman begins was my favorite movie but then dark knight came along. the plot and the acting were superb and there were surprises till the end of the movie. the way nolan portrayed the joker was breathtaking. his laugh his attire and his acting was amazing. the actor who played joker heath ledger did an amazing job and will be remembered for this amazing role. may his soul rest in peace. nolan was also able to put the origins of two-face in the movie. harvey dent and later two face was very powerful. all he wanted was justice and to bring down every single criminal in gotham but one criminal joker changed him and made him into the villain of batman. joker indirectly killed the love of his life rachel dawes maggie gyllenhaal and made him go out for revenge and made him a killer. the two lives of bruce wayne were shown beautifully. his rich playboy life and his life as batman. dark knight was an amazing film and is a must watch.when i watched shawshank redemption at firsti had been in the high school and this film left a good impression with me i say that i learned how to follow your passions and hopes how to struggle to be free. and  dont never forgethope is good something and good somethings never die  this sentence which passes in the film i always believe it every part of mine. because a person lives with his or her hopes and passions so if it is seized from peoplethat people lose their aims in the life. and what the best properties of this film it shows that hopes and passions are indispensable for people...in addition to my review about shawshank redemption whenever i watch this film i learn that it puts in new things my life. it is so important for every watcher shawshank redemption should be watched and i advise it to you :when i walked out of the movie i was asked what i liked about it. everything i answered. everything was nearly perfect about this movie: the action scenes were intensewhen i saw this movie first time i just said how good can be because whenever i watch a series first film that i know if the first film would be great i know that the second one would be terrible but this series its just been increasingly much better than the first one. christian bale returns as bruce wayne the billionaire playboy who moonlights as batman. having eased more comfortably into a lifestyle of excess wayne lurks on the fringes of his familys corporation as ceo lucius fox morgan freeman runs the boardroom. but when an ambitious district attorney named harvey dent aaron eckhart comes forward to challenge gotham citys villainy through proper legal channels the man also known as batman sees an opportunity to replace his vigilante persona with a figure of virtue who will truly inspire the best in the citizenry.when i saw that the shawshank redemption was #1 on the top 250 movies of all time i thought yea i could understand that. i dont necessarily agree that its absolutely the best but it is so good that it makes sense that a forum of popular consensus for film rankings would rank it at the top. it is the story of andy dufresne played by tim robbins and his time at shawshank prison. it is a perspective of what it is to be human and to have hope for the future even in the face of insurmountable adversity. its funny because i dont really think that any one particular thing stands out as spectacular. the performances are very good but nothing really noteworthy. the characters all serve the story beautifully but none of them really stand out from the others. frank darabont is great the shots are exactly what they should be. almost the entire film is shot at the prison adding to the feeling of isolation and routine. and yet we are captivated from the outset. morgan freeman could read a sears catalogue and id pay to hear it his narration breathes life into every scene that its spoken over. the real beauty of this film is its story mostly about andy and red robbins and freeman but its the way that each character contributes symbiotically to the development of the story that is the absolute mastery. stephen kings novella rita hayworth and the shawshank redemption was the short story that was used as the basis for the film and it serves as evidence that king is not just a master of horror but a true literary genius. sure he doesnt use as many fifty cent words as histories other great masters but does anyone tell as good a story king always gives his writing such distinct atmosphere and energy that you cant help but get swept away. the shawshank redemption is no different. if there is a film by which other films should be judged this is as good as it can get. powerful engaging visceral despairing a masterfully woven dialogue of what it means to be human. its one of those journeys of the human spirit that just makes you feel happy to be alive. an amazing story translated beautifully to the screen. a masterpiece 10/10.when i saw pulp fiction the first time i knew instantly that i have to see it over and over again the cast directing story and everything matched completely in a way that i love them to match tarantino made an outstanding job in this film and i was very very disappointed when the movie did not receive oscar for best film or best direction this loss made me realize for sure that the best ones are not the ones to get the so called highest recognition but anyhow pulp fiction is and probably always will be the movie that i want to see over and over again and also the one that i want to remember for the rest of my life >when i rented the movie i was doubtful whether to rent it or not. then i started watching it. from the very 1st moment i was kinda sure it wud be worthy watching this  the serious violence of american gangster movies crime movies and films noirs mixed up with the wacky violence of cartoons video games and japanese animation  and the fragmented story-telling structures of such experimental classics as citizen kane rashomon and la jetÍ©e. the oscar-winning script by tarantino and roger avary intertwines three stories featuring samuel l. jackson and john travolta in the role that single-handedly reignited his career as hit men who have philosophical interchanges on such topics as the french names for american fast food products  bruce willis as a boxer out of a 1940s b-movie  and such other stalwarts as harvey keitel tim roth christopher walken eric stoltz ving rhames and uma thurman whose dance sequence with travolta proved an instant classic. when i first watched pulp fiction i was completely controlled by its energy tarantino was able to lead the entire audience around like pepe-la-peu was lead by the scent of perfume i have since watched it countless times and realized that the details are what carry this movie the big picture the basic stories the characters the situations that bring them together is extremely interesting and alone would have been sufficient yet tarantino threw in details that you wouldnt notice were placed on purpose for example listen to the dialogue and notice how references are made in passing notice that the reason mia odd was because she snorted heroin thinking that it was coke since it was in a baggy rather than a balloon tarantino set that scene up subtley in lances bedroom almost an hour before the od many movie-watchers go over a film with a fine-toothed comb in order to find mistakes that the director or the actors made in pulp fiction tarantino raises the bar by giving us treats to find within the detailswhen i first saw this movie on video i was in 5th grade i expected to see a action film because bruce willis is in it but after the movie was over i was confused and totally lost by this movie the second time i saw it i was a junior at high school and i was totally fascinated by this movie as shown in reservoir dogs tarantinos answer first question later scenes are unique and amusing to watch also the dialogues are hilarious such as conversation about foot massages and actions are bit too violent but also great i also enjoyed john travolta and uma thurmans twist scens a lot the actings are superb john travolta samuel l jackson and uma thurman gave their best performances in their careers bruce willis was still pretencious but he was okwhen i first saw this movie i was pretty confused and i had to see it a couple more times before i understood it all many critics hated mission impossible because of this i liked that it was very complicated it added to the mystery i think the part in the cia terminal room is classic very exciting this is one of brian de palmas best he throws lots of surprises at you tom cruise and ving rhames are always good together and i liked emilio estevezs part *** 12 starswhen i first saw the shawshank redemption i was in a movie theater on a week night at around 11pm. i had gotten out of work from working the evening shift. i was tired and just wanted a little amusement. this was at a time after shawshank had been released but got little attention. i had heard some oscar buzz so my curiosity got the better of me. i half reluctantly chose to watch it. that night i was not prepared to be blown away. i didnt see a movie i was transported by a story. i was instantly transcended into realizing why films should be made to begin with. i wasnt just entertained i was emotionally moved and intellectually bamboozled in the most endearing manner. if this film remains on imdbs number one spot for a long time to come its well deserves it. to me personally the shawshank redemption is a testament as to why the 90s were an interesting decade but more than that why a film can become an experience and gain instant classic status. there are two simple rules you should follow prior to watching t s r: one if you havent seen it dont let any one who has seen it tell you anything about its plot dont listen to a word caus they might ruin it for you. two make arrangements not to be interrupted when watching the film  the two towers doesnt match the opening movie or the climax and the best film of the decade. the return of the king is mind blowing. most seeing the movie know the plot as they have read tolkeins mighty opus. but if you have missed the news christopher lees character doesnt appear. no saruman. make sense of it and sarumans death at the hands or wraps of the worm in the book. battle of pelennor fields is a masterwork. far better than the battle scenes in russel crowes robin hood which i saw this week. scott uses flesh and blood and a mass of special effects beats him off the screen created in this monster of a movie. the bearers of the ring make the miserable ascent to their final destination to dispose of it. sauron being stuck as a giant burning eye the whole time sort of limits what he can do. peter jackson solves that with a dreamlike moment of frodos final struggle. peter jackson is clearly a genius in his ability to allow actors to act and giving them space to do so. lord of the rings would have been so much lesser had he mashed the actors in special effects and monsters like george lucas does. the biggest applause is for new zealands landscape. it is the land of lord of the rings. when i first saw pulp fiction i thought it was a kinda cool movie  violent but in a cool way shocking but in a cool way i dont know how many times i have seen this film but i now see its so much more its a rich intertextual film going experience its a gangstar movie for lack of a stronger term its a black comedy its a renegade boxer story its easy rider deliverance and shaft its a film noir its a melodrama its romance and action its narrative flow is not just novel but near genious if tarantino was only allowed to be credited with one film in his amazing career this would definitely be the one when i first rented pulp fiction out of the local filmtown video store i didnt know what to think i just thought that three hours of talking who cares but when i saw the movie second timei was completely blown away bruce willis as bad as he wants to be gives everything he got while playing the role of butch he is frustrated angry scared and out of is mind at the same time well who wouldnt be if he had a mob like ving rhames tryin to catch him john travolta and samuel jackson is the most perfect on-screen duo ever seen travolta a gentleman hoodlum tries to talk sense to jackson who experienced a religious awakening during a normal payback assignment uma thurman plays her role like its in her blood she plays mia wallace a drug addict and mobs wife she kinda reminds me of courtney love it is amazing how quentin tarantino can make a conversation about european fast food restaurants sound interesting tarantino is genius i tell you genius a three-hour film full of dialogue sounds boring but this is anything but that damn i shouldnt have written this now i want to watch it againwhen guardians of the galaxy was announced many people didnt know who they wereme tooafter this thoi think everyone will know who they arethe story follows peter quill and how he mets the other guardians grootrocketgamoraand draxand their first mission togetherthe story was very good and fits great with the other marvel movies and what is comingthe humor plays very great even when theres dramathe acting was also great by everyoneeveryone fit there rolesthe villain ronan was okaynot as great as loki but he wasnt the worstevery guardian was so interestingyou feel like if they had there own solo movie it would be very interestingof course the character that stand out the most was rocketbradley cooper every joke by him was always on point and very funnyanother plus was the soundtrackevery song was just so goodit fit the story i think everyone can enjoy this movieit says its pg13 but do be careful if you bring your children because there is a lot of bad languagethere is a postcredit scence so stay for thatwhen batman begins was released in the year 2009 i watched it and wondered seeing the ending scene where the joker was revealed to be the villain in the next installment of the series that well how christopher nolan is gonna incorporate the funny playful and completely insane character of the joker in to his dark and serious version of batman.. so when i went to watch this movie i was ready to see the heath ledgers joker cracking some jokes blowing up lots of places killing tons of people going way beyond insane and of course laughing a lot.. but the joker i saw was rather just the opposite. he did blow up buildings he did kill people he did go insane and laugh but he did all of this with a motive and a touch of control and calmness to it.. its been a while since i have seen a movie where the villain shines more than the hero and in this movie heath ledgers joker completely stole the show. everything he does seems reasonable and the things that he says feels honest and true. the movie grips you throughout its 152min runtime. christopher nolan nailed it and showed how comic book characters can be taken out of their colorful world put them in a dark and serious movie and make it work.. other actors also played their part well christian bale was good as batman/bruce wayne aaron eckhart was brilliant as harvey dent gary oldman maggie gyllenhaal michael caine and morgan freeman played their roles beautifully. this movie is one of my favourite movies of all time for those of you who havent watched it yet i recommend you watch it as soon as possible because this kind of gems come rarely..when a film series or trilogy receives as impeccable a treatment a j.r.r. tolkiens lord of the rings its nearly impossible for its grand finale to falter. such is the case of the return of the king an absolutely colossal conclusion to peter jacksons epic vision. considering a majority of return of the king is payoff for being patient in the previous two chapters the film is the most fun of the three and the biggest crowd pleaser. if you loved the previous films you cant not love this one more. its not necessarily that the film is better. rather its so tonally and structurally consistent with the other films that by virtue of being the end it stands out as an incredible experience hence its winning of the oscar for best picture. after the battle of helms deep and the defeat of isengard the armies of mordor move on gondor and the city of minas tirith. with king theoden bernard hill of rohan wary of giving all his muscle to the men of gondor gandalf ian mckellen and pippin billy boyd ride there to convince the steward of gondor denethor john noble the mourning father of boromir to extend his hand to rohan and in effect to aragorn viggo mortensen heir to the throne and rightful king of gondor a title the ranger struggles with. the war of the ring is something to behold even though its interrupted by frodo elijah wood and sams sean astin quest to cast the ring back into the fires of mt. doom. rather than having the forces of sauron and the armies of gondor and rohan clash in a tense battle in which the victor remains unclear the story sets the battle up to have two extreme sides namely that we spend a majority of the battle scenes watching minas tirith get torn to pieces wondering how good can possibly triumph. on the other end we know that gollum andy serkis has plans to betray frodo and sam in order to repossess his one and only precious. the debate between the two hobbits on whether gollum can be trusted reaches its zenith in a heartbreaking way seeing as we are aware of gollums intentions and by this point with the ring reaching mordor it calls out for its master and consequently has a horrible effect on frodo. the story pushes certain failure to the brink in both the war of the ring and in frodo and sams quest to destroy the ring and its easy enough to buy every ounce of it despite knowing it cant possibly end in a horrible way. thats testament to the power of the storytelling going on here. how return of the king really one ups the two towers is that it doesnt feel as though its bouncing around nearly as much between the different story lines even though it is. the momentum of the impending battle and frodo and sam inching closer and closer to mt. doom keep things on edge and driving forward at all times. no scene feels obligatory or like its stalling and even some creative scene juxtaposition such as pippin singing to denethor as faramir charges into battle only makes the script appear even stronger. from an action and visual spectacle standpoint return of the king completely outdoes the previous chapters. a battle sequence in which legolas orlando bloom takes down an entire oliphant on his own sums up the quality of the film in the most basic entertainment sense. even with all the doom and gloom theres still plenty of humor in this one as well. the resolution of the many subplots also helps to improve the overall quality of two towers in the context of the trilogy just by providing payoff to all the story lines that film built yet to which it gave no resolution. everything that eowyn miranda otto does in two towers feel for naught by the end of that film but she gets her shining moment in return of the king that brings her character full circle. return of the king works well on its own but it also proves that the lord of the rings was meant to be watched together as a trilogy as lots of small details in the first two films pay bigger dividends in the finale. jackson certainly proved why the entire trilogy needed to be filmed together as a complete entitywhats fantastic about tarantino is his ability to make films that are entertaining throughout he does this in part by having his characters discuss off subject things which really helps the characters and doesnt hinder performance in any way hes absolutely fantastic at writing dialogue and it really adds to it pulp fiction feels vibrant pulp fiction feels alive and far from interminable it knows exactly what direction it going in it feels fresh and innovative due to the clever story structure that doesnt feel convoluted at all the story structure to me actually aids the ending and the film as a whole incredibly clever stuff from tarantino over time tarantino films have become more and more bloated but this and reservoir dogs were perfectly restrained films to be both wild and restrained at the same time to me is an impressive feat performance wise i think everyone here is on top form its an interesting cast and a brave cast but it absolutely fits i enjoyed willis more than usual as he seems more free and relaxed travolta is handled very well which is something that i would have thought is very hard to do his characters need to be tongue in cheek and thats certainly the case here for me this is a film that can only really be done once doing away with narrative structure in this way gives it a completely unique feel whilst still being compelling i think few could pull this off in fact i doubt even tarantino could pull it off again for bravery creative spark unique tone awesome writing and pure entertainment value i cant not give this a ten ten out of tenwhat you get when you mix a james bond movie like 007 and matthew vaughns 2010 hit kickass? you get kingsman the secret service a wildly funny and pleasing action comedy starring colin firth and samuel l jackson this film is packed with everything a great action comedy needs amazing casting gut busting humor and a fantastic script kingsman is easily one of the best funniest comedies i have seen in recent years and contains some of the most clever oneliners especially from samuel l jackson it had my friends and i laughing almost constantly throughout the duration of the film taron egerton plays eggsy a young man in his late teens or early twenties who is called by harry galahad colin firth to join a top secret organization known as kingsman a corporation of spies there he must go through a grueling training to take down an evil villain richmond valentine who is bent taking over the world by using mind control chips on everyone around the world sound familiar? the funniest part about this how the chips causes people to engage into fist fights and kill each other which is shown in various scenes this movie is filled with insanely hilarious scenes such as colin firth beating the crap out of thugs with an umbrella and eggsy blowing up everyones heads into cartoonish explosions as well as the comedic chemistry from colin firth samuel l jackson and taron egerton if you are a big fan of kickass and kickass 2 this is a movie not worth missingwhat to say this trilogy sets up a totally new standard of filming and if anyone wants to compete with this piece of art surely have a big job to do. cant tell you how much i enjoy watching these movies. totally a new world visually very impressive acting at very high level to action keeps you entertained during the whole movie and watching these three movies makes you sad because they least only 11 hours . cant have enough of these movies. its been 11 years since i watched for the first time and i still feel hungry for them. i think that many years will pass until someone will make a better movie than lotr and in my opinion for 50 years this trilogy will keep very high place on imdb list because these movies are timeless.what to say about the shawshank redemption i shouldnt really have to say anything because when most people hear about it they already have a pretty good idea of how incredible it is. this movie is freakin immaculate. darabont and co. have created not only the most inspiring film in ages but one of the most emotionally significant films to date. the movie teaches things to us that we need to know - messages on hope perseverance and friendship - and it does it with marvelous eloquency. all in all the shawshank redemption remains one of the most spectacular films i have ever seen - a master piece of art. perfect.  the characters the dialogue the music the colors the crazy plot. i wish tarantinos follow-up to pulp fiction had also been an ensemble piece but my guess is that he wanted to avoid being pegged as a certain kind of storyteller. in my book hes only one kind of storyteller: a great one. outside of short cuts this is the best film ive ever seen. 10 stars. what pulp fiction does is not give you the normal rinky-dink point-a to point-b generic movie the film isnt about plot progression what tarantino does in essence is create an entire world this is a vast interwoven interacting multi-varied facet of a criminal underworld in which we quickly find interest and empathy in vivid solid characters what this film conveys is a kind of charisma not only from each of these character but from the synergy they create as a whole that can make you feel like you have really stepped into their world into another life and accept this morally ambiguous modern-day epic truly there has not been a more enriched and wholly enthralling film to have been released in the last decade if not longer and lastly on a personal level while i do not believe that this is the ultimate masterpiece of film history it is personally my favorite film and was the defining film that has lead me towards a career in the film industry so obviously it must have something going for itwhat is there to say about this movie except it is a triumph in film making. first of all anything narrated by morgan freeman you know is going to be a great movie. a story of a life behind bars with no end this ordinary man turns shawshank prison up side down. i think the fact that this movie is so simple is also the reason it is so great. there is no complicated cinematic techniques or special effects just men talking to each other. tim robbins shows us that the good guys can win even when their livelihood has been taken away. its the kind of movie that just makes you smile on the inside and lets you appreciate the simple things even if just for that day. the shawshank redemption is definitely a movie everyone should see only if just to brighten your day. but i think in the future it will prove to be an important mark in cinematic history.what in the gods name was that my lord what a movie excellent brilliant nope this movie is more than that the characters the plot all was part of the plan what can i say about this kind of movie bale eckhart ledger ripcaine freeman everybody every scene everything in this film is just .... i cant say a word which mean over the top and more thanks mr chris nolan this what all the dark knight fans taking about this is the world of batman realistic apocalyptic im from colombia so que h. de p. pelicula tan buena. please wb do it again mr nolan deserves a high profit for his work also mr bale and cowhat i cant get is why i cant shout int the reviews :p okay on a more serious note the dark knight is one of the best superhero movie ever made if not the best movie christopher nolan has produced yet another near perfection movie the plot the story the lines the action everything was near perfect but the real reason of it reach this and im not afraid to say this is heath ledger heaths performance as the joker is what makes this movie perfect christian bale was awesome as well. but let me assure you it is the joker that keeps you at the edge of your seat a near perfect movie and an inspiring performance as the joker by heath must watchwhat i can say is this is a really great movie. it tells use there exists brightness in the darkness and never gives up hope. you will succeed in the end. and also be ready at any time. maybe it is because of language problem i dont grasp it very well in the beginning. but step by step i understand it. and in the end i understand it and especially the result is out of my expectation that doesnt happened in the movies i have ever seen in the past. and also the performance skill is another thing i like it. they are good actors. and this is the movies that seldom take man-women sensation as topic but still give people good feelings. great movie encourage you while entertaining you  also for the perfect story. peter jackson has showed everybody that he can do the lord of the rings from book to movie. i will also give some credits to the best writer ever: jrr tolkien. he was in the beginning a ordinary teacher until he write a little sentence: once upon a time there was a hobbit who lived in the shire. this little hobbit was bilbo bagger. but back to the movie this is the best movie ever been made. viggo mortensen is fantastic as the role aragorn. but dont he have more beard in the end of the film than in the beginning. but the actor that i think is the greatest in the lord of the rings company is sean astin alias samwise gamgi. he make his performance so fantastic. the emotions is really coming forward here. i love the scene when sam takes frodo on his back to carry him the last steps in to the fires of mount doom: i cant carry it for you the ring... but i can carry you so finally i just want to say: this is the greatest movie in the modern history... what has been said that hasnt been said before the story the characters the music the special effects the visual effects the cinematography the source material the endings the plot in a nutshell: frodo and sam are on mordors footsteps with the doubtful intentions of gollum leading them. meanwhile sauron is angry at the heir of isildur and sets to attack gondor. the greatest battle scene ever conceived and made takes place. but its not the end. the good guys win the battle but the war is still on. frodo has been betrayed by gollum and left to die with shelob. he survives but unconscious and is taken right into mordor by patrolling orcs. there after being rescued by sam they set off to mount doom to destroy the ring. but in order to distract saurons eye from witnessing all of this aragorn and company set a fight in front of the the imposing black gate. theyre more than positive that they will lose. but frodo fights and falls repeatedly until he gets right above the fire. when hes about to turn away as the ring always manage to do gollum appears and fights frodo for it. thankfully the once hobbit falls with the ring in hand and both are melted in the lava. mordor sauron and the orcs are destroyed. the good guys win. aragorn is crowned but it is he who bows to the hobbits for their services were even greater then what anyone could have ever done. this is where you can turn off the tv stop the dvd or change the channel. the rest is just frodo saying goodbye. my opinion i loved the movie never in the history of film-making there will be a fantasy movie as original engaging universal and pure fun as the lord of the rings. im not sure if peter jackson had in his mind that the movie would be the ultimate epic that it has become. this chapter is the best in the three. yes the many endings drag but at least when i saw it in the theater i didnt want it to end seriously. the  here goes all out. while it has the same dramatic touch from the previous it bigger in scope even the simplistic boy chant when gollum contemplates the ring for the last time is epic and ecstatic. i personally would have ended the movie with the final shot on minas tirith and a pan on the map of middle earth. a beautiful perfect scene. the rosie cotton loose end had to be tied up i think because people wouldnt think sam and frodo had more than friendship which due to the sociological contamination of the media is rather ambiguous. but even as it has some drawbacks these arent enough to take away any stars from this pictures rating. it has made history and it has become the star wars for a new generation not even the prequels could imitate the impact this new trilogy had. best fantasy movie ever this is not a naive statement that will pass on whenever another fantasy movie is made. its for real. you can just feel astonished. how can a movie be that great  audio/sound: 10/10 return of the king deserves much praise for its auditory work making the viewer really enjoy this movie. audio/music is a very important part of a movie and this movie certainly reaches sky-high on that level. every bit of music and sound mixing fits extremely well with the scenes in which they have been placed. editing: 10/10 with a very few exceptions the editing done for rotk is close to flawless. it does not get confusing to watch neither is it boring or slowed down at any time. the pace is done with the mind of a perfectionist. you are kept on your toes throughout the movie. visual effects: 10/10 although not completely perfect there is not any moment of bad effects which would have made many disappointed. they are in fact extremely well done and deserve 10/10. screenplay: 10/10 the screenplay writers deserves extremely much praise for what has been achieved. when watching the movie everything seemed to fit perfectly well. screenplay is a very important part of any movie and in comparison to rotk no movie i have ever watched comes close to it. directing: 10/10 peter jackson is a perfectionist and he boldly takes on one of the hardest directing jobs possible and he succeeds the lotr-trilogy is beyond doubt the best that has ever been made and rotk is its crowning masterpiece. acting performances: 10/10 there is no best acting ensemble but there is best performances by an acting ensemble and in rotk everyone does a truly amazing job. there is a harmony in the ensemble and all are clearly doing the best that they can. every actor glows in the scenes which they are a part of and makes the movie ever so much more enjoyable. 10/10 art design: 10/10 every detail from minor to major is done to perfection. we really get a feel that this is middle-earth which is not by any means an easy job. in this movie this remains one of the most important aspects and is done beautifully. costume designs: 10/10 as with the art design this is also done to perfection. we really see middle-earth and with very much thanks to the clothing and costumes. make-up/hair: 10/10 this too plays an important role and is of course extremely well done. from the beautiful elf to the ugly orc all is congruent and we believe what we see to be middle-earth. summary: what we have here is a movie that is done with careful perfection and a loving heart and with the utmost respect for the novel by j.r.r. tolkien. the achievements of every part of the movie is undeniably close to perfection and what we are left with is a stunning experience that will leave marks on anyone seeing it. it is no exaggeration to call this movie the greatest of all time and the evidence is there for all of us to see. you dont have to enjoy the story to see that what is created is a masterpiece of movie-making. this is the only movie i have seen that deserves a 10/10 overall and i am in fact surprised that it is not above all others at the top-list of imdb. but on top of the list or not this is the best work ever done in the motion picture market and has made movie-making into an art what do you get if you take all the garbage out of the low budget movies and glue it all together yep you guessed it - pulp fiction the ultimate movie of my generation. one could call it the bible for film freaks. if you didnt see it yet read no more just go and buy it or rent it whatever. and if you dont like it go see it again and again if necessary.what can i say...the only film to make a grown man cry no film comes close to this in any way or formit draws you in from the start-keeps you there and if your like me..turns you to tears at the very last scene.enjoy it because no film will ever be made like this again.  and though i like reservoir dogs more pulp fiction is not too far away of being as great as that. and i must say too that pulp fiction should have won the oscar that year instead of forrest gump. what can i say.. this was the best batman movie ever.. what performances the details in this movie were superb. coming from an audio background myself the detail in the sounds design and post-production was incredible. i can only imagine the amount of tracks necessary to create the effects and foley. my hats off to all the cgi folks. i really look forward to great graphics and they did just that. for those that have been watching batman movies for decades the villain played by mr. ledger will make you tremble with fear. the way he truly developed and embraced this character is unreal.. he became the joker. i always having a saying.. you are good as your last work its a shame it was his last. this movie is one to buy and keep as a collectible. go get itwhat can i say this is perfect see it twice or more every time you watch it you will discover new fancy details in the picture or hear a new line that somehow wasnt there the first time thats all there is to be said about that enjoy the perfect movie  in another story he is with his partner jules winnfield samuel l jackson trying to transmit a message to a group of guys who owns money to marcellus wallace  in another story he only makes an appearance in which is actually the story of butch coolidge bruce willis a fighter who works marcellus wallace which after a fight which was supposed to lose he tries to flee the country with his french girlfriend fabienne maria de medeiros many other characters form the movie mixing in stories each one with a different theme but all have something alike long dialogs the film features unprecedented writing addresses several topics some do not have anything to do with the stories and the situations of the characters but the way they are written in a way so simple and interesting is really from a true master on writing screenplays that is quentin tarantino despite having had help from roger avary on the screenplay this time but all the ideas are still from tarantinos mind keeping his good dark-humor and his bloody fun violence the film with so many stories tarantino mixes the different chapters leaving them out of order not to leave more confused but to leave the film more entertaining and extremely interesting with the insane dialogs between characters a legendary film excellent performances perfect writing with interesting stories covering various topics and all very entertaining undoubtedly the best tarantino film a classic and a legendary masterpiecewhat can i say quentin tarantino changed something in movies and this and resoirvor dogs was the ones that put him on the map now i must say this is a harsh movie it shows stuff thats rarely shown in films it is also realistic and heck even funny at times this is a good definition of a good film its well made its well written and its provocative its not the kind of film you turn on on a saturday night for some fun but if you like film you must watch this but i warn you its r rated for a reason i guess the expression can you handle the real world really makes sense in this movie so if your a film buff and you havent seen this what are you waiting for i give this film a 10/10what can i say its shaw shank. i dont refer the film as the shaw shank redemption i call it shaw shank as everyone knows what im on about when i say its my favourite and i only seen it in april 2012. the story is well known as andy dufrense is wrongly accused of a double murder and sentenced to shaw shank prison where he meets red played by the awesome morgan freeman. over time in the movie he adapts to life in prison and escapes and becomes a free man. how did a movie this so simple become beloved by so many. how i dont know how and i dont care but this film is basically a beginner for any filmmaker and already became a success years later. although it did not great at the box office yet critics praised it well years later people discovered it on vhs. i wished i seen this film earlier as a teenager as it would have struck to me even more through a time i felt depressed and sad. a discovered this movie in the local library and rented it as i heard of the film being very good and after seeing it it is more than just good. i may be over-exaggerating this brilliance of the film but it unlike many other films except the lion king of the return of the king hit me right in the soft spot. i didnt cry at the end i smiled at the end. what a film. the good of the film the acting from freeman. although he lost to hanks in forrest gump for best actor i donwhat can i say about this movie that hasnt already been said it proves that good acting writing editing and a kick-ass soundtrack are the perfect ingredients to make a superb and refreshing film its just one of those films you can watch over and over and never get bored with it from the memorable dialogue to the unique and impressionable characters  this movie has it all if you love a movie that energizes all of your senses then check this one out this truly is american film making at its finest what can i say about this movie i think anyone who watch the movie can say the same cause theres only one word to define this movie: perfection. maybe everybody wont think that but remember: perfection is different for each one of us...what can i add to all the other reviews here just my own feelings about this. i now realise i watched the film in one of the hardest times emotionally i can remember in my life. thoughts chasing themselves around in my head heartbroken paranoid and not well physically. total mess. my dear female friend who got me through it all told me this was a film to watch. i initially resisted thinking it was going to be lightweight pc fare. i dont know why i thought that. theres a lacklustre opening sequence -i think. then you get to see what kind of performance morgan freeman is going to turn out this time and you start to be interested. then this extraordinary scene flying over the prison and i think by then youre hooked. this scene is deeply moving not least because of the music. its difficult to see how thomas newmans music for this film could possibly be bettered - perfectly listenable to in its own right but when you do youre reminded of the boys on the roof in the sun enjoying their first beer for so long. theyve been touched by andys kindness. sometimes a kindness is thrown back in ones face but other times a gesture of gratitude is given back - like haywood getting up and offering andy one of his beers - and a powerful connection is made. the film is full of great hardships and unbearable sadness - surely scars that can never completely heal or be forgotten. but it is also full of joy and fun and hope. to capture all the above in a film is a triumph. i started watching the film fairly closed to feeling but as i watched the end i could not contain my tears unusually. so a moment when a film came along at the right time for me and no doubt for many otherswhat a narration..one of my all time favorites. shawshank redemption is a very moving story about hope and the power of friendship. the cast is first rate with everyone giving a great performance. tim robbins and morgan freeman carry the movie but bob gunton and clancy brown are perfect as the warden norton and prison guard captain hadley respectively. and james whitmores portrayal of an elderly inmate brooks is moving. the screenplay gives almost every actor at least one or more memorable lines through out the film. as well as a very surprising twist near the end that almost knocked me out of my chair.what a movie what an end to a simply superb trilogy take a bow peter jackson. the return of the king is all what you expect in a movie brilliant story brilliant acting brilliant scenic locations brilliant war sequences and a brilliant ending. it is a visual treat even for the blind. the story starts or rather continues with frodo sam and sjmeagol continuing on their journey towards and into mordor for the ultimate purpose of destroying saurons one ring while aragorn and company fight it out to protect minas tirith along with the help of rohan. the sheer magnitude of some scenes takes you by surprise such is the scale of this project and jackson executes it to perfection. the landscapes are gigantic the scenes are breath-taking especially the lighting of the beacons. inspiring to say the least the performance of viggo mortensen as aragorn is perfect. when he says for frodo and my friends you bow to no one it sounds so classy simple and yet so sublime. and what follows is a speechless moment of vigor determination and hope and trust. sean astin as samwise gamgee steals the show towards the end. his performance was nothing short of authentic and complete. his loyalty and friendship towards frodo is depicted beautifully with lovely dialogs and sequences. special appreciation also to the creation of sjmeagol the creature who seeks the ring. his character has been aptly shown on the screen and one can only admire the lengths of effort put in. all in all the return of the king is a success. it is much more than just a movie. it has been a revolution of visual cinema in a way that has inspired many fantasy books and movies from the era of j.r.r. tolkein. the film is complete with the battle at minas tirith one of the best movie scenes ever to be made. it is long a joy to watch and a bigger enjoyment to watch again. the background  is splendid especially towards the end when frodo nearly reaches the foothills of mount doom and proceeds towards the depths along with sam. this movie will move many hearts and win even more. very few movies of this caliber come and go every year let alone a decade and to miss this saga would be a fools idea. without any hesitation a supreme 10 / 10.what a movie i have never seen a movie like this one. i have never been so confused or amused like this before. this movie has everything. so many great moments. i enjoyed this movie the first time i saw it and every time i watch it.what a great live action version of the classic fairytale this was a great reminder of the good old innocent days back then when people were not so cynic and faced things with open heart a great retelling full of strong emotions and a great message that if u are kind and u believe u can win the battle of life on the plus side the movie also had a great soudtrack so get the dvd when its out plus the cd soundtrack lily james was the second best cinderella candidate after kimberly matula and since kimberly was not given the role then lily was the next perfect choice all in all a great fairytale for the new generation and for the adults to remember their past innocent childhood days dont miss this movieit will make yourelive the old dayswhat a great experience. this movie capped off a 3-year journey for me - one that included my first time reading the books including the hobbit and the silmarillion and several viewings of the movies. each movie holds a special place in my heart but i think that this last one is the most satisfying. ill forever remember the beacons being lit and pippens sorrow-filled song. probably the most poignant moment though is gollums look as he gets to hold the ring one last time... and then the eagles coming... as a whole i feel ive accomplished something coming out of this experience. id like to thank the movie-makers for this experience... for it truly has been fulfilling and life changing.what a good movie do not watch this movies trailer do not research and read anything about it just watch it

outstanding performances. this is probably my all time favorite film and to anyone who hasnt seen it theres only one thing i can say: please do you wont be disappointed.weve been subjected to enormous amounts of hype and marketing for the dark knight. weve seen joker scavenger hunts and one of the largest viral campaigns in advertising history and it culminates with the actual release of the movie. everything thats been said is pretty much spot on. this is the first time i can remember where a summer blockbuster film far surpasses the hype. for as much action as there is in this movie its the acting that makes it a great piece of work. between all the punches explosions and stunt-work is some great dialog work. all the actors have their moments. bales batman is the definitive batman because we see everything in this character finally on film. martial arts skills cunning great tactical thinking forensic application technological genius to advance or improve luscious foxs inventions/technological breakthroughs intimidating personality and even a little swashbuckling. as for heath yes he gets credit for his performance as the joker. but you have to also recognize jonathan and chris nolan for the writing and treatment of the character. its not just the fact that ledger makes the joker so menacing but the nolans have given the character this great manifesto that drives its actions. the jokers stance on chaos order anarchy the morality of the average modern human being make the character so interesting psychologically. the nolans drafted a complex character and only a perfect performance couldve pulled something like this off. thats how difficult of a role this was and thats why ledgers performance is so great. this isnt an action movie. its a film that explores literary themes of the hero and villain as well as order and anarchy. yes listen to the dialog because its all in there.were still pioneers weve barely begun our greatest accomplishments cannot be behind us because our destiny lies above us mankind has finally used up all of earths resources and it has become a dying planet when cooper mcconaughey and his daughter stumble upon a secret outpost that contains the remnants of nasa they are told of the seriousness of the problem facing humanity cooper is a former astronaut and is given the responsibility of traveling into space to find a habitable planet for the human race i have been writing these little reviews for almost 5 years now and for the most part i have found it easy to talk about every movie this one i cant seem to find the right words for the reason has less to do with my vocabulary and more to do with the awesomeness of the movie there are some movies that words just cannot do justice to the last one i felt that way about was the passion of the christ this is a movie you want to tell everyone about but no matter what you say its just not enough i loved gravity and this was 1000 times better overall really nothing i can say about this movie other than watch it christopher nolan is a genius i easily give this an a+well...lets just say im 12 years old...the first time i watched it i was 7 now i still watch it every single day. not many words can describe lord of the rings some of them maybe mesmerising unbeilevable...but for me it was pro bely the most effecting movie i have ever witnessed. when i watch it i always get goosebumps...always never once have i not been star struck by it. now to all of you tolkien haters out there who call lotr nerdy lets just say f*** you now honestly i recommend these movies to pretty much everyone. now i admit that there are too many endings6 to be precise but who honestly gives if you spend 5 years of your life loving this movie intensely no matter how many endings it has they will all make you cry.well what can i say. this makes batman begins seem terrible. christian bales batman/bruce wayne is on top form and better than everespecially with the scene involving the jump off the ifs in hong kong. i would hugely recommend that you watch this film. ive seen hundreds of films and in my opinion this is the best of them all. heath ledgers joker was fantastic. he brought humour and action to the whole film. i must say that ledgers joker has to be better than nicholsons 1989 portrayal however the jokes were not of the same calibre. anyway this film had it all - the action - the jokes. the storyline was great. it showed the jokers rise to power and it had plenty of action to help. especially with the party crash scene the street scene where the tumbler explodes : but there is a surprise at this point and when gotham general hospital has some structural re-modifications  gets blown up. the ending lacked a bit of fight from both batman and the joker and both should have suffered a few more cuts and bruises. anyway the whole film was brilliant and a must see for all movie lovers. absolutely brilliant film that balances -suspense- action - laughter and adventure. absolutely brilliant just like the cast and the director. what more can i saywell what can i say but freeman who is simply a great actor a man who has never struck a false note in his career both narrates this tale and anchors it with his authoritative playing. powerful poignant thought-provoking and finally irresistibly uplifting. the shawshank redemption works not only as an excellent prison drama but as a metaphor for overcoming our own private prisons.an amazing movie. easily one of the best movies made during the 90s and definitely one of the top prison movies of all-time. pretty much everything about this movie works and works extremely well i have not read stephen kings novella his first non-horror but some of the movies deficiencies such as the old-fashioned morality tale and portentous message about camaraderie and redemption--must have been in the source material.well this film in my opinion is possibly the best ever. this is the end of the lord of the rings trilogy so it is a sad experience at the end but this film is absolutely epically epic. this film leads where the two towers left off with the evil powers gaining strength for the final conclusion against all men while frodosam and gollum head to mordor. everything is ten times bigger in thee stakes and importance as this film really plays up the fact that this trilogy is based throughout a year of these characters life and failure is not an option. every character is better then they were in the last film even the lesser characters of people from rohan and gondor are acted magnificently and really live up to the expectations of this film. there isnt much more to say about this film but see it as it is the most epic master class of film ever with great cinematography action drama and action. a film for the ages.well the summary explains all its one of the only movies if not the only movie that kept me 100% exited from the first to the last minute well they saved the best for last best story book and best acting directing... i recommend it to every person its a classic that will always be remembered as one of the best and for me its the best movie observed by my eyesfinally i have seen a movie that is so much better than titanicwell the summary explains all its one of the only movies if not the only movie that kept me 100% exited from the first to the last minute well they saved the best for last best story book and best acting directing... i recommend it to every person its a classic that will always be remembered as one of the best and for me its the best movie observed by my eyeswell let me start off by saying i felt compelled to write this review to spite the numerous people who give it a 1 out of 10 because they feel it should be lower then a 9.3 and go on to write what they really think to you people i write this: you should vote it according to what you think the movie should be i.e. if you think the movie deserves an 8 out of 10 then you should vote as such i think this movie deserves a 10 out of 10 and so i have given it as such. as for the movie i cant tell you how incredible it is in my opinion it is the only movie to date i could watch again and again and not get tired of watching it the cast was spot on everything was perfect the subjugation of the prisons by captain hadley all of it was simply spot on honestly speaking i dont know how people could watch this and fail to see how truly amazing it is well deserving of its number 1 spot on imdb. also i read that people dont understand how andy pinned the pictures to his wall it could be either celotape or bluetac and as you see during the movie andy works from under the poster when digging his hole so there is no plot hole of how he put the poster back up after entering the hole because the poster never gets taken down.well in the lotr book the noble elves never had those pinpointed ears and the death of saruman was not like a deleted scene in the dvd version and then there was not the feat of legolas of killing an elephant so easily and then sam never held frodo hanging on a cliff_„_ there are many points of bitter criticism of the film and many are true. but do they ever undermine the sheer pleasure of watching and watching again this feast of the film no they will never do. the siege of minas tirith is great and tragically realistic every new time. the final battle near mordor is epic regardless how many times you saw that. the brilliant array of talents of weaving mortensen wood tyler serkis urban wenham astin or any other is never vapid or losing taste. the film has stood the test of time and any time you see the sauron fall you feel elation pride joy and great triumph. the good has won again and even with so many tragic deaths and losses and ruins it will reign for ever and ever. the final scene of the film with the parting of bilbo and frodo together with the great elves and gandalf will always make us cry and the final song will make us breathe deep and swallow tears for this is a noble sorrow and noble sorrow this film has to awake in us. many films may be made on the eternal novel of mr. tolkien but this epic will stand in our memory eternally. the road goes ever on.well if you read the title this is what all this review about this movie about a writer who creates a story to punish her husband and everybody believe it but the reality that the writer of the movie is the one who cheated everybody by taking an old story and republish it fixing all the problems and weakness of it throwing the original into trash i watch tons of movies but im not that kind who always write a review about it the creators of this movie make me wanna write a review about it and even read the book after that its a really shocking reality when both husband and wife are victims and guilty at the same time and this is what life all about but does the punishment was fair or was it too much  this is what you going to decide after you watch this great story well i guess im a little late to the party as far as writing down a review for this picture. ive seen it a couple of times but that was before i became a regular contributor to the imdb. when i first discovered this site a few years ago the godfather was in the number #1 spot and since then the films have traded places for first and second with shawshank maintaining the top spot most of the time. that puzzled me a bit until i watched it again tonight and ive come away from the picture with a new found appreciation. my favorite movies tend to be the story of underdogs in some way shape or form and my personal top ten list includes titles like on the waterfront to kill a mockingbird and one flew over the cuckoos nest. i may have to reconsider that list an infrequent exercise but one i dont mind doing every now and then as situations warrant. overall the film is darn near perfect. i know its pretty clichÍ© to state it that way but when you analyze the dialog the characters the directing and the tone of the movie the picture flows flawlessly even when it detours into side stories like brooks hatlens release and new prisoner tommys introduction late in the picture. every set-up every nuance has some importance that eventually converges to symbolize andys quest for escape and personal redemption. remember brooks feeding jake for the first time and eventually setting him free when he receives his own pardon how about andy playing mozart into the prison yard while settling back with a smile of contentment on his face. the story transcends one mans confinement for a crime he didnt commit and focuses instead on his reaction to circumstances beyond his control. paul newman showed us a different way to react to those kinds of conditions in 1967s cool hand luke but his method was self destructive. andy dufresne tim robbins never loses his ability to keep his eye on the prize even if it takes him a couple of decades to do so. but even more so you have here the story of ellis boyd redding morgan freeman a convict who sees andy as a person and over time an inspiration to himself and the rest of the prisoners who call him friend. from andy he comes to understand that even as a prisoner a man can live life on his own terms if he can keep his mind uncluttered by thoughts of desperation and hopelessness. not bad for a convict who started out believing that hope can drive a man insane. i really cant recommend this picture highly enough both for its masterful story telling and its technical execution. the actors even those portraying the most minor characters were seemingly born for their roles. they deliver a seamless performance thats virtually unmatched by most modern films in a picture that hits all the right notes with an inspiring message of discipline and perseverance.well i didnt had any high expectations when i watched this movie but damnthis is one hell of a moviethis movie is very well safe in my top 5 favorite movie of all time as far as i remember this is the only movie that i didnt want it to end even when the duration is almost 3 hours this movie maybe didnt have much action or explosion but the dialogues are enough to keep you glued seriously i think that is what hollywood movies are lacking nowadayssuch entertaining and wonderful dialogues/conversation all of the cast did a great job in this movie and i think the one that really stand out is sam jackson and i think you all know why when you watch it and i pretty much enjoy the non- linear plot style that is shown in this movie i feel pity for anyone who still havent watch this movie or anyone who considered this movie as boringi remember when its about to end i was like nooo dont end yetsuch an addicting moviea great masterpiece that will live throughout the ageswell here it is one of the most anticipated movies of the year so far. how was it it was excellent. by far the best batman film ever made and of course it will be one of the most memorable action films for a long while. everyone was waiting to see how well heath ledger performed as the joker in this film. he definitely deserves an oscar in his honor. the character was so dark and creepy that it sent chills up my back. compared to heaths other films like 10 things i hate about you and even brokeback mountain proves that this man could actually act doesnt matter what character he could do it. the films storyline has many twists and all are rewarding the story is developed constantly after each scene making you wonder whats next. excellent craft and flows well towards the conclusion. during the film on the scene with batman against the joker bike vs truck. people thought this was the ending. no it kept going which was awesome the story kept getting darker and darker i guess thats why they called it the dark knight as well as the relation to batman himself. the cast was great. with christopher nolan playing batman good performance heath ledger played extremely well maggie was annoying at times but still deserves to be praised. michael caine and morgan freeman had minor roles which satisfied the audiences. aaron eckhart starts with a minor role which slowly progresses and becomes evil which is quite surprising and entertaining to watch. great directing made the movie enjoyable they added more action this time which made the film feel powerful lighting was done well especially showing harvey/ two faces face in the many moods he displayed. great explosions made it entertaining. made you feel great that this is finally the best action to come in a long time. this movie deserves a 10/10 rating and credit on behalf of the great young actor heath ledgers life. may he r.i.p his performance made what this film is right now. i recommend this film for any action fan especially a batman fan. or if your even a heath ledger fan. go ahead right now and see this film. its greatwell folks thats how its done ever thought mi6 note thats what the british call their secret service is a club for snobbish upper class dudes who like to watch paint dry all they long? ok bond is kind of cool i hated the last two though but now we finally got a film that takes spy movies to the next level not since district 9 have i had that feeling during the watching of a film like this movie just does everything right by which i mean of course it plays exactly to my taste compared to this film every james bond movie released after licence to kill looks like a snorefest this is such a kickass balls against the wall crazy ride that i had to shake my head several times in disbelief during the screening i was invited to and i actually knew what i was in for ive seen every film by matthew vaughn but i was not prepared how far he was willing to go with this one thought kickass was pretty crazy? wait till you see this one of the key ingredients is the casting of the actors the well known stars all play against type which makes this even more unreal remember that lame dude who mainly played lame dudes in girlie movies like bridget jones? he just won an oscar for playing the stuttering king of england and as you will see in kingsman that oscar was well deserved that dude colin firth can play anything hes more badass in this than bond ever was a word to the wise though this film is not for the easily offended or the squeamish it is a comedy but a very very violent kind of comedy and the language alone will shock the mpaa out of their pants watch this if youre into films like lock stock kickass or in bruges and youll probably love it  dont bother if youre more into serious films or family friendly comedies as for me i had a bloody good timewell directed well produced love the photography and the script is amazing quentin tarantino is one of my preferred directors and the pulp fiction was the first film from tarantino that made me start looking different for this directors work the arc of this script is super well created once the story connects all the scenes and characters in an order which makes you get into the movie the photography of this movie is also amazing very well planned in a way which brings all the atmosphere of the entire movie the characters are amazing super well acted by this super list of cast about tarantinos direction there nothing that i can tell  in my opinion this guy is a genius with enough sensibility to put the audience on the right climax at the right moment one of the best movies i have ever seenwell as the other more than 2000 review say it in my opinion this is the best movie created so far. it basically just how life is: you get punched in a face time to time but you have to stand up keep your hope and give value to your fellows because in return life takes care about your reward. oh yes and if you face any evil that you can stop do it. this is the message of the film if we follow it life may be as rewarding ultimately for us as for the hero. other films that moved me like this: forrest gump the curious case of benjamin button. imdb says i have to write another line in order for them to post my review so here it is xdweary beyond words hobbit companions frodo and sam continue their journey to destroy the one ring with the sinister gollum still their guide. the film opens interestingly with gollums origin story capturing his descent into depravity and madness finding the ring in much the same manner in which he lost it. the ring has the power to affect its bearer and not for good. with the battle of helms deep over and sarumans power gone the attention focuses on the capital of gondor minas tirith. there the race of men must make a last stand before the growing might of an unseen enemy while those visible are more of a threat than ever. the return of the king in its way is as much aragorns story as it is frodoswe have all see movies comedies action and dramas. we all liked ones hated others got into some other even and felt like part of it. in shawshank redemption  the french new wave or blaxploitation the wild bunch or the brady bunch its all grist. we are in an age where the audience can choose to view a film featuring 3-dc.g.i. and special effects. the audience may also choose to find a film which has a solid story line a remarkable plot and surprises in an unpredictable series of events. but you cant have both. this is the general rule...however with the exception of the dark knight and only a few others all of these effects seem to be necessary to attain this culmination of an a+ plot direction acting and production. definitely in my top 3 list of all time favorites. thank you to everyone who was able to make this film what it is. one thing that makes this film special is its unique ability to stand alone as a solid film without ever seeing the prequel or sequel.we all remember how good batman begins was right well after seeing the much anticipated and hyped sequel begins is childs play. good evening ladies and gentlemen. were tonights entertainment... the action kicks off with a bank heist that brings back memories of michael manns excellent heat a feeling that lingered for the entire movie and more-or-less introduces us to the joker. now believe me when i say that the joker is completely mental. heath ledgers performance is brilliant. theres talk of an oscar nomination something which is very much deserved. he completely disappears into his character perfecting the best screen villain since hannibal lecter. just check out the scene with the pencil... the joker prefers the slow kill. he is tortured by his sinister smile and when you hear how he got it it will send shivers down your spine. but the thing that is truly sinister about him is hes not into crime for the money. the joker kills and stirs the pot-because he can. this city deserves a better class of criminal... and im gonna give it to them with praise for the joker out of the way its time to acknowledge the other key players in this epic crime thriller. morgan freeman manages to put a new twist on his never-ending good guy roles he was god once for christs sake maggie gyllenhaal is the perfect replacement for the bland katie holmes as batmans long time friend and love interest rachel dawes nestor carbonell of lost fame nails the gotham city mayor and the awesome michael caine is you guessed it awesome as batmans trusty butler alfred. another interesting point of this movie is we get insight into all of these characters even alfred whos often just a plot device in previous batman movies. the night is darkest just before the dawn. and i promise you the dawn is coming... following the opening heist we see everyones favourite troubled millionaire bruce wayne christian bale cinemas definitive batman in his bat-suit once again cleaning the streets of gotham before getting the news from his close friend and clean cop james gordon gary oldman reprising his rare good guy role from begins that it would be wise to work with the citys district attourney harvey dent aaron eckhart perfectly cast in their attempts to clean the streets of criminals. this begins a series of events that brings batman to the attention of the joker who then plots to kill him in order to maintain criminal status of gotham first targeting various authority figures including the mayor and dent. so what are you proposing its simple: kill the batman... to say much more about the plot would weaken the experience of the film but there is one other key point of this film and that is the dramatic rise and fall of harvey dent and his painfully emotional and physical transformation into harvey two-face... you either die a hero or you live long enough to see yourself become the villain... all in all this film is perfectly written there are action scenes a-plenty but they dont interfere with the extraordinary character development contains brilliant performances all round especially the power-house performance by heath ledger directed with confidence and gusto by christopher nolan and is darkly funny for the most part but takes itself very seriously when it comes to the drama. know your limits master wayne. batman has no limits. the verdict: the dark knight is stunning. it will be regarded as one of the best movies of the noughties if not all time. it twists the standard comic-book formula and sets the standards of every comic-book and crime-thriller movie yet to be made. in a word: perfect.watching this movie was a pleasure the acting was outrageously good. a film without special effects and action every 5 minutes just men in prison. all i can say is i would have loved this film to have been longer. the acting from morgan freeman is second to none he proves in this film why he is regarded as one of the greatest actors to grace our screens. anyone who hasnt seen this film needs too watch it straight after reading this review as it will change your opinion on a lot of other films.watching this great movie for the second time i remember some of the best times i had as a moviegoer especially as a kid. i remember watching the original star wars series with a serious amount of amazement. raiders of the lost arc gave me a great sense of adventure. and the first jaws scared the hell out of me. all these movies and others like them provided something for me to remember. in addition they were just plain fun movies. not pretentious overwrought or just plain dumb. most of todays movies are just plain nonsense. they have no heart like they used to. they are all made for the sole purpose of making a buck. although i am sure that new line cinema would love to make billions on this series and peter jackson and his people are being paid well for their efforts that does not prevent these movies from being great works of art and just plain fun. i remember reading these books as a kid and i have always loved them and wanted somebody to do a proper adaptation of them. now that the final book has been brought to the big screen we can see the entire series from a new perspective and i for one admire it more than i ever have. it would have been easy for jackson and co. after the success of fellowship to just give people a shortened version of the last two books with teasers here and there but no substance. but he has not done this. return of the king is the best example of this. in this movie jackson has made a movie that works very well with the books and finds the most essential parts of it to make a movie that works on just about every level. from the scenery in new zealand to the look of the battles i felt as if i was there to the incomparable computer effects of gollum and the equally amazing effects of shelob ever part was filmed with a care to the details that the books deserved. the dialog in this movie is also much better than in two towers. i loved this movie from the first scene of how smeagol finds the ring of power to the last frame of sam closing his door in the shire. back to what i was saying at the top. very few movies today give me a sense of wonder that i had as a kid. this series certainly does this. from the beginning to the end the movies are a stunning achievement and worthy of any awards it receives.watch it right now because of the great acting by the leads watch it right now because of the awesome plot watch it right now because of the feeling it leaves you with you feel terrible and cheated upon watch it right now because of the ending watch it right now because of the mystery that fills the air and clouds your brain while you are watching it watch it right now so that you know how crazy can girls get and yours isnt half as crazy watch it right now because i have given you enough reasons as to why you should just watch it right now warning contains adult scenes it may disturb childrenwatch 10 movies before you die and you are at right place all the characters are beautifully executed in the movie specially ving rhames has done an amazing job while bruce willis was outstanding no doubt john travolta and samuel jackson beautifully played their characters uma thurman was at her best tim roth was very good at his small character this movie is totally memorable all the characters were like alive even a small role of zed was noticeable music was amazing to listen and it even brought john travolta dancing last but not least quintin tarantino was there to witness about the beauty of the moviewas a great movie  i love the story and the actors were fantastic. there is so much to say about this movie. but look seriously look and say it is not a great movie from beginning to end. of course a good soundtrack also makes a great movie so the soundtrack also has to be mentioned. the movie picture is very good. good angles of shooting always transmitting us the space inside the prison. or rather the space that we have not. and finally check out this great movie. they repented and were left with a better perspective for life. see the movie enjoy and learn to finish just saying that it as a great movie oh wait i already said that no problem its to highlight the idea.warning: may contain spoilers im glad youre here sam here at the end of all things i found that this particular line near the conclusion of the film struck a note inside me. not only as one of my favorite lines from tolkiens work but also as a sad reminder that the trilogy has drawn to a close. no more will the rush of anticipation fill me as another december approaches heralding the arrival of another of peter jacksons masterworks. the most monumental of the three films the return of the king also evokes the strongest impact within me. it represents the culmination of years of the most careful work that brought one of the most epic stories into cinema history. ill begin with the obvious strong points of the movie. the effects are absolutely stunning. as you have read countless times previous the battle of the pelennor fields is one of the most exhilerating thrill rides and certainly one of the grandest film battles. my mouth was agape even the third time viewing the rohirrim stare in horror amidst the low rumble of the charge of the gargantuan mamukil during the winged fell beasts diving into the white city of minas tirith and the arrival of the army of the dead. in subtler aspects cgi has been used masterfully to craft a thoroughly convincing and memorable performance of a key character. the marriage of andy serkis acting and the impecable craft of weta animators created a gollum worthy of remembrance. the settings are dazzling particularly the psychedelic green glow of the foreboding minas morgul minas tirith itself and the atmospheric horror of shelobs lair. mordor is the true hell of middle earth as the strongholds of men are the light. the acting though starkly shakespearean at times is particularly effective. the relationship between frodo and sam is brought to the forefront powerfully conveying that the most important thing driving these characters through the most evil of places is their friendship. miranda otto is given a chance to shine as eowyn the caged warrior who finally gets an opportunity to fight for those she cares for. her confrontation with the witch king promulgated by the line i will kill you if you touch him never ceased to send a shiver down my spine. though wooden at times the acting successfully moves the gears of the film. without the burden of having to establish many characters and settings as the first two films did the return of the king allows development of many characters who were initially marginalized. billy boyd is particularly effective this time around as pippin. howard shores musical  is once again stirring as ever molding a grandness of scale with the closeness and conflict of relationships. the sound design is equally awe inspiring: the nazgul shrieks and grinding stone of a collapsing city never fail to elicit a response. yes there are shortcomings. many very interesting scenes from the book didnt make the final theatrical cut. the confrontation with saruman and the scouring of the shire are two notable examples. however although i have been a tolkien enthusiast since i first read the books when i was 8 or 9 years old i do not share the cynicism of many reviewers. apart from the obvious reason that the films run-time already exceeds 3 hours there is a simple question of interpretation. certain sacrifices needed to be made to craft a feasible film for the movie going public. furthermore this is merely a certain group of peoples vision of the books. we all have different images of middle earth in our minds. the fact that a scene is left out of a movie does not necessarily make it a poor or insufficient telling of a story. i find it interesting for example that hardly any reviewers of star wars criticized the movie for having not contained scenes from lucas original book. it positively surprised me that so many people have read and enjoyed these fabulous books to offer such valid comments out of their love for the trilogy. im sure that the dvd extended edition will please the palate of anyone who was disappointed with the removal of certain scenes. in conclusion this film is a gorgeous reminder that cgi can enhance a movie-going experience without sacrificing the human element of film. i am wholly satisfied with peter jacksons vision and thank all who worked on this film for bringing such an intricate interpretation of three of my favorite novels to the screen.warning spoiler alert which actually isnt a spoiler but i am just doing this so i wont get black listed now to start off what i love about this movie is that it skewers conventional thinking in almost every aspect of the film and does not just skewer it but it unleashes an entire swath of that could be possible type stuff into the films very amazing plot warning warning not so much a spoiler alert ahead while most people usually find it offensive to kill a head of state i find it refreshing to see directors who arent afraid to go there sort of speak but trust me it goes there pretty well wink wink the movie itself is filled with an elaborate but easy to follow storyline with uncanny plot twists and unexpected you kinda understand but kinda hate him bad guys kinsmen will remain in my heart one of the best and most unapologetic spy films i have ever seen just a heads up if you are in any ways biased towards politics of conservative liberal progressive green republican or any kind of ends justify the means marxist kinda politics this movie isnt for you so my word of advice is to pretend for about 2 hours that your not associated with any politics what so ever and enjoy the filmwalking more walking gandalfs back b****es suck on dat orc pee pee some more walking a battle i can smell the

decided to rob the restaurant theyre currently eating at but the restaurant doesnt turn out to be as easy as the other places theyve robbed i cant say anything about this film that no one hasnt said before but the film is phenomenal its groundbreaking and its one of the coolest films ever to be released in the nineties but why is it its because its flawless seamless and no matter how many times you see the movie and i guarantee you will see it more than five times it never gets boring and there is always something new and unseen to catch your attention tarantino has crafted a timeless movie and it will be remembered in years and years and years to come as one of cinemas greatest masterpieces alongside citizen kane casablanca and the godfather the cast are impeccable and this film resurrected two flagging careers in willis and travolta especially travolta whose every film for the next three years would be box office gold and its down to this plus dont forget not many people had heard of samuel l jackson before this and after this hes been in nearly every film ever made since and you watch them because you are waiting for that jules winfield magic every scene is wonderful every set piece is perfect and the script is sparkling its pure gold the weak link in the film tarantinos cameo but hey this is his invention so ill let him off one of the last great films ever madevery mild spoilers first off im a huge fan of batman comics cartoons movies etc. and i am delighted with this movie. it has made batman a popular superhero for everyone and is an intense thrilling action packed spectacle. the way two-face comes into play is done very well. heath ledgers joker is fantastic and acting all round is brilliant. there is a lot of excitement and batman is truly a dark knight. the action is very well done and a lot of the time it is different from straight up fighting i cant believe how well it has been done comparing it to previous installments. go watch this movie now. im sure you will love it batman has become cool to a massive audience with this one movie. brilliantvery good moviehave a lot of special effecta lot o magic my favorite.very

well can show the any emotions how stress and pressure its is best action scene lastly great comeback from batmanbruce wayne .nice drama scene ending is a little bit shock but is change to good .i would like to thank you chistopher nolan to help batman series from death in batman and robin that is very bad but you make batman revive again with 3 movies and its wonderful and amazing make me like its very much im very sad because this is last episode of batman that you will do in this series i want to see more batman movie that you direct it . you create a plot of the stories very well in this 3 movies .the enemy of batman like scarecrow joker and bane can fight batman very close and close to win batman but hero is hero for surelyvery good acting exceptionally interesting storyline creating his own ambiance and keeping your attention till the very least scene. john travolta shows hes a great actor and bruce willis always gets the best out a character you have to watch the movie at least two times to get a good view on the whole storyline.very few movies that made me cry ... and the shawshank redemption is certainly one of them. i remember when i first went to see this movie in my freshman year in college. the movie made me appreciate freedom and true friendship. very powerful picture indeed and each actor deserved an oscar for their great performance. it is sad that the movie did not get the true scale of recognition it deserved but being on the imdb top 250 movies of all time based on peoples votes is a great way to show the well earned appreciation. if you did not watch this movie yet then you missed a lotusually i dont want to see a movie more than once in a theater let alone a movie this long. but i just want to see it again as well i cant wait for the extended version to come out on dvd. however i know that it will be a while with how good and popular it is.unlike previous letdowns this year return of the king was excellent. a perfect 10. coming in at 3 and a half hours the movie is really long...but until the last 20 minutes you really dont know. the plot acting effects and story keep people glued to their seat the entire time. sean astin deserve atleast a nod if the statue as best supporting actor oscar. elijah wood could recieve a nod for best actor. this movie will definately win best effects best musical  and could win best movie this year at the oscars. it was that good. you should go see it right now. stop staring at the computer screen and go. this movie is that good.undoubtedly one of the greatest movies i have ever seen. the outstanding performances by tim robbins and morgan freeman left me with feelings so profound of being in that prison with them. be warned that the first half of the film is visually and psychologically confronting. the film deals with fundamental themes of friendship and hope whilst delivering some very powerful social commentary. i am left questioning the state of our justice system. we lock away these threats to society alienate them and subject them to the most hostile and unnatural of environments. then when they have served their life terms we throw them back into society with the expectation for them to live normally and abide by values never once upheld or taught in their filthy prison cells. the shawshank redemption tells a very powerful story. a story that made me laugh and cry. it ignited just about every human emotion i could possibly experience in just over a two hour period of time. a truly amazing film 10 out of 10 from meun predictable amazing film that is the only word to express this whole movie it is almost impossible to predict every scene that is shown for example when trabolta not sure with his names spelling carries uma who was dying and goes to the guy who sold the drug multitude of people would think that uma would die and trabolta falls in peril with the boss but guess what they success saving uma and did uma told the boss whole this nope she kept her mouth shut did this scene affect the story not at all everything is solved and actually this scene is not the final scene of the movie it was just the part of beginning but the most fascinating part is that in this movie the big story are pretty predictable but the little small storys elements are totally unpredictable how is this possible cause it is tarantinos film no respect for girls violence no respect for views visual he just make it the way he want to and that is the power that most of the directors cant have thats the power of the bravery you better watch this awesome film as fast as possibleumm i am speechless or in this case typeless to not even describe how this movie is. there is a turn at every corner and i mean awesome freaking out heart stopping scary stuff. also there are several beautiful visual effects going on here like the spectacular batman-jumps-out-of-window- into-plane-with-chinese-crook-in-hand stunt. that was awesome. the hospital explosion was great as well and harvey dies if you watched the first movie then prepare to get your shoes socks and everything blown off then this is the movie for you. i really sorry that heath ledger died though. he was a great actor in this movie. just watch it dont hesitate watch it. good luck.two hours and forty minutes summarize twelve years of a boys life the director richard linklater began this project in 2002 shooting one week per year linklater was able to show in a simple way the personality of a man being formed something never seen in cinemas for sure the screenplay is simple and doesnt appeal for melodrama even with dramatic moments they are always short scenes after all these moments happen in everybodys life but they always pass the simplicity of the screenplay is one of the biggest achievements of the movie without expository dialogues it totally convinces the audience but that happens because of the actors too mason the protagonist is interpreted by ellar coltrane his performance is very natural it is very interesting and touching the way that he grows up and discovers life its one of the subtleties of the movie beside mason the film ends up showing the story of the characters who are related to him patricia arquette is his mother the way that she transmits the growing of the character is impeccable other actor who is excellent in this film is ethan hawke masons father the dialogues between father and son are very natural which beatle is the best? are they going to make another star wars? etc richard linklaters direction is very good either first of all its necessary to highlight his courage and patience to realize such project the movie has some gorgeous sequenceshots some of them are even repeated as a narrative technique richard creates a very beautiful visual message the soundtrack is great too beside of memorable and touching the songs help to situate the audience in time for example the movie begins with coldplays yellow showing us that we are in 2002 boyhood is a movie like no other it is impossible not identify with at least one moment of masons life for that reason the innovation as a cinematographic work the direction details and the simplicity of the screenplay boyhood is a memorable movie one of the best if not the best of the yeartruly a strong addition to the marvel cinematic universe and faithful to its comics guardians of the galaxy does more than entertain the audience it takes the viewers to this level of awesomeness in a rather messy manner but its totally worth sitting through rocket and groot were my personal favorites i love the way the makers filled this movie with humor and style this is perhaps one of the strongest movies of 2014 along with marvels captain america the winter soldier perhaps slightly better depends on how you wanna look at it also id like to add that this movie is oscar worthy dont get me wronggroot is the best animated feature of the year so far and the visual effects were also pretty impressive only time will tell if this movie can maintain it i also love the fact that they are linked to the avengers via thanos if you havent watched it already go see it asaptruly a masterpiece. this film was more than worthy of its 11 oscars. the fellowship was stunning the two towers was inspiring but the return of the king was truly the greatest film i have ever seen. the thing that is most amazing about the return of the king is that it fills the jigsaw of its predeceors and does it with such epic granduer emotion and inspiration that i know very few people who were not amazed by it. i myself have read the lord of the rings by tolkien and in light of this can say that this film has to be one of the adaptations in recent times. peter jackson i feel simply could not have done a better job in using the beautiful new zealand landscape to portray tolkiens vision. without a doubt the speech roars and sheer numbers of the rohirrim at the pellennor charge in the sunset is truly the greatest sequence of film i have ever seen. people say the ending is too long i say it was perfect as it gave a heart felt and fitting deneaumont and ended a truly remarkable trilogy that will not be soon forgotten.toward the beginning of the film bruce willis face appears inside the sleaziest of bars in the san fernando valley but instead of the self-confident and wise-cracking characters he played in moonlighting and die hard he dons a very different mask we notice willis is not speaking but listening listening to a voice of authority played by a lesser-known actor ving rhames as some kind of underworld kingpin and then we understand willis is listening to a superior willis nods and speaks very little  he is subservient to this voice and the willis we have come to know is no longer willis but a pawn in a much larger game in which he does not wield much power this is one of my favorite scenes with willis showing his range as an actor and being able to descend from higher stardom into the lower depths of humility we learn that willis is being paid off for some kind of act the envelope containing the payoff money is presented by the kingpin whose face is yet unseen just as he is about to hand the goods over he immediately jerks it back willis does not try to grab the payment but sits patiently waiting for the superior to hand him the goods willis knows he cannot have the payment until the superior is ready and willing to give it to him the gesture is a symbolic reminder of who is really in power and its not willis willis humble scene captures well the flavor of the entire film called pulp fiction a masterpiece of sub-culture drama but definitely not for all tastes characters and story are all spontaneous these people live on the edge on the darker periphery of american reality instead of going to football matches they kill people in sporting events instead of having drinks at the hilton they overdose on intense psychedelics and if they arent careful they may end up either on the business end of some hit mans 45 or in a remote dungeon where people are into s & m this is certainly not for those whose favorite movie is the sound of music and their favorite music is sung by doris day samuel jackson and john travolta play two hit men in service to the kingpin underworld lord but they never discuss their missions instead they banter about all kinds of irrelevant subjects like the names for american burgers on the menu in paris this chit-chat is a breath of fresh air and probably a lot more realistic than other films in which characters are discussing the plot ad infinitum the hit mens stories intersect with another plot line involving bruce willis a boxer who is on the take from the same underworld lord to throw a fight but these are just the bare bones throughout the film the hit men the boxer and the kingpin weave an intricate tapestry of plots and subplots told in a non-linear style part of the beauty of pulp fiction that ranks it one of the most innovative of films is that it collates as a movie puzzle events occur out of sequence rather than told in a straight linear fashion scenes happen in the middle of the film that are the end of the story the first and last scenes of the whole film which are in my opinion the best are the middle of the story not the end and yet the events of the last half of the first scene are not shown until the very end which turns out to be the last scene of the movie but not the last scene of the story prior to pulp fiction i dont know if there existed any american movies daring enough to pull such cinematic misdirection and make it work some european filmmakers may have done this but rarely such an innovative structure has occurred in american feature films and yet tarantino makes it work and you understand by films end how all the pieces fit together the collation is similar to tarantinos first production reservoir dogs but he takes those innovations to the next degree because of the subject matter not everyone will be able to enjoy pulp fiction but i think thats a mark of a great film which is ironically what hollywood studio executives try to avoid hollywood wants everyone to like a film not just some people but the price paid for this curtailing to everyones tastes is a marked lack of visionary works luckily someone saw the value of pulp fiction and gave it the funding to allow it to happen the result is one of the most tantalizing of cinematic experiences but not the kind of movie youll give your grandmother totally and absolutely wonderful in every way. i could go on and on about the beautiful cinematography how the story was summed up in a very satisfying way and how spectacular the battle scences were but i think that my summary says it all. see it for yourself.tolkien s works had been put into tv with animation by rankin/bass 1977 and 1979. in 1978 ralph bakshi had animated the first two books of the famous trilogy to the silver screen. and now with todays technologyan all-star cast and a fabulous music  new line cinema has brought the the trilogy to a new level in a live-action spectacle and one of the best film series of the 21th century. each scene has hearta bit of humourheart-thumpin action and excellent effects. and i should like to tell you that rings is what got me to love four of the films stars - elijah woodorlando bloomviggo mortensen and liv tyler. in this adrenaline-rushing conclusion of our adventure the war of the ring has began and frodo & sam who are led by gollum continue their dangerous quest to destroy the one ring. but they are unaware of the trap that set for them by gollum. meanwhile aragorn legolas gimli and gandalf are united with merry & pippin at the now destoryed isengard thanks to them treebeard and the other ents. now the friends celebrated their victory. but aragorn was worried of frodo. and in the dead of the night pippin snuck out of bed to take a peek at sarumans palantir that was found and confiscated. but something happened the palantir showed him the eye of sauron and that he is planning to attack minas tirithtoday i had the pleasure of experiencing richard linklaters pet project boyhood this is easily the greatest cinematic experience ive had in a long time considering linklater is one of my favorite working directors i am happy to say that high expectations were surpassed this is his best work to date the concept of filming for 12 years couldve easily come off as a gimmick but thankfully linklater who is one of the least selfindulgent and relaxed directors out there uses this ambition with natural depth and substance the 12 year deal is icing on the cake this is top notch filmmaking on a technical and emotional level one of the best traits about linklater is that he never overplays tearjerking situations or gets unrealistically dramatic he really understands the human soul its an epic yet charming honest and down to earth film i feel like just about anybody could resonate with it in some way i can easily see this going down as a universally loved american classic right next to films like 12 angry men pulp fiction and one flew over the cuckoos nest i strongly recommend it to everybody its truly a film that deserves to be seen i cant thank everyone involved with making this masterwork enough for being so patient i think it dethrones there will be blood as my favorite film of the 21st century thus far go see itto put it simply this is one of the best movies i have ever seen writer/director quentin tarantino obviously spent a lot of time carving out this masterpiece quentin prides himself on being very talented at writing dialog and he proves it here more than in any other of him films in my opinion be warned though this movie is not for the faint of heart as it has sternum puncturing needles drugs and a lot of violence but that just adds to the movie for me the plot lines are masterfully interwoven and the characters are lifelike and very believable when i turned 40 i did something i always wanted to and rented out a movie theater and the one film that i chose for my friends and i to watch was pulp fiction it is at the top of imdbs top 250 and it is on afis top 100 for a reason it is master craft film making and it is one of my personal all time favoritesto call the shawshank redemption a great film would be doing it no justice at all. this is a film that when i watched it the first time i couldnt believe how good it was. i expected a film that would pass the time by and i got a film that i could identify with. if you are feeling sad and you think the worlds a rubbish place this fills you with hope. i love the opening scene where the camera pans around the prison and then the music kicks in it makes you feel awe-inspired. the acting was brilliant you believed what everyone said some films the words are delivered with such cheesiness and fake ness that it makes you want to throw up. i have watched spiderman and even the lines in that make you feel that they mean nothing they just sound good. the film and book reciprocated the message hope springs eternal which means so much because we always live in hope that tomorrow it will be better things might change for us and hope never dies. i think when tim robbins speaks about music how you can never take it away because its in your head. if i have a rubbish day at work then its true that music just lifts you which is re-emphasised with the scene where he plays the music full blast around the prison this of example of piece of script which means so much. the movie uses music to its full potential to give more impact to the words and the characters. this film cannot replicated because the film is a piece of art the director wanted to make money but he also wanted to make a piece of film that made you feel something that had some effect on you after the movie was over. the movie has no bad points its what a story should be about it takes you somewhere that you nether been and makes you feel you lived that experience and you can learn from that experience. the lines delivered will always be remembered get busy living or get busy dying this is the dilemma we face in everyday live. this will live in my memories forever not like the sorry cash-ins of movies. this is a brief synopsis of how great the movie is but words just seem so little to explain the brilliance of this film.to be honest i enjoy reading a good novel more than watching a film. you usually get far more character development than in a movie e.g. puzos the godfather. but not with shawshank. this is the closest thing film has to a perfect story. the characters pacing plot monologues and every other element contribute to an inspirational yarn with a fulfilling ending. brooks suicide is the only film scene that has ever moved me to tears and if you watch just one film in your life - let it be this. not a film which others have tried to mimic for a good box office e.g. lotr: the return of the king the godfather but an original stand-alone film that in my opinion will never be surpassed in qualityto be brief as a man who has watched thousands of movies in my life shawshank redemption is the best movie i have ever seen. the plot the way it develops the acting the portrayal of every human emotion and the ending makes 99% of movies seem like just a waste of time. i didnt see it until a few years after it came out. my sister said it was a great movie. it was on hbo so i watched it. i was speechless. i have always found it strange that it was from a steven king novel. ive read a few not that one and what comes through in the movie doesnt seem like anything that would be in a steven king novel. a better movie may come along but it may be a while.tim robbins as andy a successful banker that was arrested and charged and sent to the shawshank prison for the murders of his wife and her lover that he did not commit. morgan freeman as red the longtime lifer who serves as narrator and friend to andy. in order for andy to help the young man cope with prison as red is really used to it having lived there for years. red is also a smuggling expert at contraband and gives people cigarettes posters of rita hayworth to andy among other things. as people at the prison look up to him. red has also been denied parole so many times he looks at getting parole as useless along the way. both must deal with the harsh reality of prison. as both need to lean on one another to survive. and andy is beaten up by mark rolston as red and his thugs and after red is beaten up himself and paralyzed as andy is no longer bothered again. in the process andy is moved from the laundry job. andy works with the corrupt warden sam nortonplayed evilly by bob gunton and corrupt and sadistic guard captain hadleyclancy brown in the prison library and fixes taxes and money laundering for them personally. andy is placed in solitary confinement a couple of times once for refusing to not keep on money laundering for the warden. who in turn would take away his job and the library he has been working at. as he really wants to be released as he did not commit the murders. and with the help of the little rock hammer that he gets from red to build rocks to play checkers with to pass the time in prison. he wants something more to do that than. wont tell you nothing more as you have to see it for yourself. a movie of hope and encouragement. as it shows you should never ever give up hope as that keeps you going. robbins and freeman make a great duo. and the chemistry between them looks really real. great writing and great acting by them and the supporting players really you will love this movie if you had not seen it.three renowned actors and my favorite director quentin tarantino go on create a movie masterpiece. the amazing actor samuel jackson plays an astounding character who is the king of cool. in addition john travolta is a gangster who is up for any job. moreover john mccain plays a boxer who doesnt take the fall. not to mention the rest of the cast who each give a memorable moment throughout pulp fiction. theres no dull moments in tarantinos finest work. the story takes the viewer on ride through drug deception murder and everywhere in between. im a little bias towards jackson and tarantino but for any movie lover this is a must watch.this will be a short review not because i do not have time but because of the magnificence it brought to me is in my mind forever more. i remembered seeing this in the cinema of my hometown in sweden it was the best of my life. i had goosebumps throughout the whole movie. a must see for those who have not. even now i feel like a kid again watching it. my childhood of sword-plays with sticks in the forestspretending to be fighting an army of orcs is a truth while watching this with surround sound. the costumes the characters i salute tolkien for this glorious work and salutes jackson for the splendid adventure he has captures on the cinema screenthis was the one movie i had been waiting for all year so i wasnt disappointed when i saw it yesterday. i knew that there were some important scenes cut from the movie but it didnt matter to me because i know they will be there in the extended version dvd set. it was fantastic to see aragorn become who he was born to be it was his courage and belief in frodo that inspired many of the others to continue on. i think anyone would want someone like sam to be their friend his friendship had more power than the ring itself. i honestly cant decide which of the three are my favourites because i love them all but this definitely is a trilogy that ill never forget.this was the best batman movie ever. rip heath ledger but he brought the joker character to life. i personally would have called it the joker instead of batman because if it wasnt for the joker then the movie would have been boring.however i did enjoy a lot of the action scenes like the opening of the movie when the men with the clown masks were breaking into the bank. also the scene when the joker is trying to kill the comissioner & batman ties the rope around the vehicle & it flips forward. i thought that was a very cool special effect.i wonder if they are going to add robin as batmans side kick in the next one. cant wait to see the next chapter.this was probably my favorite trilogy of all time as throughout movie history there have not been all that many good fantasy movies that have been released so these films fill that void for me. this last chapter wraps up the story nicely as frodo and sam are very close to where they need to be and the army of sauron are trying to finish off man once and for all. this movie is a bit different than the last one in the fact that the hobbits frodo and sam and gandolf the wizard are more of the focus of this one rather than aragon gimli and legolos who were more the focus of the last one. this one has epic battles and great visuals as well. it is also very well acted. sean astin does a particularly good job as sam in this one as his character has a lot more impact in this one. all in all a very good movie that wrapped up a very good trilogy that was one of the few that did not have a weak movie in the bunch. i would write more but i am sure there are plenty of reviews that do the movie more justice than i can.this was one of the best movies i have ever seen my dad told me about this movie and at first i was reluctant to watch it because it looked old but after the first 10 minuets i was hooked it does kinda get confusing sometimes but you will defiantly pick up all the parts and by the end of the movie you will understand everything there is a perfect balance of action which includes blood shooting and wicked gun fights comedy because lets be honest samuel jackson is just down right hilarious there is a lot of cursing but it fits perfectly with the scenes i would totally recommend this to all of my friends couldnt think of a better way to spend a night then watching this movie 10/10 would watch againthis was my first movie ever.i mean it when i say that i have never been interested in jack squat before watching lotryesthe caps is important. i saw it in bahrain first in budaiyafor those of you who dont know where bahrain isfyi beautiful placemust go. anywaysi couldnt believe the story line and the details of the characters and where they come from as well as their homelandsits a completely different feeling whenever i watch it but i will always have that feeling in my mind that im watching something worthwhile which is better than whats out there nowwith one question. what wouldve happened if i never saw this movie i told my best friend at the time and no surprise he got hooked too. i think anyone in the world will agree with me when i say that lotr is the greatest and most respected movie series accompanied by of course the godfather. just ask aguero.and im an arsenal fanthis was a reflection of the count of montecristo especially the jailbreak scene. but still i find it fascinating enough to impress me and have a lot of ingredient included in it. this is probably the most amazing movies from the nineties apart from forrestgump and back to the future and all. it also reminded me of the series the oz its cool and all but theres this mainstream way of showing jail and high school as the same in hollywood a lot. probably so but im afraid that not to be true.and one more thing i noticed was that viewers seems to be confused a number of times as the story slips from one another scene and is really complicated. that is it started as a man who have been betrayed by his love to whove been framed then jailed bitched from there and rules there becomes everyones favorite and the warden becomes his worst enemy and teaches him a lesson while he was on the go.this trilogy took my breath away it made me laugh it made me wince it even made my eyes tear up in some parts but in totality what it did was completely blow my mind now lets get to the third chapter - the return of the king. unbelievable i will start with the acting. the entire cast was superb beyond imagination. firstly viggo mortensen again delivers a brilliant performance as aragorn of a king emerging from an outlaw. it has been wonderful to watch his steady transformation over the two previous instalments but it really comes full tilt here. sean astin also deserves special mention as the true hero that has been buried inside samwise gamgee surfaces in the final film navigating some of the films most frightening and suspenseful scenes. reliable as ever is sir ian mckellen as thee wise gandalf and now as general of the gondorian armies. finally worth mentioning is elijah wood and andy serkis. elijah perfectly portrays the pain and weariness of an eroding soul. and as the wonderfully created cgi masterpiece andy serkis brings life to the creature gollum through his movements and voice. next up is the direction and script. oh and how wonderful these aspects are peter jackson surpasses the scope and epic glory of the two astonishing previous chapters to bring us something beyond cinema and beyond epic. the craft with which the new-zeelander constructs this film is amazing. he builds in every aspect necessary to forward the narrative but gives it all ample time to wonderfully unfold. working from a brilliant script written by himself his wife fran walsh and phillipa booyens he creates the utter magic on screen that was so evident in the undeniably majestic literary masterpieces of jrr tolkien. the sweeping  just adds to the epic scope of the film and is so wonderful that it almost becomes a character all by itself. the story follows frodo and sams final steps towards mount doom with their treacherous companion gollum in tow. the other members of the fellowship are gearing up for the final battle of middle earth. aragorn is absent from the preparations while he recruits the army of the dead to fulfill their oath. using anduril which is the narsil after it has been reforged. the battle scenes are even more impressive than the visually stunning battle of helms deep from the two towers. with especially the battle of pelenor fields being up there with the final battle as some of the best battle scenes ever created. in the extended edition look out for the scenes where the terrifying witch - king of angmars true power comes into scope. many have complained about the films multi tiered ending. but to me this is a well deserved farewell to some of our most loved cinema characters. if there was an option to give this trilogy more than 10/10 i would but seeing as this is the highest honor i can bestow on it a 10 shall suffice.this trilogy is the best movie i ever saw. it contains everything that you will see in a movie fantasy horror drama action romance some comedy and more. the effects are great and its based on one of the best book i ever read. either the cast is very good chosen. jackson made everything good. it was great as i saw it for the first time. after that i saw the movies about teen times and every time i liked it more and more. i was very happy as i heard the news that the hobbit begun to be filmed and as i saw the first part i was very happy. only the cast was not very good for me but in all it was good. i cant wait to see in the cinemas the second part of the hobbit.this trilogy is the best ever. i love it  every time i watch those movies i realize that ill never be bored to watch them again. every thing is awesome from the story - till the screenplaypicturemakeupfashion design and the exceptional actors that make those movies a cinematic masterpiece and now after 10 years remains just as good from my point of view i think viggo mortensen would have deserved an oscar  best actor  for his role as aragorn  it fits him like a glove . congratulations to peter jackson and his entire team for his achievement and i look forward to see the movie  the hobitt this touching and heart warming film is the most perfect celebration of the human spirit i have seen. andy dufresne wrongly convicted of murdering his wife and her lover finds the strength not only to change himself but to bring hope to those around him in shawshank prison. this inspiring story is interwoven with a soundtrack which invokes every emotion from haunting and chilling to stirring and beautiful. when you go to see a movie and it touches you with its poetry music and its atmosphere and leaves you with a sense of victorious satisfaction it is a triumph. field of dreams was the first movie which invoked these emotions in me. shawshank redemption is even more powerful for its simplicity. it doesnt pretend to be clean nor could it be called a family movie. it is brutal and violent at times horrifying and sickening at others. however the title says it all. redemption is what this story is all about. and it is not necessarily redemption for the actual crimes you might have committed but it is redemption for the way you have lived your life. what emerges can only be called a maginificent piece of art. this is what movies were meant to be.this summer has been the summer of the comic book movie. amazing movies have come out of the genre this summer: iron man hellboy 2 and the incredible hulk from what ive heard to name a few. at a time when people need a hero to usher them through bad times theyve been there for them at the multiplex. weve seen these heroes deal with not only outward demons but inward demons as well anger hate alcoholism drugs etc. but none of them has dealt with them in the way that the dark knight doesthis single film alone qualifies tarantino as a genius excellent cast of characters intriguing dialogue subtle humor superb soundtrack everything it is one of my most favorite movies to watch ever the plot twists are excellent this raises the expectation for any other work that tarantino doesthis second film in the dark knight trilogy shows us the real side of christopher nolans the dark knight. from all of the batman movies and series ever made this is the one who stands out to be best. there is no way of mentioning this film without talking about heath ledgers performance as the joker he is showing us the dark and magnificent side of the joker heath ledger gives possibly his best performance of his life in this movie we have seen jack nicholsen as one joker before but ledger came up with this incredible interpretation of the character not the soft side but the evil explicate character we see in the comics. the tics the mind-blowing plans from the guy who doesnt come up with plans. christian bale is clearly the best batman of my choice he does the dark batman to his own and makes him his dark knight the cooperation bale nolan and ledger have had through this film is incredible making it one of the best films made of my opinion  for a truly excellent game all the elements must come together. everyone involved must have perfect form. director darabont must have been at the top of his game when he put this gem together. of course the actors were excellent  morgan freeman and tim robbins seldom disappoint. the thing that makes this movie exceptional is that darabont coaxed the best performances out of the supporting actors also. bob gunton and clancy brown were utterly believable and bad guys dont come much worse than them. the other essential ingredient for a successful movie is simple: it must have a well thought out plot with a perfect beginning middle and end. so many movies fall over by getting at least one of these aspects wrong. not so with shawshank redemption. just like goldilocks said this is just right buy this one for your home collection because youll definitely want to see it again.this review contains spoilers so better see the film and then read my review. sometimes it makes me wonder why this film didnt go well in the box office. shawshank redemption is not just about a story where a man escapes from a jail. it captures the life of people who spend their life in jail. i believe that jail life and free life are almost similar. sometimes we enjoy and sometimes we feel sad whether you live in jail or not. sometimes life doesnt make any sense at all. some people succeed in their lives with ease and some people faces a great deal of hardship and still wont succeed in their life. these people are forced to the point of desperation. what they should know is that all of us have a destiny to reach and the main thing which matters the most is hope which you should need until the moment you die. if you believe in yourself and have hope then one day you will reach your destiny in this life or in your after life.this film has really changed my way of looking the life.this one is by far the best of all batman-movies in my opinion. it has suspense right from the start and keeps you gripped till the end.the acting is simply brilliant. heath ledgers joker is the coolest villain ever and for me it is the best acting performance in the movie history apart that the directing from christopher nolan is amazing. the staging and screenplay is fabulous. you dont want to miss this one out even if you do not like superheroes surely one of the best movies ever. not my personal best but it is definitely in the top 10 so to all you movie lovers: if you have not seen this one yet do it nowthis movie was totally magnificent. peter jackson really shown 3 things he has created a saga as good maybe even better than star wars it has shown that it is way superior than the books and he has shown one of the best movies of all time. this movie won everything it was nominated for eleven and really deserved it. this movie was the only fantasy to ever win best picture and the third to win 11 oscars. this movie has brilliant effects acting and anything else you can want from a film. the hobbits acted way better than the second one this did have and ending and it was the best of the saga. it is all i can say and let me rephrase it i am a strict critic and this movie has shown one of the best achievements ever. it is totally over-the-top recommended.this movie was the best in the series simply because of heath ledgers rip fabulous performance. his portrayal of the evil mastermind joker was simply faultless. the other actors were good as well. even though in batman 3 batman met a more powerful foe in bane in this movie he met a villain with a brilliant mind in joker. also harvey dents transformation in two-face was nice he kept his coin tossing thing which i like in particular about him. he used his mind to catch criminals but from now on he will use his brain to be a great foe for our hero batman. i strongly recommend this movie for those who like this genre of movies inspired by comic books.this movie was simply fantastic. action packed suspenseful and yet still enchanting. acting in the movie is terrific especially from mckellen and mortenson. peter jackson reached new heights with this masterpiece completely deserving the best picture oscar. the plot follows the continuing adventures of the disbanded fellowship of the ring in their quest to destroy the powerful one ring. frodo baggins sam gamgee and their guide gollum are on a quest to the cracks of doom while the rest of the fellowship is preparing for war with sauron forger of the one ring and his soldiers. it this complex plot that is part of the reason that this film is so good. the cgi is breathtaking especially for 2003. everything in the movie looks lifelike. the cinematography in the movie is astonishing and sweeps one off of ones feet. battle scenes are brilliantly choreographed intense and high-octane. i know i dont seem too exited about this movie but this movie is terrific. if you havent seen this movie see it. it is a classic and one of the best films out there.this movie was released when i was all of 9 years old. lucky for me i didnt come across it until nearly 13 years after the fact. i have always been a movie buff and aside from that a big fan of the writings of stephen king. i had read the short story the film is based on and it led me to this film which i was certainly aware of prior but never checked out. afterwards i had a new list of benchmarks for certain aspects of cinema. first and foremost was the story itself. the writing of this tale in screenplay form is absolutely brilliant. the story is fleshed out without lingering in certain areas it would have been easy to linger in and the pacing of the film is steady and constantly building emotional atmosphere. from the early feelings of confusion and bitter justice as our main character is judged by his peers to the dawning realization of what shawshank penitentiary has to offer for its masses of convicted felons. it all flows fabulously as the tale unwinds from the darkest despair of prison life into the slowly building and palpable hope andy and red seem to cultivate for the rest of the prisoners. its this humanity in the face of inhumane conditions that is at the forefront of the shawshank redemptions impact. second but just as vital was the casting. tim robbins has always been in my mind a criminally underrated acting talent. he always seems to carry a sense of outward vulnerability that belies an inner strength and in that conflict one always questions his motivation his reason for doing things. his skill set was married perfectly to the character of andy dufrense who instantly seems in mortal danger within the walls of shawshank but eventually rises above the concrete and steel. indeed its safe to say that mentally at least andy spent very little time in that prison. morgan freeman played the role of red redding in a manner that i think no other actor could have done. he was not only a veteran of shawshank he radiated a sense of calm wisdom and strong sense of brotherhood amongst his fellow inmates that lend themselves very well to freemans on-stage abilities. as a man who can get things red is instrumental in many inmates lives in shawshank. offering a variety of contraband items in return for the typical currency of incarcerated peoples cigarettes petty cash red is as important a character as andy in terms of the films overall message of hope despite hopelessness. and morgan freeman was the best man for that job. the excellent acting doesnt end there. bob gunton who seems to find a niche in playing white-collar criminal types portrays the warden of shawshank as a sinister scheming man who hides his darker desires behind the bible and an arrogant holier-than-thou attitude. william sadler is another outstanding character actor similar to gunton whose face is more popular than his name and who does a fine job as heywood. one of the more important supporting roles was that of the hard right hand of the warden guard officer hadley who was portrayed by clancy brown well known for his bad-ass-type roles. his no-nonsense hard-edged persona fits well and leaves you hating his character but appreciating his ability to make you hate someone who doesnt exist. beyond the writing and the acting this movie was perfect in every other aspect. ive seen it many times over the years often turning to it perhaps subconsciously during particularly rough or depressing patches. ive very rarely come across a film that not only meets my expectations but exceeds them in a way that leaves me constantly comparing future films to it. the shawshank redemption is one of those films where the outstanding story and the remarkable talents of everyone involved combine to bring vivid fiction to life. a masterpiece of modern film-making that has lost none of its impact or relativity nearly 20 years later.this movie was really well done 100% through. it is one of those films that is a classic because it is a powerful story but its also an intelligent film. we dont see that too much and i hope to see more films like this it makes me think of the essence of filmmaking and storytelling and how much that aspect of our industry is really honored. every director wants to tell a great story but few let the story tell itself. this is an intelligent film because it gets so involved with our character driven plot lines that you forget youre watching a movie at all. as a young filmmaker this film is a fantastic model to build a foundation around. lets just hope studio thoughts dont pick up and they try to make a sequel/prequel...this movie was one of the best i have seen. the graphics were great. the way they put the whole movie together was just awesome. i loved watching every second of it. the first time i watched it i watched it three times in a row because i couldnt get enough of the movie. the lord of the rings series is just amazing in itself. what they have to go through with the ring and what they have to fight and figure out on the way there. i absolutely loved this movie. one that will definitely go down in the history books as an amazing movie. i think everyone should see this movie and the others before and after it. they might feel the same way that i do about it. i love itthis movie was honestly a lot different than i had expected i was expecting more evil on maleficents part however there was more depth in her character and i think the movie did a great job expressing her character in a more complex way it was definitely a lot sadder than i had expected i cant get over how great angelina jolie was as the part of maleficent her expressions were extremely detailed and i was very impressed with her acting i think this movie is a definite yes and i will be back in theaters to watch it again it was a beautiful film and i think many will find that it is much more enjoyable than they had expected i will definitely be recommending this movie to othersthis movie was great definitely a five star movie four star at the lowest tom cruise acted really well it was exciting and they didnt make it all killing death etc this movie was exciting as it sounded so there was no ripoff however i do think they could have created less talking and more doing so it would be very fun and not exactly like the real thing in life after all it is fictional stuff its no real its not based on a true story but besides that this movie was good this movie has very little cuss words which makes it more easier for more parents to saying yes to their kids on watching this awesome movie this is a movie for the young and old who love action like this i personally can not wait to get this on dvd and i can not wait to see its sequels mi2 mi3 and mission impossible ghost protocol you will want to do all the same enjoy this great movie that will always be a great spy classic for yearsthis movie was excellence at its best. in my mind it is great if you can watch a long movie and just not want it to end. thats what this one did to me. besides the point that the acting was some of the best youll see in the 90s. the story was golden. if you havent seen this get it now.this movie was an incredibly blend of everything that makes movies interesting and fun from completely three dimensional characters to witty dialogue to outrageously funny situations quentin tarantino has molded years of pulp noir into something truly his ownthis movie was amazing peter jackson has a true vision and this entire trilogy was wonderful. tolkien would be extremely proud. the only thing that bums me out now is the fact that there arent any more to look forward to next year... how about making the hobbit  its a sublime union that makes everything in the three movies relevant and provides satisfying closure all around. many liberties are taken from the original novels but for the big screen it works to generate the best possible spectacle and make the plot work evenly. themes of war corruption addiction good and evil and adventure all prevail. as before this film is crafted with excellent photography and editing. all the major players return and contribute fantastic performances in their respective roles especially viggo mortensen who stands out more in this film than before but it is always a pleasure to watch ian mckellen as gandalf along with the rest of the fellowship and all their allies. writing is superb. this production boasts some excellent sets props and costumes. special effects are huge  at its time it was most groundbreaking for generating the biggest armies ever seen on screen all at once. despite aging a bit the effects are still impressive. howard shores music  is as masterful as ever. return of the king delivers the best possible payoff for the lord of the rings trilogy and it might even outshine the hobbit saga in the end. not only does it boast some of the biggest battles but it is also a film with power and beauty. it has cemented itself as one of my all-time favorites was my number-one favorite for quite a few years and the lord of the rings saga overall remains one of the most sublime marriages between spectacle storytelling and style. if you watch the extended edition of this film you will be treated to about an hour of bonus scenes which offers a lot of excellent substance. among the additions there are longer battle scenes a scene showing the fate of saruman and wormtongue an extended encounter with the army of the dead a parley with the mouth of sauron and more. i think most of these scenes are really awesome and this version of the film is definitely worth seeing. 5/5 experience: perfect | story: perfect | film: perfectthis movie tops off what i as a fantasy lover have always dreamed of seeing. a world class true fantasy movie. this has to be one of the best movies i have seen in recent memory. the plot story line and peter jacksons vision were amazing. again if you want to see a movie with heart passion determination soul. then this is one that i would recommend a++this movie rock. best super hero movie of all times maybe. the joker stole the entire show. hes like a savage tornado on gotham city and only batman can stop him. the joker is not the only bad ass in town. two face is also here to make the life of batman a living hell. this film is not only an action movie but also a psychological drama. never in a batman movie a director explore so deep the mind of a super hero. christopher nolan make a wonderful job. the choice of heath ledger was a little bit critical but his performance shut all the critic up. and aaron eckart is the best two face ever. ok its not tough to top the performance of the other but.this movie represents the result of a hard working and amazing director peter jackson as well as amazing and emotive performances and the whole look is beyond epic. i love this film for its moral values there is nothing offensive in this movie which is refreshing and rare. an amazing conclusion to the best trilogy ever. expect amazing battle sequences great acting great cgi amazing moral values and messages just a perfect film. this is more than a movie it is an experience and rightly deserved the 11 oscars it proudly won. peter jackson really understands what the whole concept of lord of the rings is about he managed to capture the purity of frodo and sams friendship the epic nature of the big scale action sequences and i respect the script writing team philipa fran peter for creating the emotion which is filled in the film. this is a brilliant film which will last for generations :dthis movie really gorges with characters view angle and the normal from point a to point b is replaced with fickle sense of time  picture jumps round but in the same time gathers the plot in to one piece pulp is cult this movie really deserves to be #1 in the top 250. its just so cheerful. if you havent seen it yet first read the book or the whole trilogy then you will understand the movie. yes so i am not gonna tell you any spoilers. but if you read the book or saw the movie congratulations you understood the book and the movie at the same time. if you live in new zealand everyone and you really loves the movie and the book and that is why new zealand is famous because of the lord of the rings. the movie has great roles and characters like frodo baggins gollum sam gandalf the grey. and the movie is declared one of the best movies ever in numerous countries. and that was my review of the lord of the rings: the return of the king.  who are also known for their mesmerizing characters and self-referential dialog. what they get is that qts films are snub-nosed and brilliant with great inventive energy and personal to what qt is all about. like his predecessors who influenced him qt understands that skill and craftsmanship are only half the work and that a passion for sticking to your guns and making strong personal films makes up the bulk of all great hollywood legends. if you want to know what great film making is all about just watch pulp fiction and marvel at its excellence this movie proves its worth of having top spot on imdb list.it is not only entertaining but also with a lesson never loose hope as it is the best thing a man can have.great acting displayed by lead actors specially morgan freeman.truly a moving movie with great moral&climax.dialouges of this film are well written. you will miss something if have not watch it. highly recommendable for those who have give up their hope in life. they will find how hope will get best of them.i will say that viewers have truly voted for this film without under influence of big & popular name as it usually happens.like godfather.godfather is nice film but not nice enough to give points above 9 to it.this movie not so yang but still great you were terrified by actor in this story i think it is best movie from 90-x director is very creative person what stile we can call tarantino stile actors and play is great when i was watching this movie i feel atmosphere this story sone time i watch again this movie because i like this story and stile this movie you can split your live for to part: before watch this movie and after i like watch this movie which my friend you can start watching from any part that is ok tarantino is going to great master if he create only this movie it like icon cinema i havent watch movie lake this i mean so creative and unusually i recommended this movie for watchingthis movie is without a doubt one of the if not the greatest achievement in the history of filmmaking .it is not just the best movie i have seen in my entire life but my best cinematic experience.peter jackson has changed the history of cinema with the amazing magnificent epic saga lord of the rings.the return of the king is a great conclusion to this breathtaking saga and is far way better then the first two episodes.guys i do not recommend you to see this series you must see it. if you want to see a movie than see this movie .i am serious i have seen it 20 times without exaggerating and if you don t like it than you know nothing about movies.the movie has won 11 oscars and the whole saga 14 .the scenario is excellent the screenplay is superb the filming is perfect the costumes are magnificent the music is majestic.if i had too say one more thing it would be :go see this movie -. this movie is unpredictableif you avoid the many movie clips that is it is heartwarming yes it has action yes they also mixed in a lot of comedy and adventure it has a little romancevery little it is well written with great special effects and so it is really easy to recommend to the pg13 movie crowd i intend to buy it the second it comes out marvel and disney are going to make a ton of money on this excellent film it is the best of all the marvel films they have done i state that not owning one comic book or reading anything at all about this characters i hope they start working on the sequel as soon as possibleand that they keep the same writers and the same directorthis movie is undoubtedly one of the best of the decade its like no country for old men lord of the rings gladiator the departed there will be blood and the dark knight all of them considered the best of the 2000s its the first of its kind and it doesnt turn out to be a money grab but instead a must see because it takes place over 12 years the acting changes and so does writing directing and the overall environment simply it matures if this isnt up there for best pic at the oscars someone will have to answer for there crimes ps not a family movie more details in parents guidethis movie is the third of a trilogy which starts off with the lord of the rings: the fellowship of the ring and then the lord of the rings: the two towers and ended with the lord of the rings: the return of the king which is what i am writing about now and i believe it was the best out of the three. it was intriguing and mysterious which is what i enjoy when watching a movie. it goes for a fair amount of time just like the rest of the movies in the trilogy but it is worth it and you dont get bored unlike what you do in other movies that just go on forever about non-interesting things with no action. if you enjoyed this trilogy of the lord of the rings then i highly recommend you watch the trilogy of the hobbits.this movie is the most amazing in the industrys history . the best in the way it shows sequence of the events . morgan freeman played a remarkable role in the movie .... movie has the successful mix ever made of emotions anger  peace  mystery  hate  love  betrayal and friendship ... this movie will always be milestone in the history of film industry .... view and full interaction figures and the absolute harmony between the team of the film clearly reflected in the article submissions .... the imposition of the spirit of the prison and the transfer of the wonderful scenes that way like a prisoner until the end of the film when liberated liberally of movies main characters essence of success was felt throughout the film that he is no life outside the walls but in some scenes .... its a perfect work by the standards of the industry ....this movie is the best of everything the charaters are the best with each other and their environment. you have to love the pros as well as the antags. this movie as one reviewer once said of this movie it is the best movie of this generation the saddest part it is the last movie. the only thing i have to say that was a downer it needed more epic battles so my top 5 have now changed: 5=scarface4=matrix3=lord of the rings 32=godfather1=citizen kane.this movie is the best movie in batman trilogy.its a wonderful acting by christian bale and heath ledger.according to me heath ledger was the most appropriate for the role of joker.but it is very sad to tell that heath ledger is no more among us. movie is full of thrill and bruce wayne with many more gadgets.bale as usual has given us an another wonderful movie.the best part of the movie is that it keeps you enrolled. bales seriousnessmichael caines advisesmorgan freemans humor and jokers dialogues keeps you free of boredom. this is must watch for bales and waynes fans. this movie is not just 1 time watch and whoever do not love batman i would surely ensure that after watching this movie they would forget that they once hated batman. on the whole this movie is just awesomethis movie is so famous believable and intriging that many rumors are circulated about it as if it were more than just a movie which is basically all that it is pulp fiction is a perfect example of how effective a good film can be while becoming a part of american culture its one of those times when you want to seek the director and badger him with questions only to not recieve answers because shallowing a deep masterpiece would only take away the magic pulp fiction is not an exercize in creating thick plots but one in creating believable charasmatic characters all they do is talk simply because theyre cool funny charming fictional people whom we love to see talking the movies primary way of entertaining us is by showing us how each person talks uniquely and like every great film it relies heavily on performance its one of my top ten and i give it a ***10****this movie is simply the best superb script directing and acting this movie cant really be compared with any other movies since its so different the story line jumps around and youll see scenes from other perspectives later in the film there is no start there is no ending but its a very good movie ether youll hate this movie or youll love it you will probably love i did and a whole generation with methis movie is quite possibly one of the greatest movies ever written and produced tarantino is a brilliant storyteller and one of the best in the business reservoir dogs exposed us to qt but pulp fiction made him a godthis movie is probably one of the greatest movies in the 21st century everything about it just spell genius all the charactersthe performancethe directingthe storyline and the actionbut contrary to what people may thinkheath ledgers joker wasnt the best thing in the movie all the actors deserved oscar nominations because the acting they did was marvelousor dcious see what i did thereanywaychris nolan just max out in genius and visionary and innovationits an amazing masterpiece that doesnt have a single flawa lot of the movies lately just gives you a choice quality or fun which is the case with marveland dc movies these days the mcu just gives full throttle awesomness and fun while the dccu tries hardly to have quality by making its movies serious and sad but fails horriblyyesman of steelim talking about youat least marvel successfully delivers fun and mind blowing action scenesbut this movie doesnt give you a choice it delivers: funawesomenessseriousnessqualitymeaningactingdirecting cinematography and just a heck of a villaini think the joker was awesomein every way but i think hes a wee bit overrated everything in the movie is mind blowing and deserves more credit as a movie than just one actors great performance. watch the dark knight it changed my life just as it will do to youits the godfather of our timethe stairway to heaven of moviesa complete and utter masterpiece which lacks nothingit may be the best movie of your life it may not but theres one thing for sure you will not be disappointedi think calling it an epic masterpiece is underselling it i think its much more than that its a life changing event in cinema an absolute thriller and magnificent story. its one of the greatest movies of all time.this movie is poetry. for those of you whove ever felt the way poetry rolls off of the tongue youll understand what i mean when i say this. the first thing that makes this movie great is morgan freemans ability to narrate the way he does. his soft yet ruff voice provides the audience with the belief that this man has endured many years of hardships and has gained wisdom and experience through trial and error. he is a natural story teller so his ability as a narrator is natural and smooththis movie is one that gives to wit the most part of being happy in this life. it is true that you might not be lucky enough in life but even in the midst of crap even when all your life has crumbled over your face hope is still your last hope. one night he caught his wife cheating and was thrown in jail for a murder that he had not committed and after all that he got raped what would you have done had you been in his shoes keep on hoping well andy not only had hope he gave hope to his fellow prisoners. the brilliant morgan freeman gives the cherry on the top in this movie and if he werent in this movie the movie would have lacked something for sure. there are scenes and lines that you will never forget in this movie and i have commented on hundreds of movies but very few i gave the full 10 out of 10 and this movie is one of those few.this movie is one of those ones that makes you think really deep about life your life morgan freeman makes us feel the sadness and tim robbins the faith in a dark atmosphere.this movie is one of the best movies ive ever seen. it has comedy suspense action everything you could want in a movie. this movie is brilliant it may be the single best movie ever this movie has the best casts assembled ever from samuel l. jackson to john travolta to bruce willis. then how viewers are taken through a journey of 3 stories that all intertwine together. nothing is predictable through the movie like most movies are. quentin tarantino is an directs this movie amazingly. this movie is a all-time classic that you could watch 100 times and never get bored of it. the first time i watched it i watched it about 10 more times right after that because it was so good.this movie is one of the best ive seen if not the best i feel mr jackson should have gotten an oscar nomination for his role as jules forest gumps tom hanks wouldnt have stood a chance  john travoltas performance was good but could not beat samuel l jacksons portrayal of jules the hitman i liked the scenes being presented asynchronously giving the sense of peoples worlds being connected but they the characters not really being aware of the interconnectivity of their lives roles the violence in the movie is not gratuitous hope im using this word correctly  the car scene was especially good as was the cleaning of the car scene  dialogue excellent  and getting medieval on your ass will forever be with us  also going over this neighborhood with a blow torch and a pliers  what i also liked was the realism of the movie  i mean no cops around when you need them  in another movie the screen would have been swamped by blue and whites but not here  just pure unadulterated violence this movie is one of the best i have ever seen. i first read the book and i didnt liked it that much but then i saw the movie. and thats a things thats never happened to me before the movie was better than the book. its the other way normally. but in this case the movie is so much better i like the end more than in the book. watch the movie it is great.  but if you pay attention you shall see what he mean. in fact all the hole charm of tarantino is his way of make a good plot showing little details and thats make this unique at all. you can know all the hole life of the character just listening well the dialogs in the movie...and this is fantastic in a strange way. well my last word is: watch this movie is one of my all time favorites. undoubtedly one of the most brilliant movies i have ever seen. story cast screenplay all are great. the directing by frank darabont was just magnificent. the amazing casting of both morgan freeman and tim robbins is amazing and couldnt be more accurate. it was narrated by morgan freeman who is the best narrator in hollywood i believe. actually the film depends on the story and the way in which it unravels. it will change the way u think about things around u. surely it will teach you one thing that it is easy to take away a mans bread even his freedom but impossible to take away his hope. i can say with confidence this is the best movie i have ever seen - or ever will see. if you havent watch it yet just go watch it now  you couldnt just hold off on the rest of the series if the fellowship of the ring didnt pan out financially. the emotional payoff of the film is testament to the work on all ends of production for everything from the script to the on-screen talent to the set decorators to the sound designers creates the aura of authenticity that makes this fantasy feel so real and convincing while also pulling us along on an emotional journey in which we feel so heavily invested by the time frodo and sam reach the summit of mt. doom. as with their journey in the story once youve gone this far as a viewer youre incredibly committed to the outcome and what an outcome. bravo. ~steven c thanks for reading visit moviemusereviews.com this movie is not your ordinary hollywood flick. it has a great and deep message. this movie has a foundation and just kept on being built on from their and that foundation is hope. other than just the message of this movie the acting was phenomenal. tim robbins gave one of the greatest performances ever. he was inspiring intelligent and most of all positive. his performance just made me smile. robbins plays andy dufresne who was wrongfully convicted of murdering his wife and her lover. he is gets to life sentences but yet never gives up hope. in he becomes friends with ellis boyd red redding played by morgan freeman. freeman who gives the finest performance of his career has unlike robbins lost hope. he is in deep regret of the crime that he committed. his way of deflecting the pain away is by trying to not feel anything at all. with his friendship with andy he learns that without our hopes and dreams we have nothing. andy also becomes friends with the rest of reds group. james whitmore also gave a great performance as brooks halten who gets out of prison parole but in the words of red he has been institutionalized. the directing by frank darabont was just magnificent. he kept this movie at a great steady pace along with the writing and great cinematography. he portrayed prison life in such a horrifying way but not in terms of the physical pain but the stress and pain that wares mentally on the inmates some of which deserve a second chance. whatever you do dont listen to the people who say this movie is overrated because this is one of the most inspiring and greatest movies ever. it has everything you could possibly want.this movie is more than just a movie this is about freedom and peace between each other many people will learn something watching it about how the mind could be free when your body is not... thatÓ‰s all i have to say about the greatest movie of all times thanks if you have read my comments d@vethis movie is like no other i can say drama action fantasy probably one of the 20 best movie of all time many good actors on the cast great music and special effects... long enough about two and half hours.. i wish hollywood to give to us one movie like this one once every year... but thats to optimistic: this movie is like no other i can say drama action fantasy probably one of the 20 best movie of all time many good actors on the cast great music and special effects... long enough about two and half hours.. i wish hollywood to give to us one movie like this one once every year... but thats to optimistic: this movie is like no other i can say drama action fantasy probably one of the 20 best movie of all time many good actors on the cast great music and special effects... long enough about two and half hours.. i wish hollywood to give to us one movie like this one once every year... but thats to optimistic:this movie is just the pinnacle of movie-making from the bizarre yet believable situations to the dialogs between characters there is probably no other movie where i enjoy myself more the story is non- linear but the thing is is that it doesnt bother the viewer at all the legendary opening the legendary ending the quotes the soundtrack the performances this might just at well be considered the perfect me to me it is i rarely give a movie 10/10 but pulp fiction is the movie that deserves it because there is no possible way you could improve it on a personal note there is something about this movie that truly makes me nostalgic although it is stuffed with violent and nihilistic themes this movie is like a big goodbye to the good times and an in-your-face times will never bee this cool againthis movie is just beyond great. everything about it was pitch perfect. the acting was fantastic especially from ledger and bale . bale and ledger just worked so well together in the scenes that they were in. ledger was the perfect joker. he had the ability to be as dark as the people wanted to see from joker he had the voice the tone and the look of joker. he was able to bring the best out of everyone that he was in a scene with and that is what made him a true highlight of the movie. it will be very hard to find someone that can portray joker quite like him. now on to bale. christian bale was as good of a batman as one can be. not only was he great as batman but also as bruce wayne. bale was the best bruce wayne that i have seen in my time of being a batman fan  which is a very long time . now i know that some might disagree with that but im sticking to my statement. the next reboot of batman will have a lot of pressure to top not just this trilogy but just this movie.this movie is just as great as the three before it. the camera angles lighting and effects were amazing. i am so proud of the actors viggo orlando elijah ian and everyone else without this amazing cast lord of the rings would not feel the way it does. andy serkis props to you for your amazing portrayal of gollum and all the effort to get all those jumping shots in. the camera crew showed their worth with the excellent filmography. ever angle gave meaning and ever sound effect chilled you with pride. with all these factors i feel proud to be alive when beautiful films like this are made for us to enjoy. intense nostalgia grabs me when i watch this film now and i couldnt be more happier.this movie is great it has everything in it. fantastic acting by all actors and actresses. the dark knight is darkgrandiose and mad and hugely entertaining. the screenplay is really awesome from the start to the end i love heath ledger as the joker and christian bale as batman every time those come on screen together it gives me goosebumps. i liked batman begins and dark knigt rises to but this is absolutely a master piece from christopher nolan. nolan totally smashed the trilogy from the 90s. for me this is one of the best movies ever made i hope you all enjoy the movie rip heath ledgerthis movie is excellent why most importantly it is original it can be said quite accurately that many elements of this film have been stolen from other films no one can ever accuse quentin tarantino of not doing his homework repo man or la femme nikita as obvious examples he even rips off much of his own material from reservoir dogs but the manner in which these elements are chosen and assembled is both inspired and original many people have stated that pulp fiction has been proven great by the amount of imitation that it spawned frankly i dont think imitation proves anything and i dont think pulp fiction was imitated significantly more than many other highly successful films however to my mind pulp fiction is great because it manages to recycle a multitude of pop culture icons that were seemingly over-used to death and somehow put them all together into something fresh and interesting pulp fiction also has a few truly original moments christopher walkens wonderfully dry delivery of the your father kept this watch in his ass for years story is hilarious there is only one serious flaw in this film: quentin tarantino is a very poor actor thank god he confined himself to a small role if he really feels the need to be onscreen he should just go ahead and pull a hitchcockian cameo in his films sure its derivative but at least his screen presence will be minimizedthis movie is excellent and it has some great special effects the acting was also good i got sucked into the movie right from the start thats what i call moviemagic theres not many movies or producers can do this so big shoutout to christopher nolan i saw no flaws to the movie and the movie is very original i havent seen any movie like this before the idea is brand new for the movie and its perfect the question many people ask how will the earth and the humans be in 100 yearsor longer and i like how this movie shows possibilities over what can actually happen cause nobody has any idea whats happening in a 100 years i also like the more than 3 dimensional talk in it all in all its a good movie and i recommend a watch this movie gets 1010 from me because its a long movie with a lot of as i would like to call them tear scenes and joy scenes it brings you so far into the movie and its great written by johnthis movie is epic. it takes the best of the book and increased to become something great. all the characters are well embedded the drama of each is well explored. viggo mortensen is the perfect aragon. better than fellowship of the ring. better than the the two towers tolkin rest in peace. because your job of your life was not thrown in the trash peter  you are the guy... this movie is epic. it takes the best of the book and increased to become something great. all the characters are well embedded the drama of each is well explored. viggo

of the year  perhaps of the decadei think it probably impacted me more than othersbecause i have a similar age that the actor haveso it was kind of nostalgic in some situations i could see the changes that the actors were having in a subtle way and that was just very naturalits very interesting you see a 10 years old boy playing video games and in just some minutes the same boy looking for a job or looking for relationshipsit shows in a brilliant way how time its easily gonei dont really think it is possible to do a spoiler with this movie  but if its possible  perhaps the following paragraph may contain the end is fantasticin the very moment the movie is over  you thinkyou feel the moment present moment and you just know that life is built of little moments  and this movie was certainly one of minethis movie is by far the best out of the batman trilogy. i think the joker made the movie with his new darker and scarier theme. dont get me wrong christian bale also did an amazing job but heath ledger made it. it is very sad that heath has passed but this movie will go on in history and i dont know about everyone else but i find this movie one of heath ledgers best movies i have seen. just the fact that he did an amazing job playing the joker and brought the character to life. i think thats what made it so amazing. if heath were still here i think we all wouldve liked to see where his career wouldve went after this role.this movie is based on a novella by stephen king but dont let that put you off. its not a horror film rather a thumpingly good ode to friendship hope wit wiles and wisdom brimming with crackling characters and topped with the most twister of twists since the crying game. found guilty of killing his unfaithful wife and her lover in a fit of passion sullen accountant andy dufresne robbins casting off his goof ball image to display more layers than the proverbial onion is shipped to the gothic wind-swept corridors of the shawshank state prison for life. it is here the movie gracefully unfolds. with a beautifully rounded script writer/director darabont conjures up a spellbinding personal odyssey stretching through the years from 1946 to 1967. dufresne all the while protesting his innocence slowly overcomes the hellfire tortures of the prison system - an unblinking range of beatings rapings and abject humiliations - while managing to inspire his fellow inmates to lift their degraded horizons. among them is red freeman in a matchless supporting role the lifer who can given time provide virtually anything. and for reasons best known to himself dufresne requires 40s starlet rita hayworth provisioned in poster form. the mood swings rigorously through every emotion as the cranky wise guy and downright crazed array of criminals bare the brunt of the turbulent life within the doomy shawshank catacomb. then it gets really mean gearing up for its injury-time shockers. dufresne a whiz with figures is bullied into running the wardens gunton petty accounting scams giving him the chance to execute his and the films final greatest miracle. if youre miserable enough to look for gripes then yes it does drift on too long and who needs prison buggery again yet the ending has such poetic completeness youre too busy contentedly chuckling to worry about sore behinds. this may have confounded american audiences - it flopped big-time on planet yank - but a more divine movie experience you will not find this side of oscardom. spread the word.this movie is an instant classic. everything about it is perfect - the acting the special effects the plot the music and the complete and utter emotion it contains. it will be remembered for years to come and its story will be passed down for generations. i have seen hundreds and hundreds of movies and this one will always be my favorite. this is the movie i will show to my children and tell them how great it is until they tire of hearing about it from me. i have grown up reading the books and this movie did not disappoint. nothing else has come close and nothing ever will. i hope for everyone to enjoy this movie and cherish it as i have and will. kudos peter jackson. continue to amaze and inspire us with your work.this movie is a total proof that christopher nolan is actually a very forward director he claims the batman franchise with a very unique and dark film about the most prolific hero of dc. and its not just about the direction of nolan what makes this movie one of the best of all the times there are the stunning casting. heath ledger show us with that clever performance how to reinvent a character as the joker which is one of the best villains ever made and he just add another element and history to him. also christian bale performance is a highlight for me is the best batman of all just because of the darkness in the voice and the capacity to show us the two parts of bruce wayne. im not surprised that this film is in top 10 of the best films ever made because it captures all the single parts of an amazing film.this movie is a must watch for any and every person no matter the race or gender. the only thing that is not good about this movie is that it has an end. its quite depressing. i have watched this movie at least once a new year and ever road trip. its very entertaining kills time inspiring awesome action scenes and the work on the uruk-hai and the other beasts is incredible. as with the first two the film is very long but goes by without you ever truly realizing it. this film is so much more than a simple fantasy epic. its a story about strength of character friendship loyalty and love. and while every member of the fellowship has their part to play i finally understood why some critics have said this series is a story about sam. its his unwavering resolve that led the quest to its victory. sean astin is a true credit for adding the inspirational heart to this epic. as as far as the ending goes they ended it the way that it had to be ended. jackson ended this film the way it should have been. this is probably the best movie ever made. if there was a rating higher than 10 i would give it. excellent 10/10.this movie is a masterpiece on every level all the references to mcdonalds the cereal that was discontinued which quentin has saved and put into the movie it is all a piece of american culture and coming from a guy from europe i simply love all that brand stuff following criminals in their daily lives hearing their dialog - is wonderful and it makes for a lot of wit it is bizarre contrast between murder and funny discussions the acting well i think john travolta was bad even tho he got critical acclaim but samuel give the performance of his life the drugs i like that this movie didnt focus on sex it feels so cheap instead it depicts a housewifes cocaine use classy scenes of injecting top grade heroin it is all very stylish and really makes the movie sexy it didnt feel like a cheap trick it is morbid humor appealing to all of us mainstream moviegoers as well as for respected criticsthis movie im not going to call this film the imdb #1 movie but i really cant deny that this is fantastic. the cast the  the writing and the power are all here in this film and filled with strength. its one of those movies that you will continue to think about even after the film is over. it is about a friendship a life an evil and a hope. a hope that is considered in many ways to be bridge to insanity inside the prison walls. we see these people as years of time goes by. we see friendships grow and topics change. it really puts you in the prison and makes you feel whats like to behind those bars. you feel the friendship the hope the darkness and the pure horror of it all. 4 stars out of 4this movie hit it right out of the ball park for me reading all of these negative and cynical reviews has me stumped i thought this film was way better than i expected it to be even my dad who is quite a tough movie critic thoroughly enjoyed it although everyone is entitled to their opinion to me this movie is one i could watch over and over again and i highly recommend it its perfectly written and the acting is right up there along side the amazing script the movie flows together youre never wondering whats going on or have to worry about getting confused because its so detailed and thorough

many of its viewers david fincher is someone ive come to admire as a filmmaker with his movies like se7en and social network so i obviously was interested in seeing this especially after watching the first trailer fincher and his marketing campaign made a smart move in not showing any big plot points in the trailers yet managed to keep you intrigued not something you see a lot of these days in movie trailers since this is a spoiler free review i wont go into too much of the details but this is probably the best performance ive seen from rosamund pike and the same for ben affleck i first noticed pike in movies like jack reacher and the worlds end and now i have a lot more respect for her as an actress ben affleck ive always liked as an actor before even in his directorial efforts and this id say is one of his best performances tyler perry who ive felt indifferent towards really impressed me here as the lawyer who helps ben afflecks character face the accusations against him neil patrick harris on the other hand made me feel uncomfortable in the wrong way nothing against the guy though but i dont think he was the right choice for the character he played gone girl does an excellent job of showing you how a persons life can crumble to the ground based on a few lies the media throws around just to bump up the viewership ratings and how a lot of us tend to believe everything that comes out a reporters mouth without considering that theyre might be more underneath the surface than what theyre showing you it also stands as a harsh and cynical commentary on marriage and how it falls apart based on how you treat your spouse and without giving anything away the marriage portrayal in this film makes me never want to get married or have a relationship put this in the hands of a lesser filmmaker gone girl wouldnt be getting the response its gotten its pretty clear that fincher is sitting behind the camera with his bleak tone dark color palette and how pessimistic everyone feels about life in general combine finchers direction with the screenplay by gillian flynn the author of the book of the same name there are so many twists and turns that suck you right in trying to figure out what happens next and has one of the most shocking scenes thatll blow your mind gone girl is a film that people will remember for a long time myself included and im willing to call it one of the best of 2014 i look forward to whatever david fincher does in the futurethis movie has some of the best dialogue i have heard in movies even though it doesnt have a lot of action this movie kept me hooked because of the interaction between the characters for example the entire scene where they are trying to clean marvin out of the car harvey keitel interacting with samuel l jackson and john travolta with a cameo from quentin tarantino this scene was one of my favorite from any movie another scene that i really enjoyed was the gimp scene with bruce willis and marcellus wallace dont know the actors name the only scene that i dont really like is the one with bruce willis and his girlfriend in their apartment even though it has some great dialogue i didnt really care for their relationship but this movie has some of the best comedy scenes and tense scenes like the final standoff as wellthis movie has many stories to tell. every scene has its own story. i like the way morgan freeman narrates in the movie which makes it all the more interesting. the scene where andy gets beer for his coworkers. also when he plays the two italian singers on prison radio. brooks last few days.and how red comes to terms with his freedom. i recently watched it for the first time and cant believe how i could miss this for so long. i also cant believe morgan never won oscar for this. i cant think of any better performance than this.truly deserves the number one spot. since last week i have watched it 3 times and plan to watch it again. thank you frank darabont for giving us hope.this movie has is all.. good actors good story and a helluva speed all through the movie.. you will never be bored when watching this movie.. with so many good actors in one movie you could think that it would not be a good movie. but in my opinion this is the best movie john travolta & laurent fishbourne ever acted in.. they both are in their peak performance.. one very cool thing about this movie is that you may think that you know whats gonna happened next... but believe me you dont have a clue... i have seen this movie at least 50 times already.. and i could easily watch it 50 times more without getting bored.. it deserves a big 10/10.. if you havent seen it go get a copy immediately..this movie has got to be one of the craziest films ever made. including the all-star cast & the different story lines how it all comes together in the end so to speak is brilliant. first time i seen this i didnt know what i was in for but glad i did. tarantino at his original best is still around the time this film was made. 5 stars qt this is by far one of his best works now lets just hope that mr. willis doesnt want to do a 2nd part to this ... that would be just scary. dont know hoe wed be able to handle a all new version remake or sequel: zeds dead baby ... wait no hes back as a zombie :-this movie has everything the final chapter of a trilogy needs it is absolutely amazing in every single aspect that i am finding it tough to even find one fault in it. the acting was astonishing right down to the all the bad ugly looking creaturesabsolutely amazing special effects and peter jackson deserves one big round of applause for this filming masterpiece. in this movie frodo and samastin and wood did amazing jobs considering to their roles and kept their friendship going and merry and pippin also played their roles amazingly well when they were handed bigger roles in this third and final installment of the trilogy.bloomdavies reprised their roles exceedingly well and there is no movie at all without aragornviggo mortensen.he did everything possible needed of him and he met each and every one of those expectations great job done their. ian mckellen also does a very good job and there was no movie if it was not for the special effects the battles were astonishing in this movies which makes me want to keep watching the movie over and over again. all said and done this is the finishing touch to an absolute masterpiece and the final block of the puzzle to the lord of the rings trilogy.the acting was made to perfection and if i was given the chance i will praise this movie over and over again together with the previous two movies. this movie provides entertainment to every person around and it deserves the credit it gets. overall i will give this movie a 10/10. an unforgettable masterpiece in my opinion.this movie has everything great actors fun action and awesome dialogue. the only thing this movie is missing is a theme which in my opinion adds to the fact that this movie rocked my world. you dont have to think too much about it it may take you a few times to watch it to appreciate it though. the first time i watched this movie the only thing i was thinking when it was over was whatttt the second time i watched it it turned into my favorite movie. i really cant explain why i like the movie so much it just sort of stuck with me. john travolta and sam jackson are incredible they show what hit men talk about when they arent killing people. uma thurman is cheezy and perfect for her role as the hit mens bosss wife. simply put this movie is incredible but it may take you two viewings. ten stars from me.  pulp is a throwback to those crime cereals that were so prolific in newspapers and comic books of the 70s as well as a throwback to the classic mobster movies many of us grew up with. some people see this as a weakness to quentin tarantinos direction saying that hes limited to only making homages to other things in popular culture. i dont think thats true personally but in my opinion its one of his strengths. he takes a genera that is well known and popular and gives it a very fresh twist. he did that with pulp and he continues to do it today with films like kill bill and inglourious basterds. boiling pulp fiction itself down however the true lovers of cinema the people who will know exactly what tarantino is referencing or paying homage to are the ones who will get the most out of this film. that is however not to say that casual viewers wont like the film. it has a little something for everybody and is without a doubt one of the best films of the recent generation. i hope you like this review and take it into consideration if you decide to see the film. this movie has a great plot and good acting the characters are fantastic and the action sequences are impressive. subtle plot points may be missed easily so you have to watch the movie again to get the full plot. however realism is another storythis movie guardians of the galaxy is a marvel movie about 5 space criminals who works together in order to stop ronan the accuser in destroying the entire galaxy these comics were only known by few people it became famous when the actors were announced to play each of their characters it became more famous when the trailer and the movie was released the movie was liked by everyone and this movie is very excellent you will enjoy this movie for sure unlike other marvel movies there were jump scenes unlike here there wasnt any and this movie is also a funny movie and even the after end credit scenes dont miss all the fun in guardians of the galaxythis movie doesnt deserve a 10 it deserves a 11... this is the best movie i ever saw everything on the movie is great the story the acting the message just everything. i spoke with so many people that saw this movie and everyone of them said that the shawshak redemption is a truly masterpiece. if someone is reading this- please stop reading and go and watch the movies if you havent yet because you will see one of the best movies ever made in human history. it is the best rated movie 9.2 and when i see that rating im just asking myself why is there just a 9.2 instead of a 10this movie despite the fact that i have now seen it more than 20 times never gets old and certainly never fails to impress the actors show just how talented they are and how much they are capable of the scenes might seem to not make sense in the order they are in during the first time you watch it but i assure you that after a second or maybe even third time everything will fall into place and amaze you this movie basically has no flaws and demonstrates how amazing the art of cinematography can be many people underestimate the skill and class it takes to create such a movie but it is blindingly obvious that this film belongs in the top 100 best movies of all time in everyones mind this is my opinion on the film it might seem overrated to you because i am a huge quentin tarantino fan but this movie left my mouth wide open and i cannot do otherwise but recommend itthis movie defines excellence in the field of comic book heroes and in the field of cinema. its a crime that this film wasnt nominated for best picture because it clearly was the best film of the decade. no other comic book hero will ever surpass this film because you cant beat perfection and this movie is perfection. i can say that i have seen the dark knight at least twenty times and my life and yes at times it gets boring but i keep watching because i love watching perfect films. if i see this movie come on television i always record or watch it. i wont skip out on that. it will be hard to make another batman story with the fact that christopher nolan has changed comic book movies forever with this one filmthis movie completes the series perfectly jackson is a genius. this movie is a must watch for any and every person no matter the race or gender. the only thing that is not good about this movie is that it has an end. its quite depressing. i have watched this movie at least once a new year and ever road trip. its very entertaining kills time inspiring awesome action scenes and the work on the uruk-hai and the other beasts is incredible. i only hope they make a remake that is even better than this movie if thats possible. all those haters who say that this movie is boring then they are missing the point and i would love to see what movies they find interesting. if there was a rating higher than 10 i would give it hands down. overall = amazing 10/10this movie captures many of things that made us love movies in the first place it is a movie that contains many beautiful messages about life in general and how we should always be grateful for what we have its about friendship its about dedication and determination it teaches that we can find beauty in the most difficult situations and places. i rated this movie 10/10 because i seriously couldnt find any flaw the direction script acting production values and acting. what i like about this movie is thats all about humans its about the simple human needs that we seek freedom love respect power friendship health fairness and justice. this movie is great because it can reach to any human being regardless of their background or history or preference it will touch you so deepthis movie can be put into so many words but heres just one...excellent. once again christopher nolan teams up with the wonderful christian bale with also some other new characters like the joker which is definitely the best villain i have ever witnessed in my life. heath ledger1978-2008 gives his best performance ever in this movie totally oscar worthy. harvey dent which is played wonderfully by aaron eckhart especially when he becomes two-face. and then we have maggie gyllenhaal who gives a terrific performance as bruce waynes love rachel dawes. please do go see this film you will be very glad you did.this movie by far is the best cult fiction movie ever made streamlined performance of samuel l jackson makes it a wonderful dark thriller of ages by far known as the era of amateur crime becoming professional in a way a must watch in any movies list before you die epic thriller of all time and the twists in plots with an ultimate climax takes the movie into the very next level a true entertainer of sorts with a great impact on the box office in those time it is one of the highly rated movies of all time and a well directed acted produced combination the in depth realisation of each character is another strong point of this film with major emphasis given on the lead actors the movie takes a good support from the female actors who helps in the building up of the story the supporting role are well organised and created intellectually the contribution from each department of the movie is prominent and locations of shooting and storyline settings are well taken care about the movie has won much appreciations and great audience support and is still a celebrated movie worldwide the movie can be guided into the record books as the very literature of film makingthis movie brings back lots of great memories so im biased anyway... nevertheless a lot of people feel the same way about this piece. im sure of that. the return of the king sums the trilogy up more than nicely. so well done. with lots of blood sweat and tears put into it. you feel it by watching it. lesnies cinematography is a perfect fit for the epic landscapes and the breathtaking visual effects. i have to mention that i never read the book but from a movie standpoint the story works just fine for me. and even to i may have overseen some goofs here and there it all makes sense in the end. for those that havent had the pleasure to watch it in cinemasi recommend getting the extended version dvd the one with all three movies included. the included making of is one of the best made behind the scenes looks out there.this movie blew me away one word to some it all up is refreshing thats what this movie was to me finally something different original but intelligent the way the story is told the dialogue the cast  everything was right on the money the movie is filed with classic scenes memorable quotes and unforgettable characters i recommend this film to everyone who wants to see something fresh beware you must open minded fallow the story but dont worry even if its told in a special way it isnt avant-garde to the point where its impossible to understand it i just hope that tarantino can come up with the magic again i was disappointed with jackie brown i cannot blame him not every movie could be masterpiecethis movie and the whole trilogy deserves all the praise it has received. i had been worried about seeing it because of how much peter jackson re-wrote two towers and presented scenes that undermined some of tolkiens fundamental ideas. this time jackson followed tolkien more closely and the worst that can be claimed are sins of omission. its a real shame we didnt get to see christopher lee in this movethis movie and indeed all the lord of the rings movies is the best that i have ever seen. in fact i wouldnt consider this a movie because generally when i watch a movie its just entertainment for me not something to be remembered and thought of long after ive watched it. this masterpiece of film-making this beautiful moving incredible conclusion to a trilogy which held me in amazement from the battle at the plains of gorgoroth to the ringbearers passing at the grey havens is perhaps the best adaptation of a book ever. if you are perhaps reading this comment having not seen the movies buy them and watch them now. the best way to watch them is not one after another quickly without time to reflect on each one but one evening after another with time to appreciate and understand tolkiens masterpiece. ive seen the comments on this movie few as they are which nearly all say that they loved the books and hated the movies giving various reasons as to why. ill give you a few examples. 1. the characters werent developed at all. im sorry the actors and actresses from the movies were all incredible doing what they were best at amazingly well. ian mckellen the actor who played gandalf does one of perhaps the best performances ive ever seen. elijah wood as frodo understands the effect the ring has on the hobbit and shows that knowledge to create a moving performance of an individual struggling against a power that is too great to bear. i could go on but its not necessary. every single character in that film is as well developed as anyone would be in real life. 2. the scouring of the shire was not shown. i can give a completely logical explanation for this. in the book near to the end of rotk frodo and sam destroy the ring and sauron and all evil is defeated. the hobbits weary of all their adventures and sorrows return home to find that saruman and wormtongue have taken over the shire and are forced to defeat them as well. now to me and most other people that have read the books this is seen as a huge anticlimax. think about it in movie form. the audience having watched an amazing three hours of film are now ready for the end. then suddenly saruman pops out of nowhere and has almost ruined the shire. in the books this is acceptable because it shows that evil can come to the most good of places. but this has already been shown many times in other parts of the book like lothlorien fangorn and ithilien to some extent. 3. too much cgi. i can answer this criticism fairly quickly. imagine if there was little or no cgi in the lord of the rings movies. all it would be would be close up shots of the actors and places with maybe a few actors in prosthetic makeup. this would never give the sense of scale necessary for the books. for the places and things tolkien describes you need cgi and i cannot see how anyone could possibly criticise that. 4. not true to the books so what any movie that you see that is based on a book is never and i repeat never completely and utterly true to the book. peter jackson took these masterpieces of literature and turned them into masterpieces of film-making and people who say they werent true to the books are sometimes right but the films must be seen as works of art in their own right. actually the love story between aragorn and arwen is used in the movies and fitted in perfectly with the rest whereas tolkien put this in the appendices. there arent other any major criticisms that i can find apart from petty things like they sucked and i walked out 30 minutes before the end. these comments are not worthy of argument mainly because they are made by people that probably have never seen the sun. sorry about that but it had to be said. still there are just some people who dont like fantasy and dont like these films. fine i can respect that. but really these films arent just fantasy. theyre a story that has enchanted generations a tale of war peace beauty good evil friendship hope fear and love that would work in any genre. i challenge any film-maker to surpass these films ever again and im sure that in fifty years these films will still be popular with people watching them in goggles in 3d blu-ray. just speculating anyway for me these films are incredible. nothing more to be said.this isnt just a fancy superhero movie...its beyond that. it deserves every amount of praise lavished onto it. putting aside the plot and the taking the performances of everyone involved in the movie are beyond excellence. christopher nolan is as usual at his best. nolan strikes with his non- linear storytelling in his own style. we will be blown with his sublime work. this is definitely the sequel we deserved. christian bale and heath ledger were phenomenal. the joker has made evil look so good... this is the first film i know where the joker who plays a negative role had such a positive impact on the film.this is without doubt my favourite film the acting casting soundtrack story and direction are in my opinion second to none it is violent and thats not why i enjoyed it so much although i can see why some would not like the film because of the excess of the violence but it is funny moving and had me on the edge of my seat throughout youve got to see it at least once maybe not as much as i have watched it possibly or you are missing outthis is without a doubt one of the finest films of the last 20 years. i think that if it had been released with more fanfare and didnt have such great competition that year it might have won for best picture. this film has such a powerful presence that it has a life of its own apart from the cast  cinematography etc. all of which are deservedly great. this is one of those movies that you can switch to when you are channel surfing and stop and watch the rest of it no matter what part of the movie you are at. perhaps the godfather and jaws are a couple of others that do that for me and it never gets old no matter how many times you watch it. one thing that disappoints me regarding this film is what has happened to the director frank darabont. unfortunately he has never come close to achieving the greatness of shawshank with his subsequent films. i thought the green mile was good but it didnt hold a candle to shawshank. i was also very disappointed in the mist. i sincerely hope that he is able to recapture some of the magic of shawshank redemption in a future film because he definitely does have the proved ability to do so.this is without a doubt one of my favorite films of all time ill never forget watching this film for the first time with a good buddy of mine afterward we couldnt stop talking about it and spent a great deal of time explaining plot points to each other we finally decided that we just had to see it again so we did and all of our questions were answered and our theories proven correct the story is nothing less than superb every time you think you have the movie figured out they throw you for another loop but not too much as to get you irritated trying to figure out the plot this is most definitely a film that deserves at least two viewings before you can truly understand and appreciate the story the characters are all excellent as well although i was sad to see jack harmen emilio estevez get killed off so quickly i liked his character the cast is extraordinary tom cruise plays ethan hunt perfectly jon voight was the perfect choice for jim phelps emmanuelle beart was very good in her role henry czerny was superb as kittridge jean reno was an excellent addition to the cast ving rhames was a very nice touch and really added a lot to the film kristin scott thomas was lovely as always although played a somewhat minor role in the greater scheme of things vanessa redgrave was another nice addition to the cast and finally emilio estevez as i mentioned above played a small role and played it quite well i can see why some of the big fans of the show wouldnt like this film due to certain plot points that i cant give away so if you are a big fan of the show be forewarned you may have some issues with the film personally ive never seen a single episode of the old television show so i had absolutely no frame of reference which i believe put me in a better position to appreciate the story i feel that i have to mention the action scenes in this film spectacular the scene where kittridge and hunt are talking in the restaurantjust awesome the entire last 20 minutes of the filmunbelievable the filming the action the special effects and stunts alone make this film worth watching but luckily there is so much more to appreciate if you are a fan of tom cruise or just crimemysteryaction films in general be sure to check this one out at least twice this is honestly one of my top 20 films of all time i truly hope that you will enjoy this film thanks for reading christhis is without a doubt my favorite movie. every time i see this movie i feel touched by its magic. most of my friends have seen it because i have recommended them to do it and they have all loved it. robbins freeman and whitmores characters are the ones that i like the most. it is just stupid unfair and shameful that this wonderful movie was not awarded neither at the oscars nor the golden globes. the imbd voters have it at #2. my hope is to see it in the future at #1.this is what im always looking for in a movie amazing and thoughtprovoking script finely detailed and imaginative cinematography and cgi inspired and believable acting and a soundtrack hans zimmer that connects viewers with the story adding tension passion soul scouring drama and pause through well crafted music unlike many science fiction movies interstellar goes the extra light year to bring home the themes of family loss unfathomable exploration and dimensions beyond our scope of reality leave everything at home and experience this tremendous work of art hell make it a holiday present to yourself and everyone you know i know there are a lot of excellent movies that will be released between now and the end of the year but this is an absolute must seethis is truly a masterpiece this is a movie based off a comic book but never was you felt like you are reading a comic book. the movie is so grounded in reality that make you feel like you are in this living world where batman himself can save you. there are many thing that make this movie great. batman he is a crime-fighting hero like any hero he is selfless. he endure pain for other people. he lives by day as a playboy but by night he swing justice to everyone. he is smart skillful selfless and terrifying. he is the dark knight. harvey dent he is a lawyer like any lawyer he bring justice to gotham. but deferent from batman he dont where mask he already fighting justice. he is smart talented charming and brave. he is the gotham white knight. the joker he is the villain of the story like any villain he bring chaos to the table. he break people and bring fear to them just like batman. he evil smart terrifying and manipulative. these three unique character bring different aspect to the movie. all three can not live without the other and all three are in constant conflict. batman need of harvey to be the face gotham deserve harvey need of batman to help him with his work the joker need both of them to make a point. this create a thicken plot packed with action crime drama make for a thrilling experience. this is the movie where people would look back 10-20 years from now and say its a classic. i could spend my hole week watching this movie and i can still find somethings new. if you have not seen this movie give it a shot you will now regret it.this is the second best scifi movie i have watched the first one i absolutely fell in love was the avatar oh i do love those movies the guardians of the galaxy has everything action drama humor it is simply worth watching the storyline is very interesting it is indeed great to watch the creation of someone who has put it on the screen i admire the way the actors play simply amazing i honestly was surprised that vin diesel was the voice of groot and actually after behind the scenes videos i discovered that lee pace is actually ronan amazing how sometimes you cannot even recognize some wonderful personalities really those who havent managed to see it  you must watch enjoy the moviethis is the only movie i would give 10 out of 10 for. this movie has got everything a movie needs: great acting and great actors an amazing storyline superb music a perfect movie length and a fantastic ending. this movie deserves all the credit it gets. it is my favourite movie of all time and always will be. this movie has changed my life.  while it doesnt have the innocence of reservoir dogs or the maneuverability of the kill bill series it definitely stands on its own. it is also one of the more charming and highly appealing of the generation x stoner flicks. let me just say that if i could give this movie beyonder points id give it a 16 for eerily supernatural. great great work. this is the greatest movie of all time. from the dialog to the story. has some of the greatest characters and some of the most emotional moments. has one of the greatest and most underrated soundtracks ever. there is a big reason this movie won 11 oscarsshould of won 12 for sean astins incredible performance and it should have been nominated for another for andy serkiss smeagol outstanding performance in the beginning scene of the return of the king. it has the best writing of all time and is just such an amazing movie. never gets old i have seen the movie 5 times just in the past year. peter jackson is a genius and j.r.r tolkien is a god. the characters are so amazing. aragorn: the most humble character who led an army to victory and helped middle earth be saved. his battle speech is one of my favorite speeches of all time and his line for frodo was epic. in the ending of the return of the king when he said to the hobbits you bow to no one was just so powerful and amazing. he is one of my favorite characters in this film for sure. gollum/smeagol: corrupted by the power of the ring and cant control it is amazing and his two separate personalities are different. that one scene in the very beginning of the return of the king was just awesome. when he kills his friend deagol for the ring. gandalf: one of the greatest characters ever. so amazing how he pretty much saved the whole of middle earth. you shall not pass was epic and how he came back to life to finish off his mission was amazing. merry/pippin: the lovable funny twins brought entertainment every time they were on screen. merrys stupidity is hilarious. how courageous such a small person can be was amazing samwise: my favorite character in any movie or bookother than severus snape. the greatest friend anyone can ever have. his amazing speech in two towers touched everyone. he should have won an oscar or at least been nominated. he is amazing in the return of the king when he is telling frodo about the shire and his sadness when frodo decides to keep the ring. when he saved frodo from the spider and from the tower in mordor was so epic. he is the friend everyone should have.this is the greatest film ive ever seen. american beauty and north by northwest come pretty close but then again i havent seen citizen kane yet. theres not much i can say about the film that wont give away something so ill just give it my unequivocal endorsement. close the blinds open your mind and watch this film preferably four or five times so everything becomes clearer.this is the great movie that i ever see in the batman movie series. although there are some parts which i never expect before. like at the end the movie indicate a new hero will come to this comic character on the next part. it was really exciting. though my opinion is solidifying already after having seen a warner bros. screening last night dark knight ably stands on its own with or without batman begins. at a two and a half hour runtime its definitely an epic of a movie but one that never runs out of gas. a delightful addition to this experience was a healthy amount of imax footage which significantly adds to the feel of being on a personal and gruesome tour of gotham city. christian bale plays such a well rounded batman and bruce wayne qualities that none of those who have donned the cowl before him have pulled off. i still have to remember that bale is british since he speaks with such a spot on american accent. bale has a particular slurring lisp that serves him quite well charmingly for bruce wayne and threateningly for batman. countering him is the late heath ledger who plays such a scary and creepy joker that i found it impossible to not have chills half the time i saw him on screen. what really separates this brand of joker from jack nicholsons portrayal is true unpredictability. its obvious that to be a good guy and think like the joker it really takes a toll and it sure isnt easy. how exactly does one take him down when hes woven his harebrained plot around multiple hostages explosives or disappearing parlor tricks initially i was uneasy about how the character of harvey dent would be handled. in my mind there was really only one faithful portrayal of him and that could be found in the batman animated series of the early 90s. as well as tommy lee jones could have handled him in batman forever he certainly did not though it still was a highlight of that movie. aaron eckhart ably assumes the mantle here delivering a performance out of this world easily on par with the batman animated series.this is the first time i am really wand to write something about this movie even though i have watched it a hundred times o so anyone who really wanna know how a movie should b should watch this one movies are medium which should make us think and this one surely does about life anyone wanna know the meaning of patience determination this one does the trick for u watch it and be inspired thats all i can say it will change the way u think about things around u never let it die in uthis is the first batman movie thats not about batman. its no traditional yarn about a protagonist fighting a villain with audiences hoping the hero beats the bad guy. on the contrary its a thrilling story about the cost of heroism and seduction by evil. tim burton explored anti-hero themes with michelle pfeiffers brooding catwoman in batman returns and although burton failed to flesh it out many people agree catwoman was the best part of that film. director christopher nolan knows better having demonstrated a hitchcockian mastery of psychology with themes of guilt insomnia and competition the prestige. in his film we meet joker a chilling heath ledger a sociopath with a taste for anarchy. he doesnt want revenge or power. in one scene he burns a mountain of cash. the mobsters call him crazy and before he cuts them to pieces he mutters its not about money. its about sending a message. right away we know he isnt a villain we can predict or understand. consequently hes pretty terrifying. ledgers joker is so compelling that he has the best lines and the most memorable scenes. usually we watch superhero films to see how the protagonist overcomes the villain. but in the dark knight we strangely cheer as the joker kicks ass at robbing banks manipulating the mob and even destroying a hospital. strangely enough we walk away from the experience not wanting to be batman. we want to be joker. but thats not what i mean when i say this movie isnt about batman. its actually about da harvey dent aaron eckhart whose strong performance will be overshadowed by ledgers. he is gothams white knight and his tragedy revolves around an anecdote told early in the film about the roman who guards his city not out of power lust but of civic duty-- to which his girlfriend and assistant da rachel dawes maggie gyllenhaal wisely refutes dont forget the last man given that duty was named caesar. here lies the central theme-- a man holds power until death or long enough to see himself become the villain. its deep stuff for a batman movie but it works extremely well. many may leave the film wondering why but it has to do with what we missed from star wars episode iii. although were horrified by jokers mind whose villainy rivals anthony hopkins hannibal lecter we cant help but be strangely drawn to his eerie confidence manic charisma and unstoppable power. due to some grueling and unexpected events dent falls from grace and becomes seduced by jokers evil. lets not forget batman who is common-denominator but not centerpiece to the war between dent and joker. dent proclaims batman as gothams hero but others dont agree-- including bruce wayne. wayne is still a jealous self-absorbed and emotionally tortured brat in many ways as we learned from batman begins. he doesnt see himself as a hero. and although he despises dent for stealing rachel away from him he deeply admires him. here we draw the dichotomy of white knight dent and dark knight batman. bruce wayne knows that he cant have rachel unless he gives up batman forever. but theres a pain within him that keeps him out at night fighting his personal demons. he loves rachel the same way dent loves rachel but he wont give up being batman. bruce wayne is not a noble self-sacrificing hero. he has his cake and wants to eat it too. equally dent wants to fight a hard line with crime. hes incorruptible unwilling to compromise doing it for principles of righteousness rather than personal glory. he too refuses to be a hero. but unlike batman he is self-sacrificing fighting in broad daylight in full vulnerability even if it puts him and his loved ones at risk. dont worry-- nolan never lets this character drama drag the story. the movie is wall-to-wall action with sensational stunt sequences that exceed any prior batman film primarily because it uses very few digital effects. its got a gritty organic feel of urban combat like michael manns heat which brought us into a downtown la war-zone where gunshots echo off the walls of buildings. as we witness a chase between an 18-wheeler and a swat truck we know its actually happening. many filmmakers neglect what steven spielberg calls geography and consequent quick-cutting and stylistic shots make the viewer lose their sense of setting. but nolan keeps things very real using helicopter shots and wide-angle lenses the way he did with prior films that depended on atmosphere insomnia the prestige. most people familiar with the comics know that dent becomes the villain two-face. but nolan makes a statement with dents transformation to evil. harvey dent succumbs to crime because his life has endured tragedy and everything hes stood for has fallen to pieces. meanwhile joker isnt so much a villain as a sardonic force of nature reminiscent of javier bardems anton chigurh in no country for old men. for most of the movie batman merely assists dent in his war on evil. but in the end batman takes the fall for two-faces crimes allowing dents legacy to live on. in this he truly becomes the dark knight because he allows the white knight to triumph. even though evil has apparently won the battle batman refuses to allow evil to win the war. i think many people write off superhero movies assuming they dont hold literary merit-- this was the case with burtons zany batman and joel schumachers cartoon-like batman. i hope the dark knight proves that such a belief is untrue. check out the original comics or the animated series and youll see theres a lot more being said with these characters. the joker is not funny like jack nicholson or cesar romero. hes scary. hes scarier because he doesnt take the world seriously. fortunately the film takes itself seriously and its one of the best in recent years.this is the film to define our generation tarantino has set a standard in movie making for the next 20 years pretty much like hitchcock did for his time this movie a real pleasure to watchthis is the best the dialog between actors was great absence of a single staring role was very appreciated all the character parts were diversify unique and all were developed appropriately every seen had an unexpected twist yet never leaving you confused or trying to lead the audience astray i was completely absorbed never finding a dull moment or having time to try and figure out what was coming next this is unequivocally the best movie of the decade i saw it twicethis is the best of the dark knight trilogy in my opinion. heath ledger is fantastic as the joker also i feel he kind of gets put in the back burner but aaron eckharts harvey dent/ two face is also fantastic and the special effects on his face are incredible. bale will always be my favourite batman and this story is brilliant especially the tension between the two boats at the end. kind of annoying they changed the actor of the rachel character only to have her go and get killed but thats only one small gripe in an otherwise perfect film. id also like to mention the fantastic opening sequence in the bank that has to be one of my favourite scenes in any film hopefully the second man of steel film will be as fantastic as this second dark knight moviethis is the best movie ive ever seen. it has everything  picture jumps round but in the same time gathers the plot in to one piece. pulp is cult. this is the best movie i have ever seen. in a way i feel i am in a prison of life myself. restricted to doing certain things. sometimes i get frustrated and feel as i should runaway to some place where i could feel free. i hope and dream for it sometime. this movie just reminds me of my feelings so much. i love andy dufresne most in this movie. although critics say tim robbins didnt do enough to express the character but my personal opinion is that he was made for this role. i can go on and say more but i said the most important thing which i feel whenever i watch it. i am glad to visit imdb. i never heard of it before. some 7 years ago i saw it at no.2 in the rankings and decided to watch it immediately. only other movie which even comes close to this is citizen kane. but that is about past and this one is about hope and freedom. i give it 11/10.this is the best movie i have ever seen how can you hate it the acting is stunning its silly the best i think is bale batman this movie is great batman gordon and dent fight to keep crime of the streets until the joker comes in and ruins every thing he slowly brings mayhem to gotham city all hope is gone can batman save the day while dent loses his sanity sadly heath ledger died before this movie could be done kind of overrated his performance but great this movie is the soul reason why im a batman fan i wish they sold the comics here oh well more reading wigs for me also good is morgan freeman as fox and aaron as dent so far my only good review go to my page to see my other reviewsthis is the best movie ever but i give you 15 things you may not have known about the shawshank redemption 1. its based on a novella by stephen king the film is based on stephen kings novella rita hayworth and shawshank redemption which was published in a short story collection called different seasons. two of the other short stories in the collection were made into films stand by me in 1986 and apt pupil in 1998. only one of them the breathing method has not been turned into a movie. 2. its similar to tolstoy kings novella shares several plot points with a nine-page short story by russian writer leo tolstoy called god sees the truth but waits. both are about men sent to prison for murders they didnt commit. 3. director frank darabont got a good deal on the rights to kings story he bought the rights from king for $1. 4. it almost had a much different cast castle rock entertainment the studio that made shawshank was co-founded by rob reiner_„îdirector of another king adaptation stand by me_„îand is named after the mythical maine town that provides the setting for many of kings books. after director frank darabont pitched shawshank to the studio reiner originally offered $2.5 million for the script to star tom cruise as andy dufresne and harrison ford as red. 5. the original title was changed to avoid confusion darabont wrote the script in eight weeks before pitching it to castle rock entertainment. he decided to drop the rita hayworth part of the novella because actresses sent their resumes in for consideration thinking it was a rita hayworth biopic. during the casting process darabont even received a call from an agent who represented a supermodelthis is the best batman movie out there. heath ledger as the joker was the perfect choice as he made joker almost real. he became the joker and i was so fascinated about his acting skills. such a shame he has past away r.i.p heath ledger. i love christian bale as batman he was a really great choice and i dont really care about how the voice is overrated as people say its really good anyway. the only thing i would have loved was more scarecrow in the movie. even in the dark knight rises and in batman begins i wanted more scarecrow because cillian murphy is such a brilliant actor as scarecrow. this is my favorite movie. everyone should have seen it once at least. in my case ive seen it over 30 times.this is the batman movie i waited my entire life to see adam west the animated series and maybe michael keatons batman were decent but this film is on another level of awesome - and i mean it when i ask why it took so long for someone to do the batman franchise a solid favor. the characters portrayed by christian bale michael caine heath ledger gary oldman aaron eckhart maggie gyllenhaal morgan freeman and the music of hans zimmer really come together for swell time for a batman fan. another aspect i enjoy is the city-scape of chicago throughout the film. as a person from the midwest that kind of sweetens the deal.this is tarantinos best film and i think that bruce willis is excellent  john travolta and bruce willis are doing all the work and the result is superb  this film is brilliant this is such a good movie that even to this day many years after it came out i still cannot find a single person who does not like shawshank redemption. everything in this film is timed well. the story is excellent and flows with perfect timing and the editing between the sequences are great. the acting is great and it keeps you interested from the first to the last frame. it also has a very clever plot. you are not 100% sure what tim robbins is up to and how he has escaped until much later. great job by everyone from director actors to script. just the best in movie making.this is really a great movie i loved this movie and it doesnt get all it is a classic and and from my point of view the the best tarantino movie this was made for all movie lovers an extraordinary visual adventure for the spectator the acting is really good and the casting is amazing there you have the two mob killers vincent vega and jules winnfield the duo john travolta and samuel l jackson was the best ive ever seen then you have the boxer: buuuutsch bruce willis there is also the wolf not the one from wall street played by the wonderful hrvey keitel there is also the the extraordinary wife uma thruman brings it to another one as mia wallace the screenplay is really interesting because it involves three parallel stories told to the spectator through different chapters sometimes you have movies known for the one big scene but in this case it is impossible to only take one two or three scenes the whole movie is a classic and a must-see before dyingthis is one of those movies where after the it ends you will say that was 2 hours well spent action begins from the go and it is very realistic or at least they have made it look realistic on the screen unlike some other similar movies there is no flying or gravity defying moves here its more of a close combat and that really intrigued me precision perfect stunts and amazing cinematography with a touch of humor will definitely make you come alive the characters in the movie are really appealing a notable candidate would be the super villain calmhumorous and villainous all at the same time loved his character even though the movie is action packed it comes with a good story a very good one in fact so the bottom line is this is a great movie and worth your time this is one of those movies that you will end up watching again after a while and forget just how good it is i think they should start playing more reruns on the tv as far as the plot its a batman movie. if youve seen one you know what is going on. i think the main reason i enjoy this trilogy more than the others is because it seems to be darker grittier than the others if that makes sense.. the movie keeps you on the edge of your seat right from the beginning. i like all of the movies from this trilogy if i had to choose i would pick this one as the best although ... i will change my mind on occasion they are all really good. if you are looking for must watch movies i dont think you could go wrong with this. if you like it i suggest the rest i include this movie when suggesting movies to my friends all the time. enjoy p.s. - dont forget the popcornthis is one of those movies that you just have to see to believe. the only flaw is that the plot is a bit confusing at first to some viewers but will soon be figured out. some parts are almost like a mystery movie. first i have to explain the joker in the dark knight but im not sure which words to use. ledger played the part like hed been the character all his life and there wasnt a single part that i doubted he was the joker. seriously his words came so easily and everything about the character was done brilliantly. as for batman/bruce wayne the dark voice bale voiced the character with suited him perfectly and once again we see yet another perfect example of flawless acting. the karate the strength the intelligence even... it was all there he also looked just like bruce wayne should have. everyone did an amazing job and the make-up for two-face was stunning. like seriously it was so freaky and cool. this is a good movie. if you like lots of violence and comic book characters. believe me. it was spectacular.  about continuity in a lifetime based on friendship and hope. this is one of those films that come once in a blue moon. the ones that leave you sitting on your seat staring at the screen when the film is ended and trying to think of a word to describe the excellence of the film although shawshank does take a while to get started but you understand why later on the film. the characters need to be explained for you to understand later points in the film. what really makes this film great is the use of no special effects no stunts just plain simple amazingly originalwitty story writing and outstanding acting by every character in the film including the minor ones. just based in a prison men talking to each other. this film does make you feel involved in the film. you feel every characters emotions and pain and share their joy and happiness. when the film ends it takes you 10 seconds to get back to reality again - its just that compelling best personal film of all time and best film on imdb and rightly so spectacular film   however it is a requirement that the dialogues are made to be easier to understand rather than being kept in the original tolkien style since you cannot re-see a scene like when you can re-read a part of the book if you did not understand. the choice of actors are undoubtedly most suitable while the costume and prosthetics are as realistic as it gets. howard shore was great and words could not describe the sensations that flow out of each of his pieces. i do not understand why some people actually accuse the film of being terrible in any aspect. the length of the film is a necessity in order to be able to portray the depth of the story and do justice to tolkiens masterpiece. if it was to be any shorter then the film would be missing essential elements required to bring out the majesty of middle-earth. it is simply unfair to say that and this is missing therefore it is not worth watching because if jackson was to include everything each of the trilogy would be over 10 hours long assuming it took everyone that long to read. i for one will not be sitting in a chair for 10 hours and i believe it will also be unpractical to produce a movie that is 10 hours long. it follows that there will be minor discrepancies in the plot but it did not deter the storyline keeping in mind that this is an adaptation. despite some criticism of this film being overrated i believe that it deserves to be ranked as one of the best films ever produced and its grandeur unmatched. overall this is a very enchanting film that is worth watching especially for fans of the lord of the rings. the extended edition is also a personal recommendation as it includes some missing elements that were not necessary for the progression of the plot but adds nicely to the storyline. this is one of the movies of all time. theres action beyond belief and humor that breaks down the tension that really works. there also enough emotion to round out the experience. the joker is one of the best characters of all time. hes truly amazing. r.i.p mr. heath ledger. christian bale is of course one of the best actors ever. its truly a gift to watch them on screen. see this movie it will make you a better person. the ending is perfect and amazing. every time i watch it pick up something new. there was a lot of effort put into this. better than batman begins but not as good as inception. its actually surprisingly under rated.this is one of the most amazing movies ive ever watched. it is based on a steven king book which makes the plot not predictable. the story twists and turns while during the movie it seems that it is heading on a straight path forward. it tells the story of a banker which is accused of murdering his wife and her lover. he is sentenced to life in prison and placed in the shawshank prison where he meets a group of inmates which become his close friends during the decades he spends in prison. the movie tells the story of his life and struggles in the prison environment. any addition to the abstract will spoil the experience and perhaps be a spoiler. the amazing casting of both morgan freeman and tim robbins is amazing and couldnt be more accurate. i remember the first time i saw this movie many more viewing after that the movie just dont get old i was engulfed in it for the whole duration. a must-see movie for anyone and everyone.this is one of the greatest films i have ever seen. it has everything the battle scenes are wonderful especially and since the first hour is drama the action really gets to you and you feel like youre really there that is terrified. you care about the characters more than anything in this film so its scary watching a battle scene for the first time because its extremely unpredictable and you dont want your characters to die a few of them do. however the battle scenes are also very well done with a great mix of live-action and cgi. although this is a pg-13 film jackson really went over the limit with his battles  he totally rocked in the previous films. telling us to wait for the extended version isnt right. maybe jackson should have foregone one of the too many endings in rotk to give lee some film time. that said all the elements that worked in the previous movies were absolutely glorious in this film. the one new thing that i would add to so much that has already been written is that big kudos must go to the great tolkien artists alan lee and john howe whose artistry shaped so much of the imagery from the first moments of fotr to the final scenes of rotk. this historic trilogy would not have been the same without them. the lotr enterprise has clearly been a great labor of love from all who worked on it over the years and this final installment was a crowning achievement. this is one of the best movies about friendship ive ever seen also one of the best prison movies. i found it better than robert redfords castle. morgan freeman was perfect as usual and i can say that tim robbins reached the top of his performance and also his career. i wish this couple come together for another movie the kind of it is not important im sure the spectators will have the same taste as before. i watched most of the films of morgan freeman and i can say this was the best of his normally he prefers to play in films like sevenkiss the girlsalong came a spider... but i think he should think again that which kind of his films stay at the top of the charts...  all the other glitches are just that. if only you had given us tolkiens rendition here. this is one of the best ive watched the movie trilogy. i dont see tdk just as a superhero comic book movie because screenplay was written in a perfect way. created by nolan batsuit-mobile perfect design. the most beautiful thing in the film to return to the jokers and ledger as the joker was created to be such an amazing acting. when good and evil sits down to have a talk like an interrogation scene everyone in the audience shuts up and listens to what they have to say. thats i think this movie is great. i just did not like the actor who portray the character of rachel dawes. other than that nolan and his team did a great job. they can make 100 movies but we will feel its something missing perfect acting one of the best actors of all time nobody can be better than ledger as the joker.this is one of the best batman movies that i have ever seen. i believe that they did a great job. i love dc and this movie was able to remind me why that was. because there are all kind of superheroes. there is only one batman. when you are able to that this role on to the fullest and truly be come the bat.that is when you can make some thing good in to something great. there are a many other good twist and turns. they will live you in shock.the bat will face challenges. some will make him strong and other will leave him almost broken. in these without the joker it would be so lame. he bring the hummer. why so serious batman has all that anyone needs. he with be the catalyst for the whole movie. i have never seen someone out side of the batman cartoon be this go as a joker. when you watch this movie it fell like the joker is real. when you bring to people together that can become the bat and joker that is when you have made as a batman movie this was a once in a life time movie i dont know if anyone could ever be a better joker. if you dont believe what im saying then you need to watch it for your self. the you will understand why i think batman is so great for your self. to me the dark knight should prove one thing to all people. six words only there must always be a batmon.this is one of or maybe the best movie of the century it is so unique when it comes to jumping from different places to different times no other director than quentin tarantino could have made this movie so special just take a look at lets say reservoir dogs here he use the same teqnique but in a totally different way he is very aware of his one directing tarantino and he seems like a very intelligent person therefore i say that pulp fiction is a movie that indeed deserves 10 starsthis is one of my favorite movies.i love the acting and characters.i think it is intense and suspenseful.i think it has one of the best versions of the joker.i like how it deals with the corruption of the police force.my favorite part is when batman interrogated joker.i think it was unique that batman could not save rachelsince usually the hero saves someone that has been kidnapped.i liked harvey going bad because it shows that even really good people can turn.i dont blame it on the joker though because harvey was a little bad when he interrogated the guy in the chair.people in internal affairs also called him harvey two-face implying he had a darker side. i would recommend this movie to any batman or drama fan.this is one of my favorite movies of all time. my favorite parts are the characters of sam jackson and john travolta jules winfield and vincent vega. quentin tarantino did a fantastic job. other movies have tried to compare but none will. my good friend out in los angeles is an actor and he and his scene partner acted out the scene of jules and vincent driving around town and having a discussion about vincents recent travels abroad. and the writing was just amazing how the writer tied everything together so perfectly. and i think that its the dialogue that drives the movie and makes it such high quality. everything from the gold watch speech to harvey keitels dialogue. quentin always seems to find a way to make the something horrific quite humorous without ever seeming to ask for a laugh. he combines utilitarian prose with flights of rough poetry and a wicked fancy.this is one of my all-time favorite movies the subtle details of this move amaze me every time i watch it my only problem is getting friends to watch the movie that havent seen it during the whole movie i sit there watch this part as they are talking amongst themselves then at the end of the movie it doesnt make sense to them this is a great movie and i thank quentin tarantino for making it the way he did there is nothing about this movie that i would change i just wish i could make everyone sit down and pay close attention so they also could appreciate this movie the way i and all the other voters do thanksthis is on of my favorite movies of all times not to mention that quentin tarantino is probable one of my favorite directors on top of it but this movie is just one more prime example of why that is the performances of john travolta and samuel l jackson are riveting to watch and leave the viewer wanting more let us not forget the cameo performance either wonderful job to quentin for pulling of yet another stunning performance on the big screen the screen write is unprecedented to anything that has been released until now and has set the bar for future films to come if you are looking for a film of the decade you have found it this is definitely a film to last through the timesthis is not only a great comic book movie not only a great crime thriller movie but one of the best movies of all time. the best villain in all of dc comics the joker comes to life as he is portrayed by heath ledger who literally gave the performance of his life as he tragically passed away before the films release. bale is fantastic once again as batman returning with that epic voice and giving the fans once of the best movie quotes ever im not wearing hockey pads. the tone for this movie is dark and really gritty and takes nearly all the comic book elements and throws them out the window making this an epic movie for anyone to enjoy not just comic book fans. the soundtrack cinematography and direction for this movie is amazing just go an watch it if you havent already. 10/10this is my favorite movie of all time i was 15 when i first saw this at that time i didnt think movies could get any better than true lies pulp fiction changed that for me it set me on my quest to get a better knowledge of film from then on i wanted to see films that had a good plot and that showcased good acting it made me want to see good films ive said goodbye to those pathetic action and comedy movies i began to see the films of bergman scorsese deniro kubrick altman the list goes on and on 10 out of 10this is my 1st review on imdb  i dont like writing reviews for a movie after all its just a movie.....you see a movie and you forget... 95% of the movies you see and you forget soon well this movie really moves you and some of it remains with you ....gives you a great deal of idea how the real world is... each time you see it you feel light and get a feeling of satisfaction .... and more over if you like morgan free-man youll love of him after this one.... great movie... used to wonder why is it so highly rated.... well after seeing it.... i dont want to let the rating fall so i added mine and given it what it deserves...and i hope it remains at the top... i would like to thank the film maker and the production as a fan for a wonderful experience i got after seeing this movie :this is indeed the best movie i have ever seen i dont know how people actually hate it its a totally original movie its got everything from violence to extreme profanity this in my opinion gets a 10/10 for surethis is hands down the best movie i have ever seen quentin tarantino did such a good job i dont see how sam jackson didnt win the best supporting actor award the only thing this movie needs is robert de niro and they got it all this is such a good moviethis is for sure not the movie you can just leave behind in the theaters it is a must to have this in your movie collection. and like any true trilogy this movie is not the same if you have not seen the previous two installments. if you grew up and always loved batman and marvel movies and comics this one will not disappoint you. it is great to see all the characters come back and look and act even that much more fitting then you remembered them. christian bale played an extraordinary batman and i might say he could be one of the best actors to play batman. in my eyes this is an exceptional superhero movie it is masterful filmmaking by any standard.this is filmmaking at its apex though i would hardly argue that this film is the greatest which is what many imdb users relate after theyve just seen a movie they really like and then forget about once the next titanic or matrix hype machine bursts their way i must say that pulp fiction added more to the cinematic lexicon more than any other film of the 90s and who can argue with that indeed it is one of my favorites just for its adamant refusal to do things by-the-book and many previous comments essay this film as a highly moral and spiritual piece--they couldnt be more right when the film came out a lot of the reviewers commented on its cinematic brand of hipnessbeing hip is cool but i wouldnt necessarily equate that with great movies--just look at men in black which was sorta fun but hardly the endurable piece of cinema that pulp fiction has become so what sets it apart from the rest of the crowd its exactly this spiritualitywatching the film i remember being shocked and enlightened at the same time being unbearably tensed up and utterly charmed and in agreement with this weird california former video clerks world view the film is a tour-de-force of the cinematic style  one of my favorite shots in the film seems to be a homage to both the fast-paced unbreaking style of scorseses goodfellas and roman polanskis rosemarys baby it is the scene where travolta crashes his malibu into eric stoltzs front yard and brings the oded thurman inside his house as rosanna arquette hurls invectives at the two the camera wonderful work by andrez sekula moves back and forth between arquette and travolta and stoltz lurching over thurman thats the scorsese part then as stoltz goes looking for the plunger the camera follows him into a room where it inexplicably stops at the doorway so as to impede a full sight of stoltz reminders of the scene where polanski photographed ruth gordon in rosemarys baby by placing an obstruction between her and the camera so the audience would instinctively lurch their head to the side making a hopeless attempt to see around the obstruction such a phrase can be used to describe pulp fiction: most movies simply unfurl their stories at the audience this movie subliminally makes you a part of the action i recently had a semi-argument with a friend over the worth of this film over natural born killers now dont get me wrong oliver stone is a powerful filmmaker but his film banged you over the head incessantly with points like im going to use my artistic license to satirize the over-the-top violence of popular culture by making a movie replete withover-the-top violence in the style of david spade its called hypocrisy oliver--check into it anyways i digress anybody who bad-mouths this movie indeed has no appreciation for cinema  sure the film may have a goof or an errant philosophy somewhere  but tarantino fulfilled any filmmakers dream in revitalizing cinema you can say that the films tone didnt impress you that its style wasnt to your tastebut you cant deny the artistry that went into it morality for all of those who believe this film is an amoral travesty i suggest you rent the family favorite the santa clause and count how many times disney shamelessly milks its own products or if god is mentioned even once in what is supposed to be a christmas film or in any family film what impressed me the most when i first saw pulp fiction was its inclusion of god at all many generation-x filmmakers paging kevin smith are so agnostic in their beliefs that it was so refreshing to see one that painted divinity in such a positive light you can have those other indie favorites chasing amy and good will huntingboth starring those irritating crybabies matt damon and ben affleck and if you like those cynical films which are basically reworkings of oh-feel-sorry-for-me melodramas of the late-40s reworked with equally irritating alternative rock best summed up by the smashing pumpkins in a simpsons episode: alls we got is our millions of dollars our legions of fans and our youth then you can have them compare that to jules awakening i was just sitting here eating my muffin and drinking my coffee when i had what alcoholics refer to as a moment of clarity and youll see how tarantino turned the mythic gen-x stereotype on its head as well pulp fiction is in my opinion the king of the indies and one of the best examples of cinematic craftsmanship everthis is definitely the best film of the 90s closely followed by seven and fight club tarantino breaks the molds of the gangster film and gives a great and at many time comedic look into the lives of two hit men bruce willis also gives his best performance ever mostly because he doesnt say much in the film the music is just perfect as with almost all of tarantinos films if you havent watch this film watch it right now i think for me at least the most drawn out part of the film is vinces interactions with mia mostly because i find myself partial to sam jackson anyways this film is a great go watch it then watch it again then ask yourself what does marsellus wallace look likethis is definitely one of my favorite movies -- it makes me cry and laugh and ache inside all at once. tim robbins you make my days a little brighter -- thank youthis is by far the greatest movie i have ever seen. christopher nolan reached new heights and created a masterpiece. let me start with the acting. heath ledger is one of the most underrated actors ever. he fit the role of the joker much better than his previous actor jack nicholson. every word he said was more insane than the word before it. his list of famous quotes stretches more than 100 yards long. he is scary mischievous and downright psychotic. his crazy schemes almost always come together and they they push their victims to the limits. christian bale also performed extremely well but not as well as ledger. he was a great bruce wayne and his part was terrifically written. aaron eckhart and gary oldman also performed extremely well and their characters helped make the movie what it is: amazing. the suspense in this movie pushes you to the edge of your patience and when it finally pays off oh boy is it good i can barely find anything wrong with this movie. it is nearly flawless.this is by far the best of the 3 sequels. i personally feel this has got to be the best movie of 2003. it is a must see. the fight scenes and the acting have truly culminated into one of the best cinema experiences i have ever experienced.this is beyond doubt my favourite movie of all-time. i am a morgan freeman fan and apart from driving miss daisy i have loved all his movies that i have seen. the shawshank redemption stands above all. i think it is a great movie with a sad overall story but a happy and just ending. the only other prison movie i like as much is the classic clint eastwood movie escape from alcatraz. the shawshank redemption has long been my favourite movie and even though i have the dvd i still watch when it is on tv. 15 years since its release and i still havent seen anything i like more. i would recommend this movie to everyone and if you havent seen it yet you must be living in a cave or something. if you are in a cave get out and go see this fantastic movie. 10/10this is an awesome movie that has crime thrill and comedy you wont be bored even for a single minute in this 154 minute movie as the story is very interesting and entertaining the story line is written in such a way that it prevents you to get out of your seat at any point of time the four stories blend themselves in a very beautiful way that you have might have never seen before everyone did superb acting in the movie especially john travolta and bruce willis quentin tarantino has put in some ultimate dialogues in this movie that make the movie special 10 on 10 for this superb movie must watch for allthis is an amazing film let me get that out of the way first there is no doubt about it the cast list alone is impressive samuel l jackson john travolta bruce willis and many other top celebrities along with walk on parts for steve buscimi and even quentin tarantino himself the overall plot of pulp fiction could be quite hard to follow as it isnt set out chronologically but you will figure out whats happening when eventually ive watched this film around 5 or 6 times and every time i watch it i notice something new the first time i watched it i thought it was more of a crime action/thriller but you will soon realise that it can be classed quite easily as a comedy alot of the jokes are well hidden and there are a few in-jokes but anyone on this website will probably get them one point though this film is not for the faint hearted there are some scenes of violence and general not being nice one scene in particular which i seriously hope you wouldnt want to see i wont say any more but yuckthis is an amazing film it keeps you on your toes from the start all the way until the end i would suggest it for anyone to watch although its 2 and a half hours long not once was i bored i would suggest this film to anyone it really is amazing its amazing gripping thrilling and highly intelligent it has a superb twist and you never expect what happens this film is exciting and im so glad i got to see it for once id also suggest watching the trailer as it doesnt ruin the film although most of them do i would happily watch this film over and over as its surprising but yet it is still interestingthis is a very very very great film. its my all time favorite. first of all the acting is f**king great. my favorite actor in the entire film is easily morgan freeman. he should have won that oscar the fact that he didnt is a f**king disgrace. now the music to this movie is not to memorable but is still great and sets the mood for the film. now the story line is brilliant. andy dufresne is accused of the murder of the wife and her secret lover so he is sentenced to shawshank state prison. there he develops a friendship with a prisoner named red. the sets in this movie are great. as expected. so in the end this is a great movie and you should really check it out.this is a very dark movie and heath ledgers joker is the darkest it gets. the entire movie is like an eerie roller coaster ride. theres not much cgi here only a truly haunting  and dashes of the jokers mesmerizing lines. the action is kept from being overblown and thats really encouraging in this era of mindless cgi-driven summer blockbusters. more importantly the story of bruce wayne is taken to new high or low. this is unlike any comic book movie you have ever seen one that youll keep coming back to. all of the actors deserve their kudos but ledger overshadows them all.this is a superb film in all possible ways the acting is astonishing the camera work sublime and the  is fantastic this is the best work travolta has ever done and even bruce willis gives a great performance a stellar supporting cast includes tim roth amanda plummer and eric stoltz in the famous needle scene rent this i guarantee you will not be disappointedthis is a must watch movie in every once lifelove it.. the reviews which are ahead are as good as the movie... every frame in the movie has its meaning. one can think easily that even though movie came on to the screen two decades earlier it is still no:1 in its position i personally created this account to give my rating and write a review on such a wonderful film. i felt very happy after watching this film and i thought of sharing with you. finally i want to say that entertainment is there ever corner of our life. but meaning of the true life lies with in this movie. this movie give a valuable message if we want a thing really & actually from the heart then every force on this earth will try to help us..but the only thing we have to do is never loose hopethis is a movie for anyone who loves science fiction the film had a long playtime but after ive seen the movie i understood why its a galactic experience with such detail and sense of a space simulator did you find movie gravity was cool so is this movie light years better it has a style similar to 2001 a space odyssey but everything in this movie has so much more to effort this isnt an adventure its more like an explosion of details and experiences through a drama perspective it has it all for the fanatical science fiction nerd to thrive and the movie does that to the maximum an excellent moviethis is a masterpiece that words cant describe.in my opinion and many others this is the best movie if not ever at least of the 21st century no doubt. heath ledger was so so so awesomewho could ever thought that he could be the joker and not only be but playing it in the best way possible.c.bale is my favorite batman of all time and aaron eckhart was pretty good too. here has a 9.0 rating which in my opinion is not enough it should have had at least 9.5 but hey after all it has 1.2 million voters and 47.5% gave it a 10. this movie is epic is just so good i will never understand those who hate on this movie but this movie is so good and the best one out there.if you havent seen the movie go see it now you have no idea what youre missing even though i dont think there are many humans that havent watch this movie. i would say i give it a 10 but it seems so little for this movie so i give it 11/10.this is a masterpiece tarantino changed cinema forever when he created these characters it is not one individual effort that makes this film what it is however from the sublime direction to the quick witted script that keeps you on your toes throughout to the phenomenal and underrated performances by john travolta and uma thurman pulp fiction is perfection i went into this film with high expectations i had recently been introuduced to tarantino through his previous feature reservoir dogs which was also very good and so was anxious to see how he would handle a bigger production with a bigger budget and some of hollywoods best willis jackson travolta but there was no need to be as i was delivered a masterclass in film a very simple premise of two mob men dispatched on a daily round evolves into something much more and the with regards to the mystery of the contents of the briefcase a risky move by tarantino but it ultimately paid off as people still speculate to this day about it my belief is it contained his soul the way in which tarantino takes these apparently different stories and mixes them together to create some truly spectacular scenes is applaudable to say the leastthis is a great movie. being the second movie in the dark knight trilogy this is definitely the best. yes it can be disturbing at certain times but once you get past the violence and the dark undertone its a great movie that anyone above the age of 11 can enjoy. also the actors in this movie are amazing heath ledger plays a great joker and even has the laugh down. he is by far the best portrayal of the joker. also christian bale is the best portrayal of batman that i have seen and im sure that many fans would agree. he has the voice the looks and the acting skills to pull off the most bad ass superhero of all time.this is a film that demands your viewing visually emotionally and mentally do not let that scare you let it entice you and draw upon your wonder of the unknown and the curiosity of discovery i suggest you see this film with someone whether that be a friend family or significant other prepare for a few tears a few laughs and prepare to be baffled and mesmerized this is a film that pushes many limits and some might say the limits of its audience but i see that as a positive this film will remind you of 2001 the tree of life apollo 13 and insomnia for those looking for the link to christopher nolans other work insomnia is your best bet this carries all of the same acting writing and directing marvels of that film dark knight fans may be shied away and fans looking for the action of inception may leave feeling cheated but ignore them this is a film for people it is a personal and human film its most tender moments will cause views to draw on emotions and relationships in their own life it reaches beyond the screen asking some very personal as well as philosophical questions the film in the end may not have all the answers or even explain itself completely but is does not suffer from these aspects but rises higher because of them the movie is not perfect but it is not supposed to be perfect just like the first maps drawn or the first exploration into unknown waters there will be missteps and wrong turns i am keeping this short to avoid giving anything away go see this film with an open mind and it will reward you in every way it is a giant step forward in modern cinema it is a film that will be discussed for years to come and it is a film that has the power to affect the viewer something not many films in todays market can boast i cannot remember the last time a movie truly left me speechless there have been films i have wanted to watch again right away films i needed to process or films that had me deep in thought this film not only achieved all of the above but truly and honestly left me speechless the film will demand a great deal of the viewer including the three hour runtime but like any great adventure the reward at the end is greater than the sum of its partsthis is a cinematic masterpiece it is nothing short of brilliant and an incredible contribution to international cinema it contains arguably the funniest and wittiest dialogue ever in a film everybody in the world should see this movie no matter what age 5 starsthis has got to be one of my favourite films of all time. i first saw it when it made it to british tv and have only just got round to buying it and ive watched it a few times since then. the characters have so much depth you end up loving them the more you watch this film. the acting is first class. the cinematography is first class. the sound is first class. the casting is first class. the dialogue is fantastic. all these elements and more make this a riveting watch and you end up wishing the film could be longer. this is one of the few times ive seen a film after reading the book thinking the film is an improvement. it seems to me it expands a little on stephen kings novella. this film deserves the rating it has here on imdbthis film was absolutely amazing. i have spent hours re-watching various scenes and noticing all the perfection with which they are acted and directed.i like it.i watched this film since 2009.but it is in the my mind still.the acted and special effects are very good. i think orlando bloom is the best actor in the film.because i love archery. i like legolas.he killed two elephants with one arrow.he is very good archer. sarumans army are very strong.the goods is weaker than sarumans army.but goods are win every time.so the goods win the war with aragorns strong. this film very good.really i recommend watch this film to you. this film to do who thanks.this film ranks second among my all time favourites. the only reason it does not hold that coveted first place spot is that i am obsessed with monty pythons the holy grail. shawshank is a beautifully crafted film with one of the best endings i have ever seenthis film or may be masterpiece changed the whole outlook of mine towards life. the characters played by morgan freeman and tim robbins were so real and so closed to my heart that i cried and i laughed with them while watching it for the first time. we learn from books we learn from our parents we learn from our friends and we learn from movie like the shawshank redemption.once upon a time i was going through a bad phase of my life and bit depressed also. then some suggested me to watch this. what happened next was simply miracle. the pain endured by tim robbins was no less than mine. but it was hope that kept him alive. that infused a new joy in my life and i achieved success in very little amount of time. the dialogues are simply straight yet touching. the movie has universal appeal - it can move anyone because characters played by freeman and robbins are so close to heart. double thumbs up to stephen king and frank darabont for teaming up and offering this life changing piece of cinema. this movie was not made for oscars although it grabbed multiple nominations and not for critics some critics ridicule about its number position in imdb 250. it was made for common people like us. humble salute to all who were directly or indirectly associated with this all time classic.this film manages to redeem hollywood in the eyes of people who feared it long lost in a dark sea of clichÍ©s and predictability. darabont shows us that artists still work in the hollywood studios and production facilities. these artists show their capability to produce artthis film is the best film ever made. this is because it concludes an epic story which is full of complex characters and amazing scenes.each has a different quest and most get tied up at the end of the film. in addition this film have various epic moments which hold the pure essence of film making and great story telling and this film is full of emotion which will attach to the viewer while they watch it. lastly this film has no points which get boring or uninteresting. therefore every second of this film is epic due to its detailed battle scenes and complex character relations like frodo and sam which give warm emotion and courage to the film.this film is sweeping and epic yet never manages to lose its human touch. it has a message for each and every one of us and is as varied and personal as the many faces of middle earth. if you take nothing from this film other than this you will be the richer: this is an important a vital film because it has something to teach everyone and we are all the better for it.this film is really an amazing movie timeless. one of my all time favorites. about the long-can write something in a movie. masters said everything i needed there is not yet aware of the movie and i watched it for people to watch i would like to invite. than you. shawshank redemption is a very moving story about hope and the power of friendship. the cast is first rate with everyone giving a great performance. tim robbins and morgan freeman carry the movie but bob gunton and clancy brown are perfect as the warden norton and prison guard captain hadley respectively. and james whitmores portrayal of an elderly inmate brooks is moving. the screenplay gives almost every actor at least one or more memorable lines through out the film. as well as a very surprising twist near the end that almost knocked me out of my chair. if you have not seen this movie rent it or better yet buy it. as i bet youll want to see this one more than once.this film is pure class. i do not want to give anything away but heath ledgers performance in this is the best performance i have ever seen in my lifetime. shame it overshadows gary oldmans amazing performance as well. every aspect of this film is amazing the ideas the performances and the screenplay i remember coming out of the cinema in pure shock of how good this movie is. need to watch. incredible. christopher nolan is a geniusthis film is phenomenal easily top 5 or even the best film of all time it is rare for me to feel happy while watching a film but when i watch this movie i feel happy i listen to every word and feel completely immersed in every thing that is happening it is shocking that this film only won one oscar very frustrating to even think about it but most people seem to agree this is much better than forrest gump i feel myself hating that movie for these reasons samuel l jackson should have won an oscar his performance is incredible i hang on every word he says he also has a lot of memorable lines the characters in this film act so well together that it doesnt even seem like their acting but are instead meaning it the soundtrack couldnt have been any better it is perfect tarantinos talent is displayed in full view here at the top of his abilities this film is not serious it is more relaxed and entertaining but done so well you take it seriously if that makes sense i rarely have strong feelings for most films but this film is different than most films different in way that is more well done than most films that go by the rules/guidelines this film is tied with the good the bad and the ugly for the best film of all time no film will ever be like pulp fiction ever again unless they copy it that says a lot id recommend this film to anyone everybody needs to see this film it is the best of tarantinos masterpieces i cant believe people cry about this films success 1 star ratings by people that cant handle this filmthis film is perfect from the begining to the end in my humble opioion this is one of thoes films which only come along every so often and totally amaze peopleothers being usual suspectsshawshank and the godfather. i think the greatness of this film lies in the way it makes you think the way it intertwines a few stories into one and also by the amazing cast i dont want to bore you by going on for too long about this filmeven though i could go on for some time ill simply advise you to watch this film because once you have youll never look back 10/10this film is just too good for words to describe go and see this spectacle it will blow anyone away im not the biggest fan of fantasy adventures but this has blown me away and what an ending for the the brilliant trilogy. return of the king is better than the other two lotr films in my opinion but all three films are a joy to watch over and over again cant praise peter jackson enough as i said earlier on he created a peace of film making which is too good for words to describe and everyone should go witness this spectaclethis film is brilliant just brilliant. i watched this film expecting just a normal movie but when it ended i knew it would stay with me forever. every decade has one or two groundbreaking movies the 70s had the godfather and apocalypse now the 80s had platoon and raging bull the 90s had the shawshank redemption and pulp fiction and the 2000s had gladiator and the lord of the rings. there were a lot of good films in the 90s and this is up there with the best . the story is about a man called andy dufresne tim robbins who is wrongly convicted and sent to the shawshank prison. when there he meets red morgan freeman and then the story takes off. the acting is incredible and freeman and robbins deliver the performances of their career the script is incredible another great collaboration between steven king and frank darabont and it didnt win one single oscar this could have been good enough for three oscars at the least true the competition forrest gump and pulp fiction were good films but the shawshank was certainly good enough to win a couple. so if you havent seen the shawshank redemption buy it rent it and watch one of the most powerful and moving films ever be prepared to be blown away.this film is amazingand coolthis is the best than the orderthis is a very nice film over the other this movie it was great it was very fantastic movie  i love this movie and this movie it was great this is a very nice film over the other this movie it was great it was very fantastic movie  i love this movie and this movie it was great this is a very nice film over the other this movie it was great it was very fantastic movie  i love this movie and this movie it was great this is a very nice film over the other this movie it was great it was very fantastic movie this is a very nice film over the other this movie it was great it was very fantastic movie  i love this movie and this movie it was great  i love this movie and this movie it was greatthis film is amazing because it has a great screen-play it is at the same time an excellent thriller and an intelligent comedy and we only can see it in a few brilliant movies a fabulous director quentin tarantino that had done other great movies like jackie brown or reservoir dogs and well actors and actresses mainly john travolta with the best movie of his career the incredible samuel l jackson and uma thurman i think the first and the last moments of the movie are only some of the best moments of cinema that i saw in my life i think its incredible how a great movie like pulp fiction didnt won the oscar of best movie of the year losing to the good but not excellent forrest gump pulp fiction isnt only one of the best movies of the 90s it is for me one of the best movies of everthis film is about hope friendship and redemption. it has solid performances from morgan freeman tim robbins and bob gunton the warden. freeman masterfully narrates and he is the life blood of this film. you experience everything through himthis film is a true fairy tale its dark its raw and its written from the dark raw experience of women maleficent is about what happens when your prince turns into a frog its the personal inner journey to recover from a physical trauma and emotional betrayal by those who are closest to us and who we trust the most its about how to survive that type of horrific evil without becoming evil yourself its message is that profound the critics complaining about this film want fairy tales to stay in the same onelovefitsall mode where people are either good or evil and that all one needs is to find romantic love and marry a good prince or princess and you will live happily ever after safe from any pain or sorrow but real life is a lot messier than that its actually evidence of how rare it is to see womens unfiltered subjective emotional landscape portrayed on film that it seems many of the critics cannot even wrap their brains around it no matter this film is so sensually visually stunning and viscerally emotionally cathartic that sheer word of mouth enthusiasm is going to make this a blockbuster no matter what the critics say and its equally rare to see a protagonist whose inner landscape is more complex than simply extracting revenge destroying their enemies androll credits people are more complicated than that fairy tale we are sold in every other action and adventure film that only serves to reinforce the psychopathic values of revenge and bravado sometimes a film is so ahead of its time that the critics are behind and so philosophically deep that its message is incomprehensible to the more superficial among us this is one such film woolverton and jolie have crafted a masterpiece dont miss itthis film is a classic and its the dialogue that really clinches it for me - sharp snappy humorous and delivered at a break neck speed - so much so that the subtleness of it requires you to re-watch the film time and again by now ive seen this film 15 or so times and new things still pop up i wont go over the context or the plot of the film as this is well covered by previous comments - needless to say you can download the script from the net and it literally jumps out at you its an incredible read now if the script is that good no wonder travolta and keitel wanted to do it an awesome film - the no1 film ever made in my estimationthis film had so much energy the way angelina aced her strong amazing performance did this films justice she pushed herself to build a relationship with maleficent although critics were skeptical  the film itself has made $745 million most likely for jolies performance i loved her in this film she is the only reason i choose to see this film again and again oscar nomiantion is for sure worthy for her role elle fanning gave a sweet yet stunning performance also she gave aurora what she needed for fans who have not yet seen this film if you are expecting the orinal  you will be let down this is showing the film from a new point of viewthis film blew me away and it is hard to describe why seeing it together with 1500+ captivated and enthusiastic people at one of the berlinale friedrichstadtpalast screenings surly helped yet what makes this film so unique and touching is its deep humanity although it is a fictional piece you cant help not to relate to the actors as if it would be a documentary every scene feels like real life i know that this is not necessarily a good thing to say about a movie but it is meant as a compliment the actors deliver an outstanding performance while much has already been said about the main characters i was also deeply impressed by the performance of the side characters as well as an example the actor of the second husband of olivia excels in one of the most emotionally straining scenes of the movie the dialogs are touching and feel just natural there are so many scenes and details in the movie where you feel unbelievable close to the actors when patricia arquette says as mother olivia i thought there would be more you instantly think about your own family life and its constant flux i surely hope that this movie will make it to as many screens as possible also i hope that no distributor will force additional editing on it it is perfect as it is and worth any minute if you like people in general and families in particular you will love this moviethis film along with all of the the lord of the rings trilogy are the most amazing films i have ever seen i have also read the book and the ending could have stuck to it more spoiler: saruman dies at bag end in the hands of grima wormtonguethe shire is burnt and turned bad because of them- a great scene but still entirely excellent. i especially love the fact that viggo mortensen aragorn sings and billy boyd peregrin/ pippin took... all the actors and actresses are terrific the film deserves the 11 oscars that it received. i am a peter jackson fan and tolkienite all the books are brilliant and the films match them... such a fan that i have the soundtracks i want to thank also howard shore the london philharmonic orchestra ben del maestro renee fleming sir james galaway and annie lennox for the soundtrack... and to enya sheila chandra elizabeth fraser and emiliana torrini for the fellowship of the ring and the two towers soundtrack. i cried....many a time... all i can say is watch it... see for yourself :this doesnt bode well for my reading career gone girl is spectacular a strong contender for this years best picture i couldnt recommend it more highly reading the book isnt necessary the differences between the textual and visual are minimal reconsider the commitment lingering on your bookshelf this is one flick you wont want to miss if youve got a better half bring him or her along both men and women will thoroughly enjoy its long 145 minutes total but should hold your interest throughout the screenplay for gg is by gillian flynn the same woman who penned the novel if gone girl offers any inclination toward the quality of gfs alternative texts lets hope sharp objects and dark places are greenlit director david fincher doesnt have a distinct public persona like tarantino or an iconic physical appearance like scorceses that doesnt detract from his mastery of feature film direction iconic motion pictures like fight club se7en the social network and the girl with the dragon tattoo highlight his filmography if a storys a stairway gone girl is a multitiered double escalator its extremely well written and the tension is like radio static vibrating angrily amidst the coiling  the pacing is kinetic the story constantly switching gears the humor is occasional in a realistic fashion the selfawareness is pointedly subtle the characters are sympathetic and well rounded is it even necessary to mention neil patrick harriss performance? cant we just assume he was fantastic from now on? how about ben affleck everyones favorite punching bag? folks who doubted him should be flogged with a sofa cushion upon recommending gone girl a friends initial hesitation hinges on afflecks involvement first of all thats like saying youre missing the nsync concert because you dont like jts pipes benny was never bad at acting by any stretch of the imagination folks cite 2003s gigli and daredevil as fleck daddys downfall i cant speak to the former but a final thought on the latter at fourteen years old a group of friends and i thoroughly enjoyed daredevil in the theater plus it gave us a walk in the shoes of a blind person whether we appreciated it or not we were educated on a lifestyle none of us understood i can still cite multiple scenes in detail and i havent seen daredevil since that initial viewing my basic point is dont skip gone girl because of a strong opposition to afflecks acting ability rosamund pike is lightsout shes a semiunknown but a look at her filmography proves she deserves more notoriety ive a feeling well be seeing more of her in the future the remainder of the cast is just as good but too much detail may trigger a spoiler so ill leave it at that the warm weather left with the hummingbirds but at least there are solid flicks repopulating theatersthis cant be called a feature film. this is a masterpiece like beethovens symphony. it is an insult to call this a movie. no matter how many times you watch you love it. it is music to the eyes. while enough has been said about the plot characters comparison history context i wont delve into the specifics but give the review on a very high level. this applies to both the novice as well as the critic. from so many amazing things about the movie the greatest one is the music that is what has its effect on our minds while perfectly befitting the characters plot flow of the movie. together with the characters of hero villain and the shady 3rd character the viewer feels he is the protagonist. immersive. joyous. scary. hopeful. the pace of movie the generous full blown action no holes barred spectacular scenes massive destruction grand setting is fabulous. not a single scene act dialog in this movie i believe is not appreciable. it just blends in perfectly. its a treat. you need this in your permanent collection and watch it in a home theater with full volume. listen to the tracks build an atmosphere of chaos cultivate a climate of anarchy darkness before you watch and even after the movie ends let the music roll on. this will stay with you for months. how the talented actors and the even more talented director pull off such a massive but delicate spectacular but deep grand but humane movie is a wonder in itself. this is my first ever review that too in 2013 5 years after the movie am still a fan of it. i saw the movie without any context of batman nolan i simply stepped into a movie hall one rainy evening in mumbai it was almost empty.... and at the end of it i sat alone contemplating how such a flabbergasting movie it cud be. i went home did some research saw this movie 5 more times including once in imax. my friends tell me im an ambassador of this movie but they liked it too. although i went in too deep to understand the nuances character development dialogs and the working behind it. one of them rightly said this is not an action movie. do not categorize it as such. just because it is fictional it cant be miscategorised this is an opera a drama an anthropology of our times.this a great movie if you liked this movie then i really recommend reservior dogs i just want to say one thing though what was in the briefcase well i think its marcellus wallaces soul i think he sold his soul to the devil i say this because the combination to the briefcase was 666theres nothing in life more meaningful than endlessly talking about movies and theres no discussion as entertaining as fighting over which was the best year for films. i always go for 1994 mainly because it produced three movies that are truly unique and show up in every best of list you can imagine. i mean its pretty tough to find a person that doesnt have either forrest gump pulp fiction or the shawshank redemption in their personal top ten. while the first two movies still have a considerable group of opponents to some people forrest gump is too much of a tearjerker while pulp fiction apparently glorifies violence too much the shawshank redemption is one of those movies nobody can really dislike. its a movie that goes beyond matters of taste the story writing and acting are so undeniably good that its tough to come up with a counterargument. writer/director frank darabont is also a fantastic dialogue writer particularly when it comes to bit characters. you can also see this in the somewhat inferior the green mile characters who only have one or two lines say the perfect line on the perfect moment. the amazing performances by tim robbins and morgan freeman do the rest. the best movie ever made its definitely up there.theres a sag in the film not in this film this is awesome. the trilogythere will never be another superhero film that can beat the dark knights its unbelievably good. it continues on from batman begins showing a more experienced batman in a darker gotham city. the dark knight shows batman pushed to his limits leaving the audience questioning whether he will give in. everything you could want from a realistic batman film is there and i cant think of many ways that this masterpiece could be improved. every scene is amazing and heath ledgers acting is better than any ive ever seen before making it impossible to look away from the screen. it is not necessary to watch batman begins prior to the dark knight however to fully understand the story id recommend it as batman begins is an outstanding example of an origin story so you might as well see the full trilogy.there is nothing i like more than a good thriller that is without a doubt my favourite genre that being said it is quite rare that i came across one that really has me absolutely gripped from the opening minute to the very last at best i have only come across some pretty great ones however gone girl definitely takes the prize for the best one that i have ever seen i wish that i had read the book first so that i could comment on how faithfully it has been adapted however since the screenplay is written by flynn herself i can imagine that it doesnt hold much difference only in the character depth which is always better developed through the work of a novel for obvious reasons what i can say though is that it certainly was safe in the hands of the brilliantly talented david fincher fincher is simply one of the best directors out there after all this is the same man that has given us such memorable gems as the social network 2010 zodiac 2007 panic room 2002 seven 1995 and many more simply put gone girl was destined for his spectacular direction and boy did he deliver gone girl is a remarkable piece of filmmaking on so many different levels the story itself is one of the most thought provoking and engaging that i have ever had the pleasure of viewing it had me wonderfully gripped right from the off its not often that i find myself dissecting and questioning the events throughout the entire thing but this one brilliantly had my mind rollercoastering all the way through it twists and turns with such unique and refreshing mastery that you feel like the whole thing is happening around you gone girl is the screen definition of a spectacular page turner and fincher delivers it with some of the best direction that he has ever done i cant help but think that in the hands of anyone else this film would not have been executed with the same quality of impact that the story deserved this for me is one of his best films if not the best no small feat considering his fantastic library of work a novel adaptation of this calibre though cannot rely purely on the talents of its director to tell the story without a great cast to act it out it is nothing more than a great story weakly portrayed fortunately gone girl succeeds in this too i get pretty sick and tired with the constant ben affleck bashing to be honest i dont think that anyone can deny that he is an awesome director and a talented writer ill say that straight off but whilst he may have been less than aweinspiring an actor in his earlier years ill defy anybody to tell me that he has not improved with age i think people just need to accept the fact that he is the next batman and stop being so ridiculous about it which is basically what it comes down to i see far bigger stars that have had much longer careers that dont have the fraction of acting ability that affleck does affleck is so multidimensional in the role of nick dunne that you really dont know what to make of him as a character all you can only ever really do is speculate on his guilt and innocence and formulate your own ideas concerning what may or may not have happened dunnes cocksure and blas demeanour is a fantastic shield when trying to determine the level of involvement in his wifes disappearance if any at all he is uniquely likable and dislikable at the same time this is absolute credit to afflecks performance and capabilities he completely nails and owns this character from start to finish that being said as great as he is i think the best performance of the film truly belongs in the hands of rosamund pike as nicks wife amy she is unarguably magnificent there is not too much that i can say about her character to be honest only that pike really does show the strength of her acting skills and i loved every moment that she was on screen overall gone girl is a splendid thought provoking mystery with plenty of twists and turns that will have you gripped throughout it is a marvellous guessing game and one you will still be talking about long after the end credits have rolled it is ultimately satisfying and rewarding in its climax and you wont get to the end and question why you bothered watching it in the first place gone girl also has a great supporting cast including neil patrick harris tyler perry kim dickins carrie coon and missi pyle among others if you have not had the pleasure of seeing this yet then i highly recommend that you get on it as soon as you can you will not be disappointed easily one of the best films of the year stunningthere is nothing i like more

i highly recommend that you get on it as soon as you can you will not be disappointed easily one of the best films of the year stunningthere is not a fault that you can declare with a film that was shot for 12 years kept the exact same cast and delivered a powerful movie of a boy named mason its great to go and criticise movies but there was a moment that i could flaw this film with the unnoticeable changes of years it provides you with so many segments that create such power moods that you can relate to as a person growing up i call this a feel good film it has its funny moments and quite frankly was enjoyable all the way through there are dark scene that were delivered quite perfect that really left me pinned back in my seat after watching the trailer it was fair to say i had already classed this movie as beautiful and it sure was indeed finding a movie these days to please you is quite a difficult task whereas this movie has a simple plot growing up how you deal with yourself and what you will come across the movie really makes you feel as though you are growing up with it adapting to the really likable characters is consistent there is a lot of movies that have blew me away this year and by the forgotten director in my eyes linklater has really shown up to me and provides a movie that will feed your every instinct in what you love about a movie boyhood is beautifulthere is no shortage to say that peter jackson and his staff of creators and actors have left its mark in the history of visual story telling for as long as time shall go. history will continue to revile this gem of our time and i feel lucky to be part of its birth and continuation to fill the hearts of love for films. its visual achievements stand proud even ten years down the evolution of movie crafting and howard shore delivers a  which will define brilliance in motion picture soundtracks. it is truly one of the rare films i watch dearly once a year and still gives me chills smiles and touch the deep heartstrings i so seldom touch in real life. it is a reminder of the beauty in life and that darkness is but a passing no matter how great. it is indeed a movie which is pro-lifethere is no other word to describe this film everything from the casting to the choice of music is perfect in my opinion there is humour violence shock it has everything a film needs and they are all portrayed in a sensational way for people who havent seen the film it is a collection of stories all jumbled out of chronological order and all are somehow intertwined the individual stories themselves are wonderful and i would watch them on their own the way that tarantino has put all the stories together so that we still arent sure how they all connect until right at the end is amazing the film somehow has a gritty reality to it even though some of the events that happen are ridiculous they are believable all the same the amazing thing is that tarantino always manages to produce incredible films this is imo the best film that he has made and probably ever made and for any fan or in fact anyone who has not seen this film yet go out and buy it nowthere is no film that has touched me and few that have touched anyone as much as this one tarantino has a penchant for violence as do many of the big name actors like jackson and willis but so does the human race theres more to us and more to the film the fact that it creates so many unanswered questions the fact that i can watch it again and again and still see new things even its tie-ins to other qt movies all add up to a depth and complexity that uses violence and sex - it is not used by it its ironic that such a pulp/pop film could do it but we live in a world of strip malls where we pick up donuts a world with pawnshops run by long-hairs with reb flags and a world of people with accents from faraway places it adds to a mystery - where is it from fabiennes accent why is she esmerelda villalobos here none of these are crucial to the plot just like subway chatter and personal romance are not necessary for survival yet we find ourselves doing them day in and day out why does marsellus have a band-aid whats in the briefcase why does mindless violence fascinate us why are we enamored with the intricatethere is no doubt that this film breaks through as one of the best film adaptations of a comic book. christopher nolan has taken the world of batman and turned into real life creating a sense that how would the world of batman look and feel if it was in our world. right from the start in the opening scene shot in imax displaying a deep detailed view of gotham you immediately become immersed in this film. as the film progresses you get drawn more and more into the film it starts to seem less fantasy and has a realness to it mirroring our real world. when casting of heath ledger as the joker was released many people could not see him being this iconic villain heath was sweet nice and had that gentleman quality to him that you see in his other films. when you first see him in the opening bank robbery scene when he takes his mask off you right away see that this was a new joker that was not seen before with scars and messy make-up and messy hair. it has a sense of psychotic craziness with a hint of master mind that is unpredictable in nature but completely thought out in detail. in the later scenes you see the joker only wants one thing and that is chaos to watch the world burn. he kills a few people without even passing a glance at them but can not find himself to kill the batman it plays out as a yin-yang. batman showing that the world is full of people ready to believe in good but the joker shows how even the best can be broken down. you dont realize it is heath behind the make-up and character you immerse yourself into thinking that is the joker. the story has a mix of high action parts as well as slower parts bouncing back and forth creating a dynamic range that isnt to much or to little but keeps your attention through out. it is a true master piece that is a must to watch whether you are a die hard batman fan or not it is a great movie through out.there is just one thing that differentiates a legend from ordinary man. its his fight with inner demons to over come all his fear. that defines a legend. and this is what batman stands for. batman is not just another comic character but its a complete saga of how you stand tall in spite of losing everything walk fearlessly even when you are lonely and how you fight back against all odds and over shadow your own fear. fear- the most dominated emotion mankind has ever witnessed. batman is no exception he still has fear he still gets scared of losing those who are close to him and he is still in doubts when it comes to decision. but what is interesting and inspirational about batman is that he has the ability to use wisely the biggest and most dangerous weapons of all time perfectly- brain thats why he is my favourite comic character and this time batman is putting everything on the line to save the world from out of control freak- the joker. a spell bounded performance by heath ledger as the joker. though he is no more with us but his immortal act as joker is an oscar winning performance and will always be remembered. your heart comes out to mouth to see the horror joker creates. in start i was bit confused as his performance reminded me of jack nicholson from the first batman movie but later i realised that this is for real. he did not imitate jack but showcased the true and horrible side of a real joker. the best part about heath is that he displayed the flip side of a joker- fearless. there are many times when we feel that some one could have done better with certain roles but not here. here heath is perfect as a joker and from now on i will call him heath joker ledger the story is about a terror that has shaken the underworld of gotham. the fear of batman is getting in to criminal minds and all of them are now thinking where their money can be saved from batmans reach. and thats where the joker comes with a plan to these criminals- kill batman. now with his perverted mind the joker is behind batmans life and what follows is a scary hell of a ride of hide n seek game of faith vs. courage. at one end joker has no fear and on the other batman has a responsibility of saving gotham. now the important question is that who will win and more than that at what cost apart from breaking box office records this movie is also able to break the pattern of film making. batman series is an action series. when you make an action movie you give the required pace in a movie by focusing on elaborating the action scenes but here the director builds the movie with a mix of action as well as other emotional scenes. step by step movie gives its audience action and emotion at the time when its required but with an unexpected style. dark intense and a complete batman style. the batman movies are famous for its back ground music and the dark knight is no exception. specially when there is sound of a whistle in background of some intense scenes in the movie. i felt a rush in to my blood and boiling my brain. my eyes popped out while watching those scenes. to mention batmans grilling session with the joker is a masterpiece. the scene was simply awesome mainly coz of background music. harvey dents character could have been better post he becomes 2-faced. i was expecting his character to be more involved and longer in the series. rachel dawes is also a very strong influencing character in the movie. her involvement in the movie is much focused than katie holmes in batman begins but the point im making here is the glam factor in this movie. she was not given that much footage in a glamorous way. nevertheless the plot did not allow audience to think that way either. action scenes in this movie are well thought of and will chill the audiences spinal chords. my favourite is the chase scene where joker is trying best to catch harvey dent and how batman comes in between. this is where batman says asta la vista and welcomes his new girl friend- his damn new bike its called batpod i can imagine how excited you will be when you know that batman is now going to catch the joker and joker is happy that batman has missed his shot. this is sheer delight to watch the creative involvement of special effects blended with brilliant cinematography. unlike other hollywood flicks the dark knight is a lengthy movie of more than 2 Ó_ hrs of non-stop adrenaline but you wont mind spending that much time watching it. many times we feel that some movies couldve been shorter and some lengthier but with the dark knight thats not the case. its mainly because the movie ends up at the time when it is required to scroll the curtains down. i was so satisfied while coming out from the movie hall. perfect ending well the dark knight is just a beginning. now im expecting the penguin and the riddler to come in to the picture and take this battle ahead. as i said earlier im a big fan of batman and after this movie im mad about not just batman but each and every part of his movies music and the joker. now while im rushing straight to the nearest movie store to buy all original movies and soundtracks of batman series you go ahead and enjoy a fearless life just like the joker or batman- choice is yoursthere is a reason the shawshank redemption has been at #1 of the imdb top 250 for as long as i can remember. it is probably the best movie that has ever been made. not because of the thrilling special effects it hardly has any. not because of the daring experimental innovations it has brought us it is a quite straightforward movie. but because of its simple beautiful storyline and its great characters. they send you here for life. thats exactly what they take. the strength of this movie is that darabont is able to show what it means to completely lose are perspective and dreams for the future. to show how the people inside shed off their old lives and get used to the terrible life in shawshank prison. we can truly understand how a man can become institutionalized. how people get used to living under a repressive regime and cant face changing it. we see how the old brooks cant deal with the world around him and commits suicide. how red faces the same challenges when he cant take a leak without asking permission. inside the joint these men had a certain standing they were important people. being set free is not easy when your live has been taken from you. - why did you do it - i didnt since you ask. - you gonna fit right in. half of the movie we dont know for sure whether andy is guilty or not. it doesnt matter so much. what is important is not his past. rehabilitated what does that word even mean in prison you live a whole different life. with whole different rules. without a past. or a future. andy is the exemption. he shows us the remedy against becoming institutionalized. by never accepting our destiny. by never giving up. by always keeping our dreams alive. - there are places in the world that arent made out of stone. there is something inside that they cant touch. - what are you talking about -hope. - let me tell you something my friend hope is a dangerous thing. hope can drive a man insane. you better get used to that idea. but andy doesnt get used to that idea. he has received two things by the warden. discipline and the bible. and he uses these two things to get out and escape to the paradise called zihujataneo. there are two things that make this movie so extremely good. the first thing is that we all can relate to andy. i must admit i didnt think much of andy first time i laid eyes on him. he had a quit way about him. a walk and a talk that just wasnt normal around here. andy is a normal guy. he is smart he is doing good. but he is not extremely strong or extremely smart or extremely rich. in other words: he is us. he is elevated a little bit above the criminals in prison but his two most important characteristics are characteristics that deep down inside us we all have: hope and determination. these two emotion are so strong and so pure that we all love to see the live of andy. that is what makes this movie so appealing. and by living just your live as best as you can by never giving up and by keeping your dignity at all times we see that we can inspire people. brooks was here. so was red. red didnt choose that path of brooks. red hasnt become completely institutionalized. because he lived with andy and dreamed a bit of his dreams. we the normal movie-watchers have never been to prison. and certainly there is nobody who can play the role of an older brother as the great morgan freeman and this might be his best performance of his live. darabont shows a lot of skill in movie-directing and can let years pass in his movie without one moment losing our attention. there is a great soundtrack which breathes the smell of southern america into our living rooms. but im convinced that what makes this movie so great is that it inspires us all. we are not stuck in a prison but certainly we can be stuck in our lives. change is hard and also outside of prison it is possible to become institutionalized. we can have a life that seems to have no past and not future. that seems to be unrelated to all the other things that happen in the world. andy learns us to never give up. to never lose faith. to always keep hoping and dreaming about paradise. i guess it comes down to a simple choice. get busy living or get busy dying.there have been many cases in film history when a film is terrific do to the actors. then there are some films are great because of what was written. with the shawshank redemption imdbs favorite film in works in both cases. the acting is superb and the film is incredibly well written and very justified. tim robbins plays andy dufrense a banker who has been accused of murdering his wife and her lover. so he is sent to shawshank prison where he experiences lots of things. he forms a bond with redplayed terrificly by morgan freeman. the wardenplayed by bob gunton hates him. he is raped. and all of this is leading to his escape after being in there for over twenty years. the shawshank redemption which is based on a shot story by stephen king is one of the most interesting films ever made. ita also one of the best films ever made too. what is one way to tell: when you hear morgan freemans narration you know youre in good hands. the acting is explosive. everyone does such a good job. the shawshank redemption is a little long but the length is tolerable. mainly because from the opening scene the film has you hooked. morgan freeman gives the better performance of the two but the duo of robbins and freeman is once in a lifetime. the shawshank redemption was an oscar upset. it was nominated for seven including best picture best actormorgan freeman and best writing. and it lost best picture to forrest gump which is also a great movie. 94 was the year of pulp fiction also. another oscar upset. i prefer pulp fiction but the shawshank redemption is still one of the best films ever made. the shawshank redemption:a+  there is blood gore limbs cut off people on horses being crushed and kicked through the air by giant elephants called mumakil  you see orcs shoot a million arrows at an oncoming rohan army and when they hit the horses they flop to the ground and the riders hit it hard and are thrown  you see armies crushing other armies in waves literally  you see rocks from catapults hit and crush people in the wonderfully-made city immense destruction trolls whacking people and crushing them with their clubs and so on. there is a lot of violence i havent gotten to describe that explains the sheer immensity of this film and remember those gargoyles from the second film they call nazgul well lets just say gondorian soldiers taste good and are fun to pick up and drop from 1000 feet in the air however violence and gigantic battles is not only what makes this film great. what makes it great are the characters who you love so much the music which is some of the best i ever heard and most of all the visuals. they are very amazing and beautiful. even minas morgul the dark city of mordor is an eye-catcher. the scenery of new zealand-which is where this work of art was filmed-is just wonderful. the special effects are also some of the best ive ever seen. the oliphaunts nickname for the mumakil the giant elephants are cgi but not obviously. they are some of the most real-looking fake images ive ever witnessed the soldiers which get crushed thrown the horses that are thrown they all look real too which is what makes the battle scenes frightening they look so real the best special effect in the film however is gollum. he is also the best acted-character in the film and the best acted cgi character ever he practically is real from his emotions to his body to the hairs on his head his voice is also memorable i am trying to perfect doing it myself. he is a sight to see. the script is amazing the story is amazing everything is amazing this is one of my highest-recommended films. thank you j.r.r. tolkien for creating this wonderful story. thank you peter jackson for interpreting this wonderful story to film. and thank you all for making this possible. 10 out of 10 there arent many films that can capture you and absorb you for almost 3 hours boyhood did i went into it thinking it would be another inflated award nominated let down having heard about it for some time now and moving from excitingly wanting to see it to feeling as though the hype had taken over graciously i was wrong the characters and story whilst simple and quiet absorb you and lead you to invest in wanting to see how this normal life of a boy and family filmed for 13 years changes nothing happens? depends on the viewers perception of nothing and if its storytelling or spectacle you want i love both in films but would choose the storytelling characters and heart of boyhood over any recent films if not most films excellentthere are very few people ive met who did not like the dark knight 2008. they tend to dislike the fact that it is so rooted in reality but for me when compared with how outrageous the batman mythos can get this is a major plus that wins this film 10 out of 10 stars. lets start off with the best: heath ledger whilst different as the joker incorporates so much from the batman comics character into his performance that even though hes punk-ish and diverse in the role i totally bought him as being an updated version of the clown prince of crime. his untimely death cheated the cinema of an up-and-coming name but this is such a great legacy for him to leave behind. this is not to say that i prefer him over jack nicholson or vice versa. what nicholson did in batman 1989 was loyal and apt for that film. but this film charts dangerous characters in a dangerous world that has clearly changed since tim burtons first batman opus and nolan proves that whilst the old batman films may have been made for sheer entertainment value he is trying to convey a message to his audience. whether you buy that message or not is all a matter of interpretation. the return to chicago as the main spread of gotham city was a fantastic idea and even though i miss some of the landmarks of the previous film particularly wayne tower i accept why nolan changed pace with this sequel and hey at least the monorail makes a discreet return in some scenes here the use of locations is absolutely stunning. i am not sure if it was nolans filming style or the fact that this film did things that seemed so new in an age where everything seems to have already been done but there are plenty of memorable stunts and dialogue sequences here. unlike many i also enjoyed the character of rachel dawes and whilst i accept that katie holmes was a little inexperienced in batman begins 2005 her character wasnt used to being confronted by crooks quite as freaky as the scarecrow was she holmes replacement here by maggie gyllenhaal albeit complicating the continuity between the two films slightly seems quite appropriate. gyllenhaal is more convincing in her work with both aaron eckhart and heath ledger but i agree that she is heartless and ungrateful to christian bales batman/bruce wayne. but in many ways that adds to the poignancy of both this film and its sequel. moving along to harvey dent you may be a billy dee williams fan or a tommy lee jones person but you cannot deny that aaron eckhart gives equal consideration to both dent and his twisted alter-ego harvey two- face. in fact i think that harvey and two-face have rarely been adapted in a better way with one of the other great interpretations being two-face parts i & ii from batman: the animated series. but this is the first live-action depiction of the character/s to really come through in showing both of them although i would have liked two- face to be carried over into another sequel. but we must not sideline batman/bruce wayne must we christian bale continues to be one of the better performers to play batman but i know that his gravelly batman voice has irritated many. sure bales batman voice is sometimes difficult to understand on a first viewing and is certainly hilarious when taken in isolation or imitated on youtube but if bruce wayne didnt disguise his voice it would be even more obvious that he was batman wouldnt it michael caine again lends warmth and even more depth to his depiction of alfred pennyworth whilst morgan freeman remains charming and refreshing as lucius fox. gary oldman is given quite a wedge of the plot himself and it is interesting to see that whilst other actors to portray jim gordon were restricted in what the character could do he undertakes almost as much as the dark knight himself one other character from the previous film makes a playful and often overlooked return just after the jokers opening bank robbery but it is awesome to see that nolan didnt just shoot the scene using a stuntman. and the batmobile and its successor remain the stars of the gadgetry rolled out for this instalment especially in a chase scene that will literally knock your socks off. in the gadgets section however there is a new sonar toy that can be disorienting to audiences on the first few viewings of the film but as you get used to it its not a lot of trouble at all. hans zimmer and james newton howard deliver a tense and exciting  that showcases the jokers chaotic new theme whilst developing the themes for batman and bruce waynes personal life as introduced in the previous film. on that note even though viewing batman begins isnt essential viewing for this instalment it has surprised me how many people were unaware of it before seeing this film. its okay to miss out batman begins here but if youre intending to watch the dark knight and the dark knight rises 2012 you had best watch batman begins first as you will be very lost when it comes to understanding the final instalment anyway now that weve got all of that sorted sit back and enjoy a film that undoubtedly is a modern classic that raised the bar not only for comic book films but continues to serve as a massive inspiration in many other areas i.e. sherlock the avengers skyfall etc.  it was made for anybody who loves a great story. j.r.r tolkien knew that and so did peter jackson. and thats why the lotr trilogy is so marvellously good. there are very few films that can simply blow a human beings mind away but boythere are only a handful of films that have shaken me to my core and continued to resonate with me for very long after their first viewing. i can happily say that the shawshank redemption has stuck to me since i finished watching it for the first time and instantly rocketed up my top 10 films list. most great films have one or two obvious flaws that can be easily picked out - not so in shawshank at least not to me. the hefty run time doesnt put me off because the story and characters are just so well rounded and so easy to return to time and time again. shawshank is one of those films that i would love to experience for the first time all over again. the thrill of emotions and the highs and lows i felt that first time are incomparable to much else. in my opinion forrest gump was not as deserving of the best picture oscar as this. the timeless feel of a story of friendship in a hopeless place will likely continue to capture generations of people for years to come.there are only a few movies that one will see in their lifetime that affects the course of your life. i have loved the shawshank redemption since i first saw it but only recently had its powerful effect shown to me. in short order i lost my father to illness my wife to separation and my career to anger and dismay. lost in depression mired in pain and alone in a large house i watched it again. between brooks suffering reds hatred of hope and andys response to his final isolation i stopped feeling alone. it is simple...get busy living or get busy dying. this movie gave me the strength to start over. the movie is popular for many reasons but it has a healing power for people trapped in their own shawshank.there are no flaws in tdk. the acting the story the characters everything was absolutely amazing. the highlight of this movie is obviously heath ledger. his brutal haunting and somehow charming performance perfected this movie. christian bale did great as bruce wayne/batman. though the character didnt emote as much as i thought he shouldve but its not cbs fault its the writers. aaron eckhart did great in the transformation of the hero to the villain great great performance and cool effects on his face. all in all its a pretty amazing movie and i recommend it to anyone and everyone  you start slowly after a while you get attached by the time you reach the middle of the movie you simply totally forget about anything outside the screen and feel a mixed stream of emotions going through you head before anything else then comes a last 20 minutes of heart storming that is surely enough to raise the adrenaline to extreme levels even in diabetics i felt warm strong happy and all other emotions one can think of i felt i was the one who won who got out of prison i was simply fully satisfied. this movie must be used as an anti-depression by therapists this movie proves that oscars are either money bought gifts or that who ever in charge of them are so smart that they couldnt give any oscar to the shawshank redemption knowing that the movie is on different - much higher- rating scale than the oscars.. its simply over qualified there are few movies that capture and identify with the american male spirit. shawshank is one of those movies. i dont care what anyones take is on prison treatment or whether you are conservative or liberal this movie is moving. there are three movies in my opinion that every man or developing man should watch: shawshank redemption dancing with wolves and brave heart. unless you are a total pansy these are the movies that will confirm your heterosexuality. andy dufrane is the person in us. red is the person we want to be. aside from the being in prison the job they have is well apt to the people of this great nation.their are a lot of films now a days that are just so bland and uninteresting. but this film comes to none of that every second of this movie is just so fascinating from the dialoge that some characters share or just the insanity of the situations that occurs. in my opinion this film is just about how crazy life can get and quentin tarintino takes it as far as possible. the acting is great in this movie but even if this movie had terrabel acting it wouldent matter because this dialog is jut so realistic that any one can pull it off. but overall this movie just fascinates me every time i see this movie theres something new i notice about it. ill see the camera do something ive never seen before or ill learn something new about the characters i didnt know before. its a wild ride from start to finish. i adore this movie to deaththe ultimate action with a dazzling mind game incredible acting superb technology innovation with a tint of fiction makes this movie my one of the favorites. finding the goodness even after you surrounded by evil souls and losing your dear ones is what the batman gives the message. christian bale is the most deserving actor for this role and the great heath ledger rip. the dark night rises is also a great hammer on the nail but it was no match to this one. christopher nolan work will be accredited lifelong. and it is his remarkable work which has left its mark on fans heart. for all those who hadnt got the chance take time its worth it and for those who have watched it i bet you wouldnt have been got away with jokers magic.the two best things about this film are the story-telling techniques and the imagery both proving that quentin tarentino is the finest film maker of our time the story jumps around in both time and place switching between a large set of seemingly independent characters and stories which all intersect to make a whole far greater than the sum of its parts and the juxtaposition of images is amazing: the rich drug kingpins wife overdosing on the floor of a low-level drug dealers home  the mob enforcers covered in blood in a suburban middle class house  bruce willis walking down some stairs carrying a sword wearing a white t-shirt splattered red with blood standing in front of a blue background and proving that there can be honour among thieves you dont so much watch the movie as experience itthe true masterpiece this movie has a quite way defining the life struggles deep happiness and sadness. the director has completely understood the movie and so all his efforts we can see here. nothing less than a divine gift to the world. once anyone sees definitely he is going to repeat it a lot often. andy dufresne tim robbins and red morgan freeman both have best performances. the best ending scene of this movie i have ever scene showing kind of deja-vu and divine feeling to me. it is the movie about friendship and slow-redemption. you might not blink for a second to see what next it would lead to. each character is fitted to their roles perfectly and they have given a flawless justification to that. a prison life is depicted in this movie which is looks vivid. i would say that this movie is aptly rated. this movie has a way to touch your heart by means of showing a true hope.the trilogy of the lord of the rings is the best trilogy ever made and it is amazing... of course that dont have everything that are in the books like: -tom bombadil -barrow wights -erkenbrand -the grey company -the gondor reinforcements in ships from other cities -the lords of gondor like elphir hirluin... -dol amroth and prince imrahil and their charge to help the rohirrim -battle in the shire -the scout of gondor that send the red arrow -ghan-buri-ghan and his people -sam use the ring and other things but the movies arent the book is not because of that that the movie is better or worse the movie is an adaptation not the book... my advice 1st of all is to you see the extended versions have some more and cool details that make the trilogy better : the scenarios are amazing the mountains and all this the backgrounds are amazing i think it was a great production : so my congratulations to the all people that act indirect or direct in the movie and all the fans of tolkien that make possible all this huge success... now wait for the hobbit : in short words: lotr -> epic : sy for my english portuguese here regards rodolfo fernandes costathe third installment of tolkeins masterful trilogy explodes to life on screen in rotk. from the intro flashback scene to our final farewells i was literally on the edge of my seat. this film is like a rollercoaster ride at mach 1. my only small complaint is that i could have gone for an extra 10 or 15 minutes worth of legolas and gimli they felt slightly underused. all in all one of my favorite movies of all timethe third installment of the lord of the rings trilogy is by far the best of the three films. the cast of the return of the king make the 3 and a half hour film fly by in what seems like a matter of minutes. in seeing the first two films we already know that the chemistry of these actors is amazing but in the third and final installment we see the characters at the climax of their on screen performances. the relationships have grown so tight throughout the trilogy that these characters are more realistic and believable than ever. the film yet again shows us astounding visual effects and some of the best action than any other movie of 2003. this film will leave you captivated and wanting to see more and more. the lord of the rings: the return of the king is without a doubt one of the best films of 2003.the third and final installment of the lord of the rings trilogy comes to life bigger and bolder than the first two. director peter jackson and company held nothing back when it came to cgi special effects gorgeous landscapes and breathtaking cinematography. fans most familiar with tolkiens famed novels would take note of changes made in the interest of keeping the film short as with its two prior films but he stuck close enough the main story and brought it to its destined conclusion. he didnt water down the scene where frodo finally gets to mt. doom in order to get rid of the one ring once and for all_„îin fact it packs quite the punch. the way that scene was intermingled with the battle footage heightened the emotional level of the scene as well as the excitement. the actors deserve praise as well. viggo mortensen reminds us of what a hero truly is with his performance as aragorn the man who would become king of gondor. sir ian mckellen reprises his role as gandalf the white bringing the wizard to life as if he popped right out of the pages of tolkiens novels. elijah wood draws us in with his portrayal as frodo_„î sorrowful and weary of his travels and all of the trials hed gone through along the way. other noteworthy performances include those of liv tyler cate blanchet miranda otto dominic monaghan billy boyd hugo weaving etc. i highly recommend this film as well as its predecessors to anybody regardless of whether or not youve read the novels. of course the books are better_„îthey always are_„îbut the movies are an excellent adaptation of tolkiens wonderful tale. this film is clearly worthy of the many oscars it has won. i easily give it a 10/10.the third and final installment of the lord of the rings trilogy comes to

easily give it a 10/10.the thing really blew my mind about this movie was how the 3 dimensional 4 dimensional 5 dimensional spaces met at specific time when i heard about those dimensional spaces at first time i couldnt even imagine what it looks like but christopher nolan helped me out even though its just an one side of fiction to see i found so many knowledge of physics on this movie i was wondering if there is any other living earth or something? the answer is still not sure we dont know how 4 or 5 dimensional spaces work unless we go through in also the time difference really does make sense to me maybe someone in the other galaxy comes to us that person or something may just spend 10 minutes to get here and we may just face hundreds of year wow its truly blowing my mindthe theme to this film which is a continuation in the series and in theme from batman begins is that good versus evil is not only an external fight between a good guy and a bad guy but also is a constant battle that rages inside each and every one of us. christian bale as bruce wayne is forced to make a great deal of judgment calls based upon the circumstances being piled against him by the joker played by heath ledger. unfortunately some of the choices and actions he performs cause him to become alienated from his closest friends and ultimately the city in its entirety. but in doing so he solidifies himself as the classic tragic hero that the city loves and hates in equal measure. throughout the film harvey dent played by aaron eckhart undergoes a dramatic transformation through giving in to this darker side. he begins as what the people of gotham city refer to as the white knight due to his relentless pursuit of justice and for being a seemingly incorruptible source of good. as he is brought low by the machinations of the joker bruce is forced to sacrifice his own appearance of good to prevent dents fall from grace from completely disheartening the already injured psyche of gotham city. in keeping with the tradition of batman begins this film goes above and beyond anything i expected or hoped for. bale ledger and eckhart form an engrossing triangle that keeps you at the edge of your seat throughout. with equal parts action and suspense youre never left complacent. the characters are so real that you find yourself getting sucked into their world almost immediately. bale continues to make bruce wayne a believable albeit moody hero forced into making decisions that i wouldnt wish upon even my worst enemy. with a villain like the joker many myself included were worried about whether he would be convincing as a source of evil as opposed to a quirky joke of a nemesis as has been too frequently betrayed in the past through the batman franchise just watch jim carrey as the riddler in batman & robin. ledger gave a mind-blowing performance with equal parts cruelty humor and crazy. he created a persona so creepy yet brilliant youre almost always left in awe when he is on the screen. all in all a fantastic sequel that leaves the audience veritably foaming at the mouth for the next installment.the story the action the heart the lord of the rings: the return of the king has it all. no matter how many times you watch it you will get goosebumps every time. frodo and sam are getting closer to mordor with their guide gollum while the rest of middle earth prepare for the great battle of their time. other critics say that the movie uses excessive battle sequences and visual effects to fool the audience by blowing their minds. but the massive epic battles show the significance of the story. gollum tricking frodo to let sam go faramir facing inevitable death to earn his fathers love aragorn finally stepping up to become king and a loving using friendship loyalty and courage to defeat evil. not to mention howard shores masterpiece music.the story of cinderella can be traced back to early egypt china france germany and many other countries from around the world the most wellknown versions were written by charles perrault cendrillon and by the brothers grimm aschenputtel there have been countless film television and stage adaptations of the iconic story but the most wellknown adaptation is walt disneys 1950 animated film i first fell in love with walt disneys animated film when i was just threeyearsold it was actually the first disney film that i ever saw as a child i can still remember being captivated by the story and singing along with the songs it was as though a spell had been cast upon me but the magic never wore off at midnight there were no words to describe the level of excitement i had when i first found out that disney was developing a liveaction film of the timeless story tonight i had the opportunity to attend an advance screening of the upcoming liveaction version of walts most beloved animated film what i enjoyed most about the latest animation to liveaction treatment is that its a relatively straightforward telling of the iconic story while alice in wonderland and maleficent were reimaginings cinderella is retold respectfully for the new generation lily james cinderella and richard madden prince charming were rightfully chosen for their iconic roles lily truly captured the true essence of cinderellas charm and beauty richard those eyes ahem was truly charming in every sense of the word i loved the chemistry between the prince and cinderella  i dont think ive seen such chemistry between two characters in a disney film for a very long time its very refreshing to see a fairy tale romance blossom cate blanchett lady tremaine and helena bonham carter fairy godmother were perfectly cast for their respective roles cate not only brought a lot of depth to her character but you could tell she was enjoying the role as the malicious stepmother helena not only brought a bit of comic relief to the film but she was definitely fun to watch  although you cant help but wonder if mrs weasley actually zapped bellatrix lestrange into a parallel universe hmm? i personally believe that disney made the right decision to hire kenneth barangh to direct the film and chris weitz to write the screenplay as i was watching the film on the big screen tonight i could tell that they both approached the story with deep understanding and most importantly respect i was genuinely relieved that it wasnt ruined by some unnecessary dark and edgy plot twist phew i absolutely loved patrick doyles  for the film and found it to be quite fitting with the story it was perfectly timed and it drew you into the fairy tale world i will definitely buy the soundtrack when its released next month sandy powells costumes though silly at times were excellent i dont think ive seen such beautiful designs in one film since the golden age of hollywood i genuinely hope sandy will be nominated for an oscar for those stunning costumes bravo the film itself is a visual marvel  especially for the fairy tale genre i was truly swept away by the lavish sets that were designed by dante ferretti i dont think ive seen such a breathtaking production since the late 1930s the special effects were equally breathtaking with the dress transformation and the carriagetopumpkin scenes being two of my favourite visual highlights im genuinely happy that disney kept the magic alive in this film very impressive my only disappointment was the running time of the theatrical cut i personally believe that it should have been 10 minutes or 15 minutes longer to flesh out the story more the film flowed smoothly and didnt feel rushed but there were a number of scenes and dialogue that were unfortunately left on the cutting room floor hopefully disney will release an extended cut or include those deleted scenes on the home media release you hear me disney? despite my issue with the running time i genuinely believe that disney did something right with their latest liveaction film while most people were probably expecting a swordwielding action hero im happy that disney treated their most beloved character with the uttermost care and respect the story of cinderella is very personal to each person who has felt like the underdog but managed to rise like a phoenix from the ashes in the end if walt disney were alive today im sure he would be proud to see his most treasured little savior be retold to the new generation in a beautiful and charming way bravothe story as a whole is incredibly done everything from the camera work to the choice of words used. i also love how each character is so unique and well developed. so many small adjustments are made throughout the film to the characters make up for example which makes this such a well finished film. i highly recommend this to anyone who wants a brilliant film. 10/10. side note this is my only 10/10 film it is an emotional and thrilling film which has many plot twists. i feel like this is one of the greatest movies every made and i have many good reasons to think this. -seanthe simpler it was the better it became. the movie just showed me what i need to do in oder to become like him. thats how great the movie was. a real detective story minus the characters cape and horns. the movies complex plot was a product good understanding of a simple story. i like the way bruce wayne was portrayed a renewed man pretending to be a spoiled brat. this is just a good way to hide his true identity by being what people expect him to be. like the art of war when you are strong you pretend that you are weak. a true player of the system so he can continue with his work. the joker in this movie is just great evidence of great acting. when you begin to see the character and not the actor you begin to understand that heath did a great job on the joker. i remember the joker not heath. the movies theme and music became my last-song-syndrome great  by hans zimmer. the theme was really thought off and studied well understood the need of the story. all i can say is this is what great movies are all about.the shawshank redemption.the best movie i have seen yet.its adapted from a novel by stephen king but this is a special film even better than the novel i suppose.best adaptation yet to walk through in international cinema. the great camaraderie between tim robbins & morgan freeman is very difficult to surpass.wowwhat an on screen display by both of them. if robbins was fantastic then morgan was emphatic.brilliant acting by tim robbins.the best by him so far.even he would admit.morgan freeman comes out with an en-lighted performance.his dialogs in the film are truly inspiring & heart aching.fantastic work by him.an epitome of performance by morgan freeman.the rest of the casting is good.james whitmore as brooks is a revelationso is bob gunton as the warden. the plot is superb.ending is classy.you can never make out what happened in the end.its such a travesty that you have to watch it again.the directorial of frank darabont is top stuff whereas the screenplay by him is very much adulated.the dialogs are so memorable you will always carry them along.here are some of the best dialogs from this: andy dufresne: they say it has no memory. thats where i want to live the rest of my life. a warm place with no memory. red: let me tell you something my friend. hope is a dangerous thing. hope can drive a man insane. andy dufresne: thats the beauty of music. they cant get that from you... havent you ever felt that way about music red: we sat and drank with the sun on our shoulders and felt like free men. this movie is the epitome of all others.no movie can emulate the camaraderie between that of those two shawshank prisoners.must watch for a fabulous & thrilling experience.the shawshank redemption undoubtedly deserves to be the highest rated movie. the movie depicts how a four lettered word hope brings wonders to our lives and makes something impossible to possible. though the plot of the movie focuses on how andy dufrane a falsely convicted prisoner gets out of the prison the beauty of the movie lies in the characterization of andy dufrane just amazing and how he influences his fellow prisoner red. the narration by morgan freeman in the role of red is perhaps one of the best narrations i have ever come across. this story proves that the king of horrors stephen king is equally good at any other genre of story writinghats off. the dialogues towards the end of the movie about hope are truly inspiring. the background  of the movie is excellent. tom robbins and morgan freeman at their best in the roles of andy dufrane and red respectively. didnt watch the movie...go grab a dvd and watch it as soon as possible. cant miss a movie like this....the shawshank redemption should be played throughout the world in all schools to teach people the hard life of prison but the bond between friends and the idea of hope. morgan freeman is a second to none actor he lays the role perfectly and i could not think what the film would be like without him. all the other actors perform perfectly. this movie is a movie of inspiration and one of which will get people through harsh times. this film always restores my faith in mankind i simply love it. i first saw this film sitting on my brothers desk and i was intrigued by the idea of a film set in prison where hope and other morale values were the storyline instead of violence and havoc this is a amazing film which brings pride to the actors and crew who produced it. the setting of the movie is one of perfection the gothic grounds and the stunning facilities astound me iam finding it hard to put in to words how much this film means to me i would say it is one of the greatest films ever made in my time and i love it.the shawshank redemption is written and directed by frank darabont. it is an adaptation of the stephen king novella rita hayworth and shawshank redemption. starring tim robbins and morgan freeman the film portrays the story of andy dufresne robbins a banker who is sentenced to two life sentences at shawshank state prison for apparently murdering his wife and her lover. andy finds it tough going but finds solace in the friendship he forms with fellow inmate ellis red redding freeman . while things start to pick up when the warden finds andy a prison job more befitting his talents as a banker. however the arrival of another inmate is going to vastly change things for all of them. there was no fanfare or bunting put out for the release of the film back in 94 with a title that didnt give much inkling to anyone about what it was about-and with columbia pictures unsure how to market it shawshank redemption barely registered at the box office. however come academy award time the film received several nominations and although it won none it stirred up interest in the film for its home entertainment release. the rest as they say is history. for the film finally found an audience that saw the film propelled to almost mythical proportions as an endearing modern day classic. something that has delighted its fans whilst simultaneously baffling its detractors. one thing is for sure tho is that which ever side of the shawshank fence you sit on the film continues to gather new fans and simply will never go away. its possibly the simplicity of it all that sends some haters of the film into cinematic spasms. the implausible plot and an apparent sentimental edge that makes a nonsense of prison life are but two chief complaints from those that dislike the film with a passion. but when characters are this richly drawn and so movingly performed it strikes me as churlish to do down a human drama thats dealing in hope friendship and faith. the sentimental aspect is indeed there but that acts as a counterpoint to the suffering degradation and shattering of the soul involving our protagonist. cosy prison life you say no chance. the need for human connection is never more needed than during incarceration surely and given the quite terrific performances of robbins never better & freeman sublimely making it easy its the easiest thing in the world to warm to andy and red. those in support arent faring too bad either. bob gunton is coiled spring smarm as warden norton james whitmore is heart achingly great as the birdman of shawshank clancy brown is menacing as antagonist capt. byron hadley william sadler amusing as heywood & mark rolston is impressively vile as bogs diamond. then theres roger deakins lush cinematography as the camera gracefully glides in and out of the prison offering almost ethereal hope to our characters yes they are ours. the music pings in conjunction with the emotional flow of the movie too. thomas newmans  is mostly piano based dovetailing neatly with andys state of mind while the excellently selected soundtrack ranges from the likes of hank williams to the gorgeous le nozze di figaro by mozart. if you love shawshank then its a love that lasts a lifetime. every viewing brings the same array of emotions-anger-revilement-happiness-sadness-inspiration and a warmth that can reduce the most hardened into misty eyed wonderment. above all else tho shawshank offers hopethe shawshank redemption is without a doubt one of the most brilliant movies i have ever seen.what makes this film one of the best ever made is the message it conveys. it is one of eternal hope. andy dufresne played by tim robbins has been sent to prison for a crime he did not commit. but he never loses hope. he never gives up his quest to become a free man again. his years of tenacity patience and wits keep him not only sane but it gives his mind and a spirit a will to live. this film has a different feel to it. there has never been anything like it before and i dont know if there will again. the best movies are ones that touch the soul. it takes a movie like the shawshank redemption to touch the soul.the shawshank redemption is without a doubt one of the most brilliant movies i have ever seen. similar to the green mile in many respects and better than it in almost all of them these two movies have shown us that stephen king is a master not only of horror but also of prose that shakes the soul and moves the heart. the plot is average but king did great things with it in his novella that are only furthered by the direction and the acting is so top-rate its almost scary. tim robbins plays andy dufrane wrongly imprisoned for 20 years for the murder of his wife. the story focuses on andys relationship with red redding morgan freeman in probably his best role and his attempts to escape from shawshank. bob gunton is positively evil and frightening as warden norton and there are great performances and cameos all aroundthe shawshank redemption is undoubtedly the best best movie ever. the oscars biggest mistake was giving forrest gump the awards that shawshank deserved. not to take credit from forrest gump which is also an amazing movie but it just cant compare to shawshank. morgan freeman arguably delivers his best performance and tim robbins gives a performance that i feel is greatly underrated and also deserved an oscar nomination. the films art direction adds to the storys beauty and gives off a feeling that fills you with hope. i remember seeing the shawshank redemption on sale for $5 at wal-mart and thinking i heard this is good so i bought it. little did i know the film was worth more than gold. i bought the film and put off watching it for a couple weeks not overly anticipating watching it but finally decided to watch it when i was bored. i am a gigantic movie buff and have so many movies its almost pathetic but the shawshank redemption changed my entire view of film. now every time i watch a movie i cant help but think it cant beat shawshank. some people say that this movie is overrated but thats wrong. shawshank is an actual work of art to be compared with works of davinci and picasso. when people say this movie makes them cry they dont mean to say its so sad but that they didnt know that something of such beauty could be conveyed on screen. i believe that if everybody sees only one movie during their life it should be this one. see it now. after that imdb will seem like a whole new website because every film will seem like a different movie. it is by the very definition of the word magnificent.the shawshank redemption is the best movie of all times according to over a million voters. when i saw this movie i was amazed because of the plot of this movie and that was something that made this movie so special. i also liked this movie very much because of the cast of this movie. tim robbins andy dufresne and morgan freeman ellis boyd red redding made one of the best performances of their life. deserves to be noted that bob gunton warden norton made an also good performance. i really recommend this movie to you and i am sure that you will love it because its a movie that can teach you many things about life and the relationships between people and friends.the shawshank redemption is one of the most touching and greatest movies i have ever seen. the movie is based on the novella rita hayworth and the shawshank redemption by stephen king. unlike most of his novels king didnt write a horror story but instead a inspiring tale of hope in unlikely places. overseeing the transition from book to big screen is frank darabont who in his director debut s a home run with this movie. not only does the plot pull you in but the actors do as well. tim robbins and morgan freeman do a fantastic job as the 2 central characters and as friends. bob gunton is great in the part of the villain as the evil warden. the directing cast and plot all combine to make the movie awesome. the plot of the movie revolves around andy dufresne a man who is imprisoned for life for a crime he did not commit. over time andy becomes friends with red an inmate who runs the business of smuggling in things into the prison. the story then follows the 2 and how they handle prison life. years go by but andy continues to speak of hope. ultimately andy will commit unbelievable acts in a touching story that is truly inspirational. the message the story delivers is to never give up hoping. the climax of the movie is fantastic and the ending is one of the greatest in film history. overall the shawshank redemption remains one of the greatest films of all time.the shawshank redemption is one of the few movies adapted from books that turned out to be good .. or in this case brilliant. although the movie supposedly takes place somewhen in the 1950s i can easily imagine it being transferred to todays time and standards. the thing that is most fascinating about is is that the directors [and writers of course] didnt use extreme clichÍ©s - theres no black and white painting just numerous shades of grey. robbins and freeman both are perfect for their roles as are all of the supporting actors. finally i can understand why a certain movies gets a high ranking.the shawshank redemption is one of the best movies i have ever watched in my life. tim robbins is really a good actor and thanks to him this movie is such a success. also morgan freeman is really brought me the story. the story is excellentthe time has just flew with this movie. this movie just gets better with every showing. theres no some special effects and that is just great-just men in prison uniforms talking to each other. everyone must watch this movie.the shawshank redemption and to kill a mockingbird are the best movies i have ever seen. i do not judge it by its technical merits - i dont really care about that. i have read that citizen kane or the godfather or this or that movie is the best movie ever made. they may have the best technique or be the most influential motion pictures ever made but not the best. the best movies are ones that touch the soul. it takes a movie like the shawshank redemption to touch the soul.the shawshank redemption is most obviously one of the greatest movies in film history. tim robbins and morgan freeman make an unforgettable duo that captures the audience in magnificent acting and a well-written plot. there was not one moment where the movie did not hold my attention or seem boring. therefore it indubitably earns a 10/10 and praise. a tale of two jail inmates/friends the shawshank redemption shines a light on the injustice of this world and the pleasures of freedom after years of confinement. it proves that through all the troubling experiences one man never loses sight of his dream. this not only gives tim robbinss character a chance of redemption but also chance for morgan freemans character to be inspired by an endless struggle that pays in the end. everyone of all ages should at one point in their lives watch this movie to witness not only great entertainment but also an inspiring story.the shawshank redemption is currently number one on the imdb top 250 list. i dont particularly agree with that but it is a truly great movie nonetheless. it is moving and compelling and it touches the heart and soul. the story is set in the 1940s and it involves andy dufrense tim robbins a young man who is convicted of murdering his wife and her lover and is sentenced to life in the shawshank prison. as one would expect he is very unhappy at first but then he leans that theres something deeper that nobody can take away from you: hope. as the story unfolds over the years andy eventually becomes very influential within the prison and gains the respect of other inmates especially red morgan freeman with whom he develops a special friendship. the story isnt original or creative and its relatively simple and a bit predictable but its compelling moving and memorable and theres a bit more to it which i wont go into. the movie puts the viewer right into the footsteps experiences and emotions of the characters. tim robbins and morgan freeman put on great performances. they really bring out their characters and offer true depth and emotion. one of the major moral messages of the movie is that a person may be imprisoned even for life but the spirit can never truly be imprisoned. the movie conveys this moral message very strongly and it truly touches the heart and soul. i am very glad i watched this movie. it is a truly emotional experience.the shawshank redemption is an uplifting deeply satisfying prison drama with sensitive direction and fine performances. freeman who is simply a great actor a man who has never struck a false note in his career both narrates this tale and anchors it with his authoritative playing. a passing reference to the count of monte cristo offers a partial clue to what makes this movie compelling. top-notch performances exceptional cinematography and masterful direction combine to make this film something special indeed. i love this film. its a story about hope and dreams and one whose emotional impact is as great as the pacific ocean is blue. http://www.quantumvisionsystempdf.com  marvelous  stupendous  phenomenal  you understand what im getting at. it is a true tale of friendship and love. its an adventure all throughout  not only for the protagonists but the viewers. the effort put into the whole thing is just shocking. each movie was released one year apart of the other and theyre all over 3 hours long. the script is great and so is the directing and everything else. there is no way this trilogy can disappoint. definitely worth the eleven hours you put into watching it.the shawshank redemption is an aesthetic adaptation of a much repeated clichÍ© where theres a will theres a way. it is a monumental piece of art that can chill thrill excite and rejoice any type of audience. it renders a remarkable story of hope trust courage determination and friendship while at the same time exploring the not-so-pleasant themes of corruption and police brutality. it tells a story of andy dufresne played by tim robbins a banker who is falsely accused of murdering two people. it shows andys prison life as he tries to adopt to his harsh surroundings while at the same time developing a close bond with an aging but active inmate played by morgan freeman and his comrades. as the story develops andy rises in popularity as the warden himself starts using andy for his private business. the film offers a commendable soundtrack brilliant cinematography and an astounding storyline. both tim robbins and morgan freeman are exceptional in their performances moreover bob gunton also gives a brilliant performance of the villainous warden. on the whole this film offers its viewers a kind of emotional enlightenment a kind which forces every viewer to reevaluate his stance on his life and goals. a must watch 10/10the shawshank redemption is a timeless story of heartbreak deception and ultimate growth under the most deplorable conditions. the acting is superior some of tim robbins and morgan freemans best work as they allow me an intimate look inside the sometimes contradictory nature of a convicts existence where i am torn emotionally between danger and safety light and shadow sanity and sorrow truth and lies injustice and justice. in fact i am lost in all the actors poignant and memorable portrayals of young thugs cruel guards swindlers thieves rapists and murders all standing in their respective spaces quietly listening together to an operatic aria over a loudspeaker on the prison yard. in this movie i find almost no one to be all good or all bad. there are exceptions though. although there are those in charge of the prison i wish to be caught in a snare of their own making or worse there are still others behind prison walls that turn out to be heroes i cheer on to win in the end. like people in real life most of the characters in the shawshank redemption both prisoners and guards those that are not miserably rotten to the bone represent many shades of gray. one of the most touching moments in the shawshank redemption is a scene in which an elderly convict who has spent the better part of his adult life locked up is brokenheartedly paroled into a modern world that is as alien to him as his outdated suit and boyhood memories. and his fear of this new and unnatural terrain crawling with shadier creatures than those he had known behind bars and the exhaust fumes of a thousand horseless carriages rushing past engulfed him with no hope of ever escaping. fear can hold you prisoner. hope can set you free from the shawshank redemption. as bonds form between people of different ethnic groups economic backgrounds and intellectual levels i rejoice in their discovery of the human dignity they share. as the story unfolds my heart hurts so hard i cry. then with tears still in my eyes i laugh the same way my family used to laugh together at dinner or a movie when i was a little girl. getting older. times changing. people leaving. dying. but at the core of the main characters spirit there shines upon all those who are within its range including me a contagious hope eternal. i am still astonished with the euphoria that fills my being each time i view this incredible story about the invincible human spirit.the shawshank redemption is a story of life itself. it is not about a person in prison it is about the soul and the battle it accepts and carries on to deserve the life it has been given by god. i watched the movie for the first time some months ago. that evening i was about to go out with some friends but out meeting was canceled and i had to stay home. being unhappy about that i started watching the movie on the tv just by chance not knowing about its existence before that at all. at first i was skeptic i admit that. but oh god at the end of it i was screaming and jumping in my room at 1 am it gave me so much emotions and so much hope i had never felt before that. i could hardly believe that a movie could make me feel that way - so excited so happy about my life leaving me believing so much in my own self. it is a great story of what the strength of your thoughts can make you do. in the shawshank redemption desire does not make you weak just the opposite - gives you wings to fly away from fear fly closer and closer to freedom. morgan freemans voice is just another advantage that makes the movie even more impressive. tim robbins act is just beyond perfection i bought the dvd this summer and every time i feel weak or just bad about something i watch the movie. it has become my personal shrink making me feel strong enough anytime i watch it. can never imagine a better movie made anywhere in the world even after 1000 yearsthe shawshank redemption is a movie that will really never ever be forgotten. arguably the best movie of all time. a thundering reassurance in the hope for a better tomorrow this movie is truly an epitome of hope and perseverance. probably should be filed under the category of movies you should watch anyhow before you die. true masterpiece. there wont be another movie that can be quite anything like this. this movie is so powerful that i cant even describe this in a few words. this is the kind of movie that rekindles hopes in all of us. the kind of movie that will always keep moving and impressing generations to come. with a storyline that not only will blow you away but also strengthen your hopes and faith in the fact that hope is a good thing. maybe the best of things. and no good thing ever dies.the shawshank redemption is a movie that creates a sense of mystery and power. tim robbins and morgan freeman carry the movie by displaying their roles as best friends. after watching that movie for the first time i remembered clips that are drilled into my mind forever. it is beautifully written and directed. the scene that sticks out to me is at the end of the movie when andy dufresne and ellis boyd red redding reunite at the end of the movie. this promotes the aspect of friendship that will live on forever. even though these two men have lived in prison for years they eventually got out well andy escaped and they still managed to find one of the most important things in their lives each other. i recommend this movie to all ages. although this movie may be a complex the first time you watch it but after several other times it still creates a sense of thrill and hope for the viewers. 10 out of 10the shawshank redemption is a movie about time patience and loyalty -- not sexy qualities perhaps but they grow on you during the subterranean progress of this story which is about how two men serving life sentences in prison become friends and find a way to fight off despair.the shawshank redemption is a brilliant film that is beautifully acted with and insbiring and uplifting message message of hope. in my opinion the film should have at least one oscar to show for its brilliance. it is truly sad that know one could see how superior shawshank is to the wearisome forest gump. i think that if shawshank had been released more recently it would have hands down won best picture it is one of the few films that are worthy of being called perfectthe shawshank redemption is a magnificent tale of friendship and hope. led by great acting all around it is a almost flawless movie. morgan freeman is at his best in this film. this has been my favorite movie since i was a teenager and i think its going to last a while. the movie as a whole is incredible but the ending is what made the movie my favorite. after watching shawshank i was unable to think for several hours. the movie put me in a trance that consisted of me just taking in what i have watched. i have never witnessed such an incredible ending to anything in the movie industry. a must see for anyone who enjoys a good movie i promise it will not disappoint.the shawshank redemption is a brilliant movie with a fantastic and inspired story linebased off a short story by stephen king and a terrific and truly inspired casttheir isnt very much not to like about this movie.it is currently number one on the imdb top 250i definitely dont think it deserves to be number onethe godfather is betterbut i do think it deserves to be high up on the list.tim robbins is great in this moviebut morgan freeman is the really star.anyone who likes crime dramas and prison break movies will love this movie andy dufresne tim robbins is sentenced to two lifetimes in prison when he is framed who killing his wife and her secret lover.he is miserable but soon makes a good friend in the wise red morgan freeman.the shawshank redemption did not win best picture because it will remain to be an example of how a movie does not need to win some sort of award top be considered one of the most prolific experiences an acting production can make someone go through. this is not just a movie...its an experience that everyone need to partake in. i have maybe only seen about 450-500 major motion pictures with about 80% of them being produced after 1980 but this is the only movie out of all where i actually forget these are actors acting in front of a camera with a movie crew. do you know what that means --it means not only frank darabont but every single person involved in this film fused so well that they truly made a piece of artwork that puts people in such an emotional trance they forget whats happening for 2 hours. this is what every director and person who works in the film business dreams about...making a movie this groundbreaking. the shawshank redemption will show you how true friendship can arise from anywhere...even in a prison--where people fear the most to be in. --maybe it shows the intrinsic drive humans have to create a social bond in any situation. sometimes when i talk about this movie to people i feel really disturbed when someone has not seen it. i feel like saying are you insanethe shawshank redemption came out in 1994 and was an absolute flop but found its real audience in home video peaking as the most rented video of 1995 in the usa. a wonderful film that takes you into the prison experience of redmorgan freeman and andy tim robbins. andy being a banker convicted of murder and red a murderer already serving time this movie takes you to the limits of human endurance where the human spirit eventually prevails. the tsr takes you on an emotional journey that you will remember for a long time thanks to the superb crafting of the film and sincere performances by the cast. the  is deep and haunting this film is for the ages and will permenantly have a place in my heart. to me it is the best film of the 90s and quite possibly one of the best of all time. the fact that this film is sitting at no.2 is a testament to just how many people love this film many viewers seem to have an emotional bond with the film and i dont blame them. i only wish that i could view the film for the first time again and experience that redeeming feeling andy and red experienced at the end. ignore the hype surrounding the film and judge it on your own experience the last half hour are especially beautiful. watch this if you already havent and enjoy the masterpiece that frank darabont has so gracefully given us the privilege of viewing. 10/10the shawshank redemption as a film is the most powerful and moving films i have seen and regard it as the best of all time yes there are many grate film out there many that are over looked by many people but as this film has shown box office ratings mean very little in the grand stage time a film that ca be classed as a true classic is one like this thats stands the test of time with grate acting and filming this one move people in ways other films can only hope to do. an it transcends all ages and class with a true hart felt tale of two men over coming adversity in a truly horrible place like the shawshank prison in this way it moves me to think how would i cope in that place if i could at all stand that kind of life for that long but it has a lighter side to it as andy get one over the worden and escapes the cells to freedomthe sequel to batman begins received much hype and delivered more than what was expected.with fast-paced action an awesome plota great hero and a menacing villain.it was a battle of the brains in which the jokerheath ledgerultimately won causing batmanchristian bale to accidentally kill harvey dentaaron eckhartaka.two-face.ledger produces his memorable performance winning an oscar.also starring gary oldmanmaggie gyllenhaal. n.b not for kids -ambrose amituanai sydney australiathe second part of the trilogy of christopher nolan batman is definitely the best movie based on a superhero already made. and it has it all great characters and actors visual and sound incredible atmosphere and a dash up to all of the above. as much as you disappoint the previous installments of batman do not stop viewing the work of nolan. only the new installment of superman man of steel or the third part of the trilogy of batman can approach this huge film. finally especially mention the great performance worthy of an oscar the sadly departed heath ledger in the role of the joker which makes even forget the previous joker batman jack nicholson.the rock n roll packaging is a spoonful of sugar for this movies theme: damnation or redemption every character is either redeemed from their sins or damned for them  theyre either angels or devils or souls beset by the latter and in dire need of the former to show them the way out but who would care if pf hadnt been so well written directed produced or even acted in the first place the return of the king was possibly the most-anticipated film ever the previous two installments of the lord of the rings having instantly ingrained themselves on the movie going publics consciousness. personally i held little fear that the film would fall victim to the dreaded cinematic condition of sequelitis and fail to live up to expectation. but only the actual release of the movie an agonising year after the two towers would remove this uncertainty and fulfill my desire to see on the big screen the end of one of the great stories. as with the fellowship of the ring i need not have concerned myself. as a spectacle the return of the king is by far the most impressive of peter jacksons landmark trilogy. unfortunately like ttt it has flaws but fortunately these are not fatal. jacksons great triumph is that even with all its cgi wonders his film does not neglect its characters in particular the relationships between gandalf and pippin eowyn and theoden and of course frodo and sam. each resonates in the memory. even in the midst of battle jackson focuses on the people into which he has invested so much time and care. its a shame hollywood in general is blind to the possibility of overwhelming spectacle co-existing with the human element of cinema. the intercutting between the battle in front of the black gate and the desperate struggles at the crack of doom is just stunning with the expressions on the faces of the each of the fellowship members underlining what a tour-de-force of storytelling this movie is. the relationship of frodo and sam becomes the centrepiece of the movie more and more as it goes on. this is the way it should be because their parting at the grey havens is the last act of the story. jackson shows that his sensitivity to tolkien is still there in spite of the harsh verdicts of many who disapprove of the changes from book to film. ironically the clamour of too many endings by those who hadnt read the book demonstrates why the earlier changes had to be made. a lot of story had to go into this movie but this is necessary for the following reasons. in ttt there is a convenient pause in the story between helms deep and the isengard reunion. after pippin looks into the palantir the momentum is unbroken in the fotr movie until the end of the great battle inside and outside minas tirith. thus a great deal of ttt book narrative was still to be shown because the movie of ttt left out many of the last chapters. there was no place for the voice of saruman chapter at the end of ttt because in cinematic terms it would have been too anticlimactic but more about that later. also jackson really has no option but to put frodos and sams fights with shelob and the battles for gondor at the same stage of the movie. this makes so much more sense than separating them and having to handle a buildup in tension then the shelob fight then another tension buildup before the great battle for gondor. the structure of the movie would have been too cumbersome. anyway when tolkiens chronology in the appendices is read you realise both events happen at nearly the same time. the worst consequence of the packing of so much narrative into this movie is the underwritten character of denethor. he is totally unsympathetic which is a mistake because in the book he is much more interesting. jackson should have found a way to include denethors struggle with sauron through the palantir because this is the real reason for denethors madness. in this film the cause is his grief over boromirs death which also partly explains his treatment of faramir but this sells the character of denethor short. not only that but also the death of denethor is perhaps jacksons worst error of judgement. the fiery 100 yard dash and plunge over the edge is just ridiculous. there is nothing wrong with the arrival of the army of the dead to win the battle but its just not as stirring as the end of helms deep battle. the high point of rotks battles is the charge of the rohirrim and their fight against the mumakil ie giant elephants which tends to make the actual of end of the battle a let down. wisely jackson does not focus on the green tide washing over saurons hordes instead he cuts back to miranda ottos wonderfully passionate portrayal of eowyn killing the witch-king then throws in the now-famous single-handed bringing down of a mumakil by who else legolas of course. no discussion of this movie should neglect the extended edition dvd. possibly the greatest flaw in the theatrical version of rotk is the omission of the voice of saruman scene and insertion of a silly misleading line of gandalf that saruman had lost his power. but unfortunately as with the omission of the sons of denethor scene at osgiliath in ttt the scene breaks the flow of the movie too much and given the three hour plus running time this decision was understandable. as with ttt jackson is given a get out of jail card by the ee on which sarumans demise can be seen for the first time. i am sorry to say that i was not as generally impressed by the rotk ee as i was by the ees of fotr and ttt. jackson is too self-indulgent with gimlis character. in the theatrical version of rotk i didnt mind these gags but in the paths of the dead scene in particular i found that gimlis antics spoiled the mood of horror and dread that should have been maintained. all of that being said the ee still deserves the highest recommendation. it adds many important details such as eowyn and faramir falling in love. the lotr movie experience is incomplete without it.the return of the king is the third and final film in the lord of the rings saga. peter jacksons portrayal of the film is a masterpiece in an already stunning trilogy. rotk is an epic tale of sacrifice courage and friendship. frodo and sams journey to mount doom is scary and filled with heart breaking moments of triumph and defeat. elijah woods once again portrays frodo wonderfully as well as sean astin. the rest of the fellowship are very good in all of their scenes especially viggo mortenson and ian mckellan as gandalf. visually the cities and battles are simply fantastic and very realistic. this has been a long journey of film starting with the fellowship 2 years ago and now it has ended wonderfully.the return of the king is the spectacular finale to the already fantastic first two movies in the lord of the rings trilogy. this one is the best. aragorn takes the lead role this time as he faces his destiny to become the king of gondor. gollum motion-captured andy serkis is becoming a big problem for sam sean astin as frodo is beginning to trust the creature more than sam himself. and pippin billy boyd pledges his allegiance to denethor john noble the crabby and evil stand-in leader of gondor. denethor doesnt have the best attitude in the world such as when he tries to burn his own son alive. the ending is very long but it isnt bad. the entire movie is riveting magical cinema and i ate up every minute of it. the return of the king is a masterpiece and of course it grossed hundreds of millions no doubt more than that actually. 4/4the return of the king is the best movie ever made to the best trilogy ever done. this movie deserved the eleven oscars it got including the editing. without the editing this movie wouldve been over four hours long. even though this movie is about three and a half hours it dies not feel like it. the scenes are intense and can tend to be emotional. gollum is the show-stealer again. as the ring is taking frodo away from strength gollum uses that to get the ring back eventually and drive sam away. it was kind of sad to see gollum die along with the ring in the fires of mt.doom. aragorn deserves to be king of gondor. he was amazing in this movieplayed by viggo mortensen. i am glad that legolas and gimli were used for comedy. with all the drama and action there needs to be a bit of comedy before the action overwhelms the movie. the acting is perfect. i liked most of the characters. it was sad when theoden died. he was great in this series. the music by howard shore is even better. you can hear some celtic tunes during some scenes. i loved the song into the west by annie lennox. the effects and the cgi is excellent especially during the battle scenes towards the end. peter jackson really put his name into the record books. this is the best fantasy epic in fact the best movie of all time. i rate this movie 15/10if the rating system went any higher.the return of the king is my favorite movie. it concludes a marvelous trilogy directed by the genie peter jackson  this last opus has absolutely everything a spectator can dream of: incredible special effects that even in 50 years wont seem outdated actors that believe in the story they are telling us if you check the dvds bonus youll see how all actors were deeply attached to their characters music that will lift you up to the clouds a story certainly inspired by tolkiens books but still really catchy but in another hand jackson edited the books to make movies even more interesting and i could go on and on and on ... congratulations to all the ones that have contributed to the making of this film the return of the king is a film full of ambition. that is what truly sets this film apart from so many similar fantasy adventures. the scope and scale of this film was enormous i do not think that there has ever been a film made with one quite as large as this one and im not sure there will ever be another. though not only is return of the king a true epic through and through it also has a ton of drama. this film has so much emotional resonance and it achieves this by simply playing off of these wonderful characters and who they truly are. when sam picks frodo up and carries him up the slope of mount doom one would almost feel their eyes begin to tear up. this film is not only a terrific actioner but it is also a beautiful film that might even force the more hardened moviegoers to shed a tear before all is said and done. when it is over there is no denying that the return of the king is one of the greatest achievements ever captured on film. i give the return of the king a perfect 10 out of 10the plot is simple but hard to explain it is basically a story telling the intertwining lives of two mob hit men a gangster a gangsters wife a boxer and two robbers this film has a fantastic cast from john travolta samuel l jackson bruce willis uma thurman tim roth amanda plummer and ving rhames i think i missed someone out but yeah its a pretty good cast they deliver their lines so naturallythe perfect ending of the best epic movie in the history. do not try to compare the first or the second movie with this you must see it as a 10 hours movie. sorry there is no lord of the rings next year...damm  the film is just a big crazy amusement park. most important to me though and im sure many others would have to be the storys structure. have you ever seen a chronological timeline of the film its crazy. its like when the film is in the correct order it doesnt make sense anymore. it wouldnt fit the film because its too much fun for an a to b. the way quentin tarantino weaved the films content together is so extremely impressive because it works so well. the film just flows. the transitions are so fluid. and the story itself is just so interesting that the way it shifts around itself creates so much intrigue and makes it so thrilling. just as integral as the way the story is presented is the characters that present it. vincent jules and butch are really just normal people in the world of pulp fiction but to the viewer theyre so much larger than life. not only do vincent and jules have an unforgettable chemistry as partners but what was really incredible to me was the chemistry vincent and butch had as enemies without even really knowing each other. the conflict between them created by just two encounters is astounding. jules though jules is excellent. a great character played by a great actor. samuel l jackson steals every single scene hes in. his monologues are legendary. this man must have needed some great vengeance and furious anger to be able to deliver those lines the way he did. he was one bad mother. i remember seeing parts of the film as a kid and wondering what the rest of it would be like. i thought seeing the whole movie would be like opening pandoras box on my concept of what a movie could be. looking back i think i was right. the path of the rigtheous man... when you hear this im sure you still get the chills. the best 90s movie because of the plot because of the changes that tarantino made in the perception of time in films. because of the astonishing performances of everyone in the cast. because of the soundtrack... a movie that nobody will ever forget.the opening sequence which most people have seen online due to the footage being shown on some trailer reels sets the stage for the entire film. an eerie  brilliant directing and spot on acting. there isnt too much that i feel comfortable saying about this film that hasnt already been said a thousand times and wouldnt give anything away. i will tell you that the joker is incredible. the trailers thankfully dont really give away too much of heath ledgers incredible acting so i recommend seeing it for yourself. a lot of people are complaining about the length of the film but the film covers a lot of ground and shortening it would be murder. go see this while you can its a classic and raises the bar for all super hero films.the muchanticipated interstellar arrived and immediately created massive explosions both on film and in

of my film rants follow me on twitter calcium_wastethe movies does a solid job of defying reality by fiction and engaging people with such perfection that a pure super-heroic fiction film gets more than just fiction. the directions so perfect action so realistic performances like never seen before music to die for  awesome cinematography omg its superb. the dialouges feels so crafted and well defined and the joker is flawless. chris has done a brilliant job  and the whole cast is brilliant. with the usual real world scenarios and talksit shows the unexcepted and awesomely scripted every scene that you wont get bored even if you are a not so die-hard batman fan or something. marvel superheroes those lame iron man and thor should learn from this  not forced like so many other actors. tim robbins displays his acting ability beautifully and captures the audience with an intense amount of emotion which seems to resonate in his eyes. the genius and wisdom of the character he portrays is a fascinating thing to watch unfold as the story lays itself out like a poster of rita hayworth. to say that this movie gives the audience hope would be unfair because this movie makes the audience want to live love experience life for all of its pleasures and its faults. it makes one appreciate the simple things and slow down a bit to admire that which we pass a hundred times a day but never truly see. to describe this movie as great would be an understatement because it is so much more than that. while it is brutal and realistic it portrays humanity at our best and our worst providing the audience with a mirror in which to reflect what lies within. by the time the credits roll were left speechless...and at the same time wanting to share this masterpiece with those we love and cherish. everyone should see this movie at least once in a lifetime to make us appreciate everything we have. who would have thought someone could capture humanity this way i guess a picture really is worth a thousand words...... the movie was spectacular. the trilogy cannot be described in any word nor any string of words put together to form a phrase or anything else. it was unbelievably impressive. starting with the movie once again the acting was phenomenal. the emotion evoked and the empathy one feels for the characters is truly sincere. its amazing at how a movie can be four hours long yet not feel as if it was more than three or two and a half. the visual effects are incredible. the trilogy as a whole is unbelievablethe movie was great and the acting of christian bale was out of this world.i think he is the best actor of present era. the story line of movie was great. the only shortcoming that i see is when they attack the city and the scenery they show of city is not very good  very suffocating. beside this the movie was great.the movie has live up to the expectation. the message given in the film is very good. i want to salute the guy who have written the dialog of this batman movie series. the dialogue are just amazing and their delivery is killing. you want to hear the dialogs again and again . believe me. the gadgets of the batman are amazing. i specially like to talk about the caretaker of wayne house. mr. pennyworth he has done his role very effectively. in the nutshell  the movie is great and totally worth your money.the movie was directed by quentin tarantino and is considered to be a turn in the history of hollywood cinema it was released on 14th october 1995 and maintains its position #5 in imdbs top 250 list ever since the great thing about this movie is the its non-linear storyline which keeps the audience interested it revolves around the lives of two mob hit men a boxer a gangsters wife and a pair of diner bandits intertwine in four tales of violence and redemption the thing that most amused me is long duration continuous shots and the brilliant acting done by samuel l jackson john travolta and uma thurman this movie has some great all time favorite dialog like i dare you i double dare you and many more the music in the movie is great as it very well keeps the pace and rhythm of the movie and keeps viewers interested coming to the composition of the movie the sudden movement of space and time is very well composed and directed the movie starts from present goes into the past then jumps to future and comes back to the present this is very well crafted so that the audience do not get confused coming to awards and nominations it won an oscar for the best writing and screenplay and got numerous nominations for best picture best actor best actor in the supporting role best director and many more overall it won 62 awards and 46 nominations and an oscar which is a sign of great movie so i would like to conclude by saying that it is indeed a great movie to watch with good plotacting and direction and one should watch it at least oncethe movie that shot director quentin tarantino into popularity pulp fiction still stands as his greatest movie and one of the best movies ever created the film follows multiple inter-connecting plot lines: samuel l jackson and john trovolta play two hit men searching for a stolen briefcase uma thurman plays the boss mans wife out on a date with trovolta bruce willis plays a boxer on the run from gangsters ands tim roth and amanda plummer play a couple robbing a diner the plot is structured brilliantly and is told out of order which makes things even more interesting the film features most tarantino trademarks including his normal chunky dialogue with some of the most quotable lines in any film ever contained here the films also not shy on action and theres loads of surprises throughout the moviealthough i wont spoil anything acting wise pulp fiction features one of the greatest casts in film history jackson gives what is undoubtedly the best performance of his career as the bible spouting hit man while trovolta gives another great performance in the role that resurrected his career thurman also acts brilliantly as the sexy but mysterious wife to the main mafia boss the supporting cast is strong with harvey keitel playing the gangster expert and even tarantino himself has a small but hilarious role but thats not the only reason pf is so great its everything about it the soundtrack is classic tarantino with tons of pop culture tunes used to add to the story while the camera work is some of the best since the films release and the film just keeps on giving from its smart opening scene which carries the whole movie to its hilarious middle acts to its hugely satisfying conclusion as it stands pulp fiction is still one of the funniest darkest most enjoyable and most creative films ever if you havent seen the film yet then i cant recommend enough you go out and watch it as soon as you can a true classicthe movie is one of my favorite movie. it was unfortunate that i didnt see it in the big screenthe movie is all what i expect and imagine from the book excellent effects actors direction photography is amazing..the music... i have no words... the movie has a amazing develop from the first movie so this is the most involving but the end although the length is ... well.. from usa today: the three-part story of courage friendship honor and duty _„î spanning the fellowship of the ring 2001 the two towers 2002 and the return of the king which comes to theaters tonight _„î is ideally suited to epic film-making. it is steeped in fast-paced action and grand adventure yet still grounded in humanity _„î a rare combination among large-scale film extravaganzas. it isnt until now that director peter jacksons efforts can be fully and fairly judged notwithstanding the monumental box office success of the first two films which have grossed $1.8 billion worldwide. as good as each individual movie is the third film vaults the work into the stratosphere of classic movies. key characters are enhanced new civilizations visited and battles fought more intensely while feelings and motivations are plumbed more deeply and movingly. after the release of the first and second films one wondered how the trilogy as a nine-hour film fest might compare with other cinematic watermarks. in its entirety the lord of the rings surpasses other multi-part sagas such as star wars or even the godfather. both star wars and the godfather had weak links whole movies that didnt work as well as the best of the series. rings maintains the same standard of excellence with each film and grows more assured with each installment. of course some of that escalating power is attributable to the storytelling prowess of j.r.r. tolkien upon whose classic novels the trilogy is based. the books depict the odyssey of the humble hobbit frodo whose quest is to destroy a powerful ring that could enslave all the inhabitants of the fictional land of middle-earth. helping him accomplish his mission is a heroic cadre of creatures: gandalf the wizardthe movie is absolutely perfect. outstandingly acted and perfectly directed by chris nolan. the movies only wrong is the fact that the character of harvey dent/two face isnt given enough time to develop his psychological state. heath ledger steals the show and stands out as the best actor in the bunch. the movie gets better and better every time i watch it. it not only surpasses batman begins - previously considered the high-water mark of movies about the dark knight - but one that magnificently transcends the superhero genre. even if this wasnt ledgers final role before his untimely death last year his joker would still go down in cinema history as one of the most creepily unhinged big-screen bad guys of all time. lets put a smile on that face.the movie is about the fall of two heroes - gothams unofficial hero and gothams real hero. im talking about the dark knight and harvey dent. this amazing movie shows how easy its to fall to the dark side what harvey dent did. aaron eckhart is great in this role and heath ledger really shows what acting is.i really love heath ledger for his portrayal of the joker his best role. but unfortunately he past away and he got a oscar post-morten. the question if he really deserved the academy award is hard to answer he had a lot of really amazing competitors. im afraid to say too much in this review so my best tip is to buy it on blu-ray or dvd and watch it i promise you youll love it.the movie gone girl is about a man named nick dunne whose wife amy is missing on their fifth wedding anniversary then a while later they suspect that nick dunne killed his wife the movie is excellent and oscar worthy especially for rosamund pike and david fincher the movie is the best thriller of all time in my opinion it grabs your attention thanks to screenwriter and author gilliam flynn the movie has a great cast with a brilliant story that is suspenseful the theme of the movie is dark and creepy to intense more people throughout the movie this movie should be number 1 of the top 250 movies of all time it at least needs to get to 9510the movie experience of the decade for me comes via pulp fiction when it opened on opening day to little fanfare or hype i asked my friends if theyd want to go none did so i went by myself and had the most spiritual film experience of my life thus far im 24 electric sharp masterfully crafted and an incredible screenplay only tap the beginning as to how i feel about this masterpiece pulp fiction is why god created filmthe movie begins with batman and lt. jim gordon closing in on the organized crime groups and leaders. in gotham the gangs are united because of the presence of batman. he put tracers on the money of the gangs to see its flow so that it will be easier to catch the leaders. these gangs have a chinese national as their accountant and money launderer. he takes all of their money out of the banks to keep the money safe before the police get it. this plan works well because the police went to the banks and the money was gone. their accountant lou also left the country to avoid any charges against him. then the joker crashes the gangs meeting offering to kill batman for half of their money. all the leaders said that the joker was ridiculous but once batman brought lou from china to the police the leaders gave the joker access to all the man and utilities. the joker wages war against batman by trying to lure out the man under the mask by killing innocent people. the batman was ready to come out in a conference when suddenly the new district attorney harvey dent said he was batman. the joker then tried to kill dent but the batman hid him. in the aftermath the joker took dents girlfriend rachel who happens to be batmans ex-girlfriend and threw her out a window. this exposed the batmans weakness for rachel because he jumped out after her. the joker then takes dent and rachel and on opposite sides of the city and puts them in a room full of explosive with enough time for batman to save one. the batman decides to go after dent who burns half of his face in the explosion which means rachel died. dent was furious with the batman and started to hate the world. the joker paid him a visit in the hospital and convinced him to blame the world. the batman captures the joker and is called to assist lt. gordon in saving his family from harvey dent. while saving the son of gordon batman kills dent. he decides to take all the blame on himself to keep hope in the city. the joker makes the dark knight a must watch film because he becomes the greatest villain of all time. joker is a great super villain because he has no motive for his actions. in the opening scene you can see that the joker is a mastermind. he plans a bank robbery second by second and in this job he kills all of the robbers that he hired to be left with all the money. some argue that this is contradictory later in the movie where he burns money to show he does not care about the money. in reality the joker planned this job to show the police that there is a new villain in gotham. the joker wants batman to kill him knowing that the batman will not kill because justice will not be done. the joker draws focus on the batman throughout the movie but in the end the unpredicted happens. the joker shows batman that his plan was to turn dent the notorious new district attorney being praised as the white knight into a villain. the joker does not want fame money or revenge. he simply wants to show the world that all people have their dark side but they chose to be good. the joker knows exactly what to say to trigger people to react in a fit of rage and he knows exactly how to react in that situation. a villain should be terrifying in every scene and the joker is a prime example of this. when he walks in on all of the gangs leaders meeting and is approached with opposition he opens his jacket to reveal about 6 grenades wired. he does not care about his life let alone anybody others. one of the most memorable qualities about the joker is his scars. in the movie we never learn how he actually received them. every time he brings up the scars the reasoning changes to apply to the person but later he ends up scarring the people to match him. heath ledger picked up a habit of flicking his tongue while trying to figure out the best was to portray the joker and the little tongue flip in between the sentences make him seem creepier and builds suspense. at one scene the joker is in the middle of the road crippled with the batman speeding violently straight at the joker. the jokers reaction is surprising instead of trying to avoid the batman he stands and is calling for batman to kill him. i can picture that scene now the joker chanting and later screaming come on. come on. i want you to do it. come on hit me hit me that scene shows that the joker is fearless which in return makes him unpredictable and suspenseful. a villain that is asking for death knowing that if batman kills him that batman will become a vigilante. in conclusion the joker is successful in flipping the one time unstoppable incorruptible district attorney harvey dent into a villain. this causes batman to choose to let all of the peoples hopes and dreams of a brighter future die with dent or should the story be flipped turning the batman into the cities most hated man. the jokers success in making the batman have to go into hiding means that he accomplished what he wanted which makes him the greatest villain. heath ledgers role as the joker won 32 best supporting character awards. ledgers acting and presentation of the joker is unmatched. the joker became the greatest villain of all time in the dark knight.the most fantastic movie ive seen its going to be considered classic even 100yrs from now a must watch cult movie that can teach actors and filmmakers the real way to make great art i have watched this movie tons of times and each time i watch it i get more in depth of what things actually meant also reservoir of dogs is very recommended one of my most favorite movies of all i am a big fan of filmmaking in general and its very important to watch classics to really put yourself in the mind of the filmmakers at the times when action and horror movies hasnt yet trashed hollywood have fun watching and happy journeythe most amazing thing about this movie is its pioneering spirit they look at night sky and see a map of foreign worlds that need to be visited the movie presents lot of mysteries of the world in visually fascinating way those robots there are amazing as well complete opposite of marvin from hitchhikers guide to the galaxy i love them the emotional layer is as great as it gets you may very well find yourself crying possibly more than once finally the imagination was mind blowing rolling around the edges of the things you are yet willing to accept as possible it all feels very real like you are right there travelling across the universe encountering strangest parts of physicsthe more times you watch it the more you love it and the more you learn from it. an absolutely encouraging story to those who are desperate or sad or complaining about bad luck. if you never give up and try to figure out a way ahead nothing can stop you to the brightness and freedom. everything you have experienced will bring you positive influences if you take it positively. i have watched it for many times at least ten times i guess. now i hope i can download it and keep it and enjoy it once i have time. i used it to encourage people around me for example a girl friend whos suffering from the depression a workmate who has just lost his favorite pet and a friend who lost his job recently.the lord of the rings: the return of the king was an amazing third part of the lord of the rings trilogy. it was good to show the prologue on how smeagol/gollum got the ring. so it was shown that he murdered his own cousin deagol. through this we can all understand on how gollum exactly got the ring. if it hadnt for the prologue we could have just thought that gollum got it by himself. but no what happened was deagol got it first and stolen by smeagol by killing deagol. the effects made in the three hunters visit to the dimholt road where the ghosts who will answer to the king of gondor is found is wonderful. it was never seen clearly as digitally edited but more life-like. in the battle of pelennor fields it was an amazing scene where thousands of orcs were made through massive a software intended to create multiples of characters. the rohan scenery was great theoden s screenplay during that time was most impressively appropriate for their situation. eowyn also even as a woman acted great by miranda otto in taking down the oliphaunt. i really loved her style. in the part where legolas was told by aragorn to take down the oliphaunt. i love how legolas acted by orlando bloom in that scene. i do not know whether it was digitally edited of his jumping or it was his own stunt. but however it was done it was amazing and stylish in the front of the black gate scene i have seen the extended edition of rotk and the mouth of sauron was exclusively shown. i could have wanted it to be part of the movie but i understand that the movie is rate pg-13 and is needed not to show to much brutality. the part where sam was going to help frodo out i understood that the ring was still tempting frodo. have any of you realized that the ring didnt break out easily it was because it wanted frodo to come after it and save it. but frodo realized to climb up with the help of sam and that was the time that the ring broke because it knew that it will be destroyed once frodo turns his back on it. i love how they interpreted the rings desire into the movie though some may not see it that way. the part where frodo was going to leave for valinor i was sad that part. i even thought to myself why would frodo go but when he said to sam we set out to save the shire sam and it has been saved but not for me. so i realized that frodo as a hero did it not for himself but for his beloved home. the movie was incredibly awesomely greatly amazingly wonderfully beautifully made the crew and cast really made tolkiens work come to life go lotr: rotkthe lord of the rings: the return of the king is the concluding chapter in the lord of the rings trilogy and i must say it concluded amazingly. the movie starts off with a dark backstory of smeagol which when i say dark i mean dark. you see smeagol murder his friend deagol or lover in which you realise how quickly the ring will poison mens minds - even to the point where one would murder a friend to have it. from here you see smeagol deteriorate and become what we know as gollum and its just a really dark segment but it provides a necessary backstory to the character. i must mention that there is one character in this movie that i despise of more than any character i have seen in any movie: denethor boromirs father who pretty much scorns his second born son faramir. its obvious that faramir has been trying to prove his worthiness to his father for some time but when denethor says to his son that he had wished he had died instead of boromir you cant as the viewer help but feel as broken-hearted as faramir. i mean imagine your father said that to you  so gandalf took pippin and rode to minas tirith. meanwhile on the road to the ships that will take elves away from middle earth arwen was thinking over her choice of path. until has a vision of her son that convince her to go home. so she rode home and plead her father to reforge the ancient blade of narsil and give it to her beloved aragorn so he can become the king he was born to be. so overall all three films are excellent. and you know i do feel sorry for faramir being an the unappreciated son i mean it was his big brother boromir who was their dads favorite. i love the developing friendship between merry & eowyn. and i love the end-title song performed by annie lennox. the lord of the rings: the return of the king in my view has to be one of the best if not the bestconclusions to any trilogy in movie making history. when i first heard that peter jackson had begun filming the lotr films i was a little apprehensive as id not long finished reading the books. i thought there was no way hed be able to do them justice and that the films would go the same way as many trilogys had gone before by starting on a high but sadly lacking at the end. my apprehension however was not needed. the return of the king stayed more or less quite true to the books. the size and scale of the battles is immense and the sets scenery and cgis are thoroughly stunning.i cant wait until the extended version comes out on dvd so as to see the bits that had to be omitted due to time constraints. peter jackson can now sit among the big boys of direction and i only hope that if he gets the go ahead for the hobbit it will be made in the same style and panache as the lotr trilogy. i would recommend lord of the rings: return of the king to anyonethe lord of the rings: the return of the king concludes the journey of frodo sam and gollum to the fires of mordor. but while they proceed to mordor gollum has a nasty plan to get back at frodo for supposedly betraying him. and while this is happening pippin merry gandalf aragorn legolas gimli and the rest of the kingdom of rohan learn of saurons plan: to attack the kingdom of gondor for he knows that the heir of isildur aragorn has come back. so begins one of the biggest battles you will see on the screen. i must say this is a great way to end the series. yes its over 3 hours long but its still very good. and this is a film not a movie. a film. there is also much more emotion than in the other ones and you see the deterioration of frodo as the ring takes hold of him. please see this movie because if you think you thought that the first two were damn good you aint seen nothing yet.the lord of the rings: the return of the king brings peter jacksons mammoth adaptation of j.r.r. tolkiens classic to a close in suitably epic fashion. epic fantasy-drama film directed by peter jackson that is based on the second and third volumes of j. r. r. tolkiens the lord of the rings. it is the concluding film in the lord of the rings film trilogy following the fellowship of the ring and the two towers. as sauron launches the final stages of his conquest of middle-earth gandalf the wizard and thÍ©oden king of rohan rally their forces to help defend gondors capital minas tirith from the looming threat. aragorn finally claims the throne of gondor and summons an army of ghosts to help him defeat sauron. ultimately even with full strength of arms they realise they cannot winthe lord of the rings: return of the king is the third and final installment of peter jacksons adaptations of tolkiens famous fantasy novels. once again the makers of the film have taken care with the costumes sets scenery models cgi effects and howard shores epic  to create a convincing depiction of middle earth. once again the cast delivers expert performances. john noble joins the cast as denethor and effectively makes him into a despicable and repugnant character. three of the performances in the film were particularly memorable for me. bernard hill once again brings authority to the role of king theoden and his inspiring presence on the battlefield left me in awe. miranda otto brings strength to the role of eowyn and makes the characters best moments unforgettable. ian mckellen once again brought his commanding presence as gandalf to bear as he tried desperately to hold everything together. this film follows the familiar format of the first two films in taking tolkiens work and streamlining it to create a well-paced film. the famous battle at minas tirith is on an unprecedented scale and the best fantasy battle ever filmed. as with the first two films i found the added scenes for the extended addition interesting but they didnt add much above and beyond the already great theatre cut.the lord of the rings: return of the king is a striking powerful and beautiful film with an amazing storyline. this is the final journey for the fellowship of the ring to complete their mission through battle passion and love. i believe in this film this is where the true relationships of the characters start to form and become strong and meaningful. without spoiling the film for you i will now talk about the soundtrack. for me the soundtrack is at the heart of this film. it is filled with so much emotion i even get teary when listening to it. a brilliant soundtrack along with an amazing story means you get an excellent film. i definitely recommend everyone to watch this although this film requires full concentration so perhaps only watch it when you have time to get the best experience.the lord of the rings was a unique film made by a director and cast that were in tune with the book from which it was taken. it has been a privilege to see all the 3 movies almost impeccably true to the spirit of the book. it is with great anticipation that i look forward to the hobbit to be made in new zealand and know that sir ian mckellan is looking forward to spending a year there reprising his role as gandalfhe has just said so - 20 minutes ago on bbc news. im sure it will be made with the same dedication to detail that marked the sequel lotr.it will be made more enjoyable now i have a large screen with which to view the spectacular scenery of new zealand once again.the lord of the rings trilogy made by peter jackson is easily one of the best fantasy flicks ever made. not only the visual aspect of those three movies surpasses any single fantasy movie to be released before this film but also the story was magical captivating and unforgettable with great characters excellent performances and beautiful music. this was one of the most incredible films ever made i think those three lord of the rings flicks are the greatest achievement in all the history of cinema and the only movie to be almost as good as those movies was avatar from james cameron. the return of the king is the excellent third and lastpart of this great trilogy and shares all the good elements of the two previous film. this movie was excellent from beginning to end being epic emotional and thrilling. the battle scenes were memorable and magnificent: the ending was perfect and closes in a satisfying way one of the greatest movie franchises ever made. this movie is magnificent and it is one of the best flicks ever made.the lord of the rings trilogy are the three greatest films ever madethe lord of the rings the return of the king is an outstanding movie full of everything you could ever ask to be in a movie. there is romance between sam and rosie and aragorn and arwen who almost could not be together because of the war and faramir and eowyn. there is loads of comedy specifically speaking of merry and pippin but also between gimli and legolas when in the fight scenes. my favorite quote of gimlis is always: certainty of death small chance of success what are we waiting for i can not help but include a small giggle no matter what mood i am in. another scene is when legolas just takes on the giant elephaunt with many men in his way and gimli still manages to keep that as one: that still only counts as one this movie is of course action packed. thousands of blood-thirsty orcs completely built for killing march to the gates of minas tirith. after a few blows from the gondor catapults throwing chunks of the city the massive army breaks into the city destroying everything in their path. just as all hope fails aragorn gimli and legolas come to the rescue. of course they couldnt do it alone the three heroes come to the rescue with a massive army behind them. what kind of army you may ask a dead army. the deadly army of the dead joined forces with aragorn to assure their own freedom. the true meaning of the movie however is friendship. in the darkest times of middle earth 2 hobbits had what everyone in the world could have. each other or their own friendship. it seems as though the only hope in the world which they were lied with these two hobbits who berally knew how to wield a sword. carrying the one ring and each other frodo baggins and sam gamgee finally save middle earth and rid the world of its evil inhabitants just by keeping hope in front of them and holding on to each other. basically their faith in each other and their friendship saved all of middle earth. i hope that you enjoy this movie as much as i did.the lord of the rings is without doubt the most epic and staggering film undertaking of all time. how peter jackson pulled it off i will never know maybe he used one of gandalfs enchantments rarely throughout the 12 hour epic is there a bad scene or a dull moment every scene has had so much thought and hard work poured into it. from the writing to the production crew to the acting to the sceneryto the music oh god i love the musicand just everybodys determination to pull this near impossible feat off even fantasy haters would have to admit their amazement. never has a movie given me so many spine tingly moments and scenes of such beauty that they nearly push me to tears. peter jackson seemed so blessed with good fortune viggo mortensens last minute replacement says it all it was as if the spirit of tolkien himself was guiding it along. as i see this as one whole movie i wont be reviewing just the return of the king. i saw the first film the fellowhip of the ring when i was 12 and im 21 now and i still havent been more absorbed by a movie in the cinema and i doubt i ever will. the transition from the innocence and lightness of the shire at the start to the dark epic of the quest later is nothing short of brilliant. i think fellowship is my favourite of the three it goes through the most development and felt the most satisfying. the whole mines of moria sequence is my standout moment of the entire trilogy. to the battle with the cave troll and the escape from the balrog it is exhilarating involving and most of all - emotional. the two towers has the hardest task of being the middle film but it more than rises to the challenge. it drops you straight into the action and doesnt hold up. the rohan sequences are the best bits of the film culminating in the battle of helms deep which to me is the most personal and intense battle of the trilogy. the creation of gollum was revolutionary through cgi and motion capture never has a computerised character seemed so real. the return of the king delivers the emotional finale we all hoped it would. i remember sitting in the cinema hearing all sorts of sobbing all around me during the climax on mount doom. there are so many stand-out moments in this movie but the one i will mention is the charge of the rohirrim. this scene actually pushed me to tears on first viewing not because it was sad but because it was so... awesome. i was so happy when this film won 11 oscars it more than deserved it i was hoping it would win more than 11 but oh well. any gripes i have for the trilogy would be the portrayal of its big bad sauron and considering that sauron is the centre of the lord of the rings this is definitely a problem. if there was one thing from the books that is unfilmable it is definitely sauron. how do you portray a villain that hardly appears and any descriptions of him there are are so vague and surreal is sauron a big flaming eye or did he have a physical form this is never made clear in the books and poses a big obstacle for film where the audience needs to see their villain. peter jackson and co do the best they can with the material and chose to literally portray sauron as the big flaming eye. however this is not enough to satisfy especially during the climax of return of the king where the dark lord is basically a lighthouse the films make the mistake of bigging sauron up through the films and ultimately it fizzles out by the end which is a real shame. as you can tell from what i have said i love the lord of the rings and i would say it is my favourite film of all time. no other film has moved me as much as this and given me so many different emotions from fear to sadness to laughter. i honestly couldnt imagine anyone else playing the characters it was if they were made for them. the actors all generally had a special relationship with one another and with peter jackson just watch the extras and that what you are watching on screen is genuine. it was almost to the point that the actors werent working so hard out of professionalism but out of love and devotion to mr.jackson. hardly any other films can claim they had this kind of magic behind the camera. honourable mentions will be given to ian mckellen as gandalf viggo mortensen as aragorn and elijah wood as frodo i felt these three literally became the characters they were playing but of course there are countless others to mention but i dont have time. howard shores  is possibly the best movie  ever and the films would be nothing without it. ultimately say what you will hardcore tolkien fans about the films you cannot deny that they did so much for tolkiens greatest work and made it one of the most recognisable stories in the world. if you have somehow not seen these films first of all slap yourself and secondly go buy the extended editions as these are the true versions of the films and include many great scenes that were cut - especially the return of the king which had many vital scenes cut aka. sarumans last hoorah and gandalf confronting the witch king. peter jackson i salute you and new zealandthe lord of the rings is an epic high fantasy novel written by english philologist and university of oxford professor j. r. r. tolkien. the story began as a sequel to tolkiens 1937 childrens fantasy novel the hobbit but eventually developed into a much larger work. it was written in stages between 1937 and 1949 much of it during world war ii. it is the second best-selling novel ever written with over 150 million copies sold. the title of the novel refers to the storys main antagonist the dark lord sauronwho had in an earlier age created the one ring to rule the other rings of power as the ultimate weapon in his campaign to conquer and rule all of middle-earth. from quiet beginnings in the shire a hobbit land not unlike the english countryside the story ranges across northwest middle-earth following the course of the war of the ring through the eyes of its characters the hobbits frodo baggins samwise sam gamgee meriadoc merry brandybuck and peregrin pippin took but also the hobbits chief allies and traveling companions: the men aragorn a ranger of the north and boromir a captain of gondorthe lord of the rings is an amazingly powerful visual experience. not even just a visual experience. peter jackson has crafted one of the finest written pieces of our era into the quintessential epic. he supplements the brilliant storytelling of jrr tolkien with one of the most awe-inspiring collection of films ever created t is one of the masterpieces delivered by the legendary director peter jackson.the film takes us to the final part of the journey of the hobbit master frodo baggins and his friend samwise gamgee to the rough and dry evil land of mordor to the mount doom to destroy the ring made by the evil lord sauron.this movie completely grasps you and amazes you alongwith inspiring you and giving a simple yet important message that with courage you can achieve anything as was done by frodo and thus disproving the phrase nobody simply walks into mordor.legendary actor sir ian mckellen completely justified the with the role of gandalf.elijah wood as frodo baggins and viggo mortensen as aragorn has delivered the performances of their lives. as a film though this is amazing. a true lasting legacy in story telling and now cinemathe lord of the rings ... best trilogy and movie ever made. the cast as they have been all the way are excellent. woods frodo changes well during this film while astin is touching in his portrayal of unerring friendship. bloom and rhys-davis had less to do but came into their own during the battle scenes - adding both action and the odd comic touch that still counts as one being accepted by the audience as a chance to break the tension. mortensen is the title character and serves it well with mckellen also continuing his strong role. i could list through the whole cast but i will stick with noting two things. firstly both monaghan and boyd had bigger and more meaningful roles and rose to them well. secondly i continue with my belief from the second film that serkis is the stand out actor of the trilogy. his gollum is so much more than an effect - he is tragic fearsome hateful and funny. praise of course goes to the special effects for making this character tell so much with an expression but to pretend that the work of the actor is secondary to the character as opposed the look is foolish. he deserved one for two towers so i hope an oscar goes his way. it was a shame to not have screen time for lee but the film works well without him and it was a brave move by the editors.the lord of the rings - the two towers is truly an amazing film and the middle part of the sweeping lord of the rings saga of films by peter jackson. it is obviously very highly rated and critically acclaimed but for whatever reason it is not as loved as the first and third parts of the lord of the rings franchise. the first part obviously sets everything up and begins the journey and part three is all about the climax and resolution with some obviously really huge stuff going on but part two has just as much action. id rank them: part 3 then part 2 then part 1 in order of enjoyment and how much action there was in each film. my only downside for part two is that it ends kind of abruptly in a weird place it would have been better to have the story go a bit longer in part two instead of saving the spider etc and so much more for part three.the longest movie ever made so long that the director had to divide it in three parts and thats why people call a trilogy. 10 hours of a phenomenal spectacle that will leave anyone with tears and a heavy heart after the magnificent end. in the fellowship of the ring we start with the journey of frodo elijah wood and sam sean astin towards to mordor lair of the dark lord sauron. and we see the great training and union of the fellowship of the ring an alliance of all the living beings of middle-earth on a mission to destroy the one ring and thus save the world from the darkness. in two towers we have the beginning of the great war between humans and orcs with the army of saruman christopher lee marching against the kingdom of rohan. and aragorn viggo mortensen along with the elf legolas orlando bloom and the dwarf gimli john rhys-davies joining in the battle. meanwhile frodo and sam are getting closer every day to the lair of sauron now having the help of the strange creature gollum / smeagol andy serkis who wants by all means his precious. and finally in the return of the king we have the spectacular ending to the trilogy / film. since the beginning of the film we felt the feeling that everything is coming to an end. frodo and sam finally reached mordor and try to find a way to infiltrate into the enemy territory and gollum / smeagol plans to take the ring from frodo who becomes increasingly heavy. and on the other side we have the beginning of the great battle that we expected since the first movie the showdown between humans and orcs in the battle that will determine the fate of the world with all the characters we have learned to love here together in this fight to the uncertain ending. peter jackson director-writer brought to life the masterpiece of books lord of the rings by the genius jrr tolkien. this can be the best adaptation of a book to film ever made if the book is already a masterpiece in the world of books jackson made a masterpiece of cinema. the gigantic story that was told in six books in film it was told in one film. a film of more than 10 hours it had to be divided into three parts forming the best trilogy already made. i say its just a movie because all three movies work as one from the beginning to the end we realize that. since the first film or first part we have the magic of tolkiens working here along with jackson fran walsh and philippa boyens writers have recreated and remained faithful to tolkiens work and the film managed to raise the themes of friendship courage and while it has always had religious references in the book and the film manages to convey everything in the greatest perfection. not only the writing is phenomenal but the visual effects are stunning giving a gigantic scale the movie so well detailed visual effects that make everything look so realistic. and the effects are not only stunning but also that the soundtrack that is simply magnificent. a trilogy that works as a single film that is a true masterpiece. a landmark in film history thanks to excellent writing and direction of jackson and fantastic performances from all the cast the lord of the rings is the epic fantasy stunning in every detail and be loved by all. 10/10the lives of two mob hit men a boxer a gangsters wife and a pair of diner bandits intertwine in four tales of violence and redemption pulp fiction is known for its high praise highly praised as one of the best movies of all time funny thing is: the movie is pointless and it has no message this is where it all falls in place the acting is top notch  everybody did an excellent job with their individual flair of black comedy the style was very familiar if you have seen quentins earlier work i found this movie to be completely awesome something missing from movies nowadays movies nowadays include a message but do not execute it the right way pulp fiction though has no message and executes it nicely its fun its gritty and its just over-the-top greatness this is what i wanna expect from movies but sadly nothing can have that feeling you get when you finish pulp fiction these facts combine to the fact that pulp fiction is one of my favorite films it has no point  but the fact that is has no point puts it up there with the greatest i had no expectations beforehand but afterword i had so much to praise the entertainment the humor and the point lying before yes it has a point but it is too obscured to find out the real meaning i love this movie and im sure you will too dont walk in with expectations  itll ruin the surprise the surprise is the joy and fun youll get with the film pulp fiction includes great acting great fun and overall great entertainment this is by far quentins best film 10/10  the last part of the lord of the rings trilogy was even better than the excellent two first movies. positive:fantastic actionemotional depththe feeling of closureloyal to the bookexcellent cgi negative-nothing this movie is in my considerate opinion one of the best movies i have ever seen and concludes a brilliantamazing-awesome trilogy.congratulations to persy jackson and all the cast.well deserved the oscars.best movie 2003.no doubt about that.i think that tolkien would be proud. gandalf and aragorn lead the world of men against saurons army to draw his gaze from frodo and sam as they approach mount doom with the one ring.the joker is the main attraction of this movie. this character was simply brilliant. everything went according to plan and this is one of the most faultless characters you will ever see. before ledger was confirmed to play the joker in july 2006 paul bettanylachy hulmeadrien brodysteve carelland robin williams expressed their interest in the role. however nolan preferred ledger for his chaotic interpretation of the character. ledger was also interested in doing a film having high expectation. he described his joker as a psychopathic mass murdering schizophrenic clown with zero empathy. throughout the film the joker states his desire to upset social order through crime and comes to define himself by his conflict with batman. to prepare for the role ledger lived alone in a hotel room for a month formulating the characters posture voice and personality and kept a diary in which he recorded the jokers thoughts and feelings. ledger eventually generated a voice unlike jack nicholsons character in tim burtons 1989 batman film. theres a bit of everything in him. theres nothing that consistent ledger said. ledger was allowed to shoot and mostly direct the videos the joker sends out as warnings. each take ledger made was different from the last. nolan was impressed enough with the first video shoot. ledgers acting was so lively that most people will agree that this is the best villain character ever. even when it comes to the best acting performance of all time joker should be in the top three. his character was so touching and enthusiastic that people will want to be the joker rather than becoming batman if they have a choice. this character had a deep impact in viewers mind. on january 22 2008 after he had completed filming the dark knight ledger died of an accidental prescription drug overdose leading to intense press attention and memorial tributes. it was tremendously emotional right when he passed having to go back in and look at him every day nolan recalled. but the truth is i feel very lucky to have something productive to do to have a performance that he was very very proud of and that he had entrusted to me to finish. all of ledgers scenes appear as he completed them in the filmingthe joker clowns makeup more sloppy than before his cackle betraying deep wounds he seeks revenge he claims for the horrible punishment his father exacted on him when he was a child. in one diabolical scheme near the end of the film he invites two ferry-loads of passengers to blow up the other before they are blown up themselves. throughout the film he devises ingenious situations that force batman commissioner gordon and district attorney harvey dent to make impossible ethical decisions. by the end the whole moral foundation of the batman legend is threatenedthe intelligent cut from the editor sally menke working with the master quentin tarantino has just made a movie worth watching over and over to enjoy each particular scene a tribute to everyone who likes movies and good music a puzzle just possible to be done by watching more than once in order to memorize those amazing quotes quotes like i do believe marsellus wallace my husband your boss told you to take me out and do whatever i wanted. now i want to dance i want to win. i want that trophy so dance good. a scene that makes us travel in time to gold ed sullivans time or to grease great lines that just tarantinos at his best could deliver tomato joke hamburgers 5 dollar shake watch hidden in the ass sword and memorable characters surely my top 10 best movies ever made.the hobbits approach the slopes of mount doom preparing to dispose of the cursed ring while the forces of good and evil are rallied in anticipation of the ultimate battle. the film won the academy award for best picture the only time in history a fantasy film has done so. the return of the king is the longest of the three films which suffers from having to cut between disparate story strands and - in its final half-hour - stacks up endings one after the other like jet planes waiting to land the director visibly reluctant to let these characters go. most audiences will forgive peter jackson for that for this is a fitting conclusion to a series of films made with tremendous artistry and affection for their subjectthe hobbit movies are better. but it is still all the middle earth movies are good. this movie as a great story line. it is one of the scariest movie made before 2012. it has great acting. great special effects. great visual effects. great movie see it. it has a lot of action. it is long but so fast past that you will not notes. you could watch the first 2 movies first and you still wont notes the time going by. this is a great movie. one of the beast fantasy movie ever made. it is so cool. see all the middle earth movies they are awesome. great movie great movie great movie great movie. see it see it see it see it see it see it see it. some of scariest movie monsters are in this film.the highlight of this film is one man and one man only...the late heath ledger...his oscar-worthy performance marks the best work in his short lifetime...and not only him but christopher nolan should also be commended in the way in which he developed the atmosphere of the filmthe greatness of this film is in its excellent presentation and articulation of what lies deep within a human being that makes him/her persevere against impossible odds especially so when he/she is facing a terrible injustice. this reminds me of viktor frankls book mans search for meaning based on his experiences in prison under far worse conditions than depicted in this film. it is only under the harshest and most extreme of circumstances that a sensitive and just human being whose integrity is under attack will almost certainly face the question of the meaning of his/her life and in general the meaning of life and the meaning of freedom. the only real freedom that human beings have lies in a creative response to the impossible but challenging circumstances that one faces and in that creative expression one finds meaning. no one can give that freedom and no one can take away that freedom _„_ its source is within and completely independent of external circumstances and institutions. all institutions tend to inhibit this freedom and instead confine individuals so that they become institutionalized. the prison is the toughest of all institutions. but the tougher the conditions the greater is the challenge and if understood that way the greater the rewards in finding meaning. but until that is accomplished one must have something essential and substantial to believe in _„_ call it hope or faith or self esteem _„_ in order to survive for nothing is accomplished in death. at the same time the idea of death itself is the motivating force _„_ a sense that one could die without having achieved anything in life is the most powerful life sustaining force itself _„_ this is the most stupendous paradox of human existence something that was hinted at in joseph hellers catch 22. at the centre of this catch is the hope a word much abused that one will find meaning even in the most hopeless of conditions that one will be able to forge something good out of the entire bs that surrounds us. and that which is good lasts forever. that is the true faith not the false faith of the corrupt warden who in this case is not only the proverbial devil who is fond of quoting from the scriptures but also gives the airs and appearances of one who is a man of god only because of his fanatical devotion to the bible. the irony of it all is brought out superbly near the end. the ending was the best part in a way because this story was no hopelessly fated greek tragedy as the central message of the film was that hope within one man can light up the hope in another who otherwise would have given up and that this evocation is a very powerful bond between humans in this case between two very different kind of humans both by background as well as race but who become the best of friends because they share something vital deep inside that makes them to get busy living rather than to get busy dying. finally what makes this one of the greatest movies is that it also has drama adventure and action which makes it appealing to a wide audience. for the serious it can revisited several times for the special kind of mood that it evokes _„_ a mood that is both uplifting as well as thought provoking.the greatest movie of all time everything was great. if you are a true batman fan you must watch. the whole trilogy are wonder full just wish christian bale would come out in the man of steel sequel.people had doubts about heath ledger but i believe he nailed it. i always recommend this movie too people who havent seen it.i think chris nolan and zack snyder make a great team and should diffidently keep going for more hits. possibly make a justice league in the future great storyline .... just sad to hear about heath ledger his performance we be remembered.if you like this film i also recommend the dark knight rises tom hardy also does a great performance. great job to allthe greatest movie ever made.. period. pure and simple it is what every director hope to achieve. the film will keep you glued to your seat if you know what it means.it will bring tears to your eyes. it will make you think how you have lived your life so far...or in fact how you have wasted it. it will teach you the value of freedom which we enjoy without giving a second thought. and it will leave you with a sense of happiness which you will experience only rarely. the performances are simply mind boggling be it tim robbins or morgan freeman or countless others. and it is difficult to believe this was the debut of frank darabont as a director.if you havent already seen it... please do otherwise you are missing something.the first time i saw this movie was at a friends house i was only 11 at the time and i never really understood the real content of the movie but as i grew older and matured i watched it over and over again and now that i know what it is all about i can appreciate it a little more the movie became my life i would watch it almost everyday and never get sick of it i would show it to my friends and anyone else who was interested in watching it i dont know why it took me like it did but there was just something about it a film filled with great one liners and sayings that would make you look at the world of crime a lot more differently very offensive in more ways than one but if you can manage to look past the endless use of four letter words than you will probably like it if you havent seen pulp fiction than see it because you will miss the number one movie of all timethe first time i saw this film i said those three words a lot to my friends and family. shawshank redemption is the best film i have ever seen in my lifetime. i have seen tons of films. morgan freeman gave a performance that will touch anyones heart. from beginning to end this film shows how films should be made.the first thing that came to my mind when i left the theater was oh man that movie was f#$@ awesome this movie is unbelievable. it is different from other superhero movies mostly because of its plot and the great dialogs but also the way the action scenes are presented. nolan has done a very good job and there is no way you will get bored or tired of the endless action. however the one and only feature that makes this film special is the enemy. the joker has become even more popular after the dark knight and became maybe the most likable villain. his goal isnt money or power he wants to see the gotham destroyed and corrupt its people as more as he can. but what makes him unique is that instead of killing batman which would make him reach his goal much easier he enjoys playing with him and torture him not physically but mentally. the awesomeness of this character completes with heath ledgers epic performance delivering the role of his lifetime. in my opinion this is by far the best superhero movie but also one of the best movies ive ever seen. if you like superhero movies you will love it if you are not a big fun of this kind but you enjoy a good action movie_„_ you will love itthe first reason for see this movie is angelina jolie but all in this movie is incredible dressing images music story visual effects a different story in this movie you found why maleficient go to the castle also you understand the roles of other characters the voice of angelina jolie is attractive but at the same time you feel fear about her most of us knew about this story when we were children but is fantastic watch this movie now in real action we could talk about this movie like feminist i watch this movie twice and i suggest all my family go to watch it sincerely i hope disney did this with all their classic moviethe first gangster film to make inane yet paralyzing dialog the star of the movie brilliant and engaging endlessly quotable and visually alluring pf made all the top lists regenerated john travolta solidified bruce willis centered samuel l washington as a leading man and cemented christopher walken among creepiest of cameos ever the side characters are more accessible and reminiscent as friends of ours then they are as plot worthy points of interest they discuss everyday trivial matters intensely while the viewer is wondering about the ramifications of the events just watched or know is around the corner and we actually see very little violence play out tarantinos use of the chopped up time line only added to the pulp mystique as well as its charm imbecile gangsters charming regressive american social interaction cinema worthy when combined  it remains a perfect storm for quintin & companythe final chapter of this great trilogy will just rip your heart out of your ribs i dont know how peter jackson did itand perhaps sucha masterpiece such as this has the right not to be questioned. i loved the first movie its steady pace of adventure is non-stop the characters are loveable the costume is nice the settings are stupendous and the visual effects is jaw-dropping. and i loved the second even better with the battle of helms deep finally winning over my breaking heart with the two lotr movies already gnawing at the bottom i had to say a final farewell to star wars 4 & 5 and welcome the llord of the rings. and with this my heart is fainally complete. the marmaluks are unstoppable and visually great no words could describe the intensity of their presence alone. and the battle of pelanor fields will get you to want to wish you were there yourself and not as an orc though trolls are cool though pales in comparisson with the mass of undead and of course the oliphaunts. gollum is once again as great as ever and the rest of the cast are comendable with great praises going to be due to gandalf and most especially sam the emotional intensity of the film is a full ten and after you cry from the movies story youll cry about why oh why wasnt it any longer and indeed we must now bid a final farewell to our dearest the lord of the rings trilogy the only trilogy to have a complete set of movies with no equals but each other. good bye........ sorry i just dont wanna leave it alone....the film is very well directed and scripted yet the film also shows that quentin tarantino is far better a director than an actor definitely an 10 out of 10 film but quentin tarantino should stick to the superb directing instead of the dreadful actingthe film begins by establishing at his own rhythm its ambitions men overexploited land resources which is why the only goal they have left is to survive this life is not enough for cooper brilliantly played by mcconaughey who gave body and soul to this character but all of this wouldnt hold without the total control of christopher nolan based on the languishing soundtrack by hans zimmer the luminous and impenetrable photography of hoyte van hoytema and the sincerity of nolans directing he manages to film the characters and to find the right cut at the right time always in harmony with hans zimmers soundtrack to give the film an aspiring and inspiring dimension that went missing for many many years thus we are transported into the same cockpit that cooper we feel the same remorse that he can already feel we feel the same gravity and we feel the same fear of the unknown melted with the force of his will all of this is brilliantly illustrated in a very simple directing choice which from my point of view is the decisive impetus of the film to directly jump from when cooper leaves in his truck leaving his family behind him to endurance taking off this simple editing decision allows nolan to give an original movement to his film and the musical crescendo makes us physically feel the sentimental break between two parts of the film you dont necessarily have to understand it immediately  the film will raise questions in you such as  what is it to be a human being is there some physical limitations to our humanity how far could we be willing to go to determine knowledge is there other dimensions that we can not access to and above all what is the nature of this intact and immutable bond that unites us to others wherever we are in the universe ? is this bond only intelligible or is it also tangible ? all these questions resonate in harmony in nolans interstellar interstellar is itself a crescendo increasing sensitivity and creativity i use the term deliberately because it goes crescendo with the soundtrack by hans zimmer which is one of the most beautiful music ever d for a scifi movie we are witnessing a perfect musical arrangement a total symbiosis a bit like the music of gravity which had understood very well how to match the image and the rhythm of a sequence to its own musicality zimmers crescendos are giving a new powerful breath to every new scene whether it is in visually powerful & intense moments or in more intimate moments it intrudes into our momentary feelings and sensations and manages to extend them sometimes almost to choking before resting on the balance of the film frame along with our mind spellbounded i have seen all the talent of the director that i knew he was outside the norm but whom i did not know his capacity to reinvent itself because this is it interstellar is not an action movie not really a blockbuster and it goes not entirely but mostly again the expectations of common people its much more than that this is much more than just a scifi movie it is unlike any of his previous films some hoped to see interstellar as christopher nolans best film and they were disappointed that this was not the case and indeed this is not the best film of christopher nolan because in a way it is his first film im not saying that interstellar is not as good as his other films it goes beyond all of them but to me interstellar is the first film of a new stage in nolans filmography  it is a masterpiece as it the beginning of a work ahead interstellar is the proof that nolan has finally managed despite all the expectations that were placed on him after the success of the dark knight to move away from his own reputation to create a personal work original humble sincere and deeply meticulously measured now in this third act of the film it all comes to life with unparalleled strength nolan poses and answers questions that raise others but he focuses his attention on the great mystery of love that emotional bond that can unite men and sometimes separate them but nolan is the only one that can successfully speak of love from a being to another in a film that mainly takes place in a another galaxy from my point of view only solaris by steven soderbergh 2002 unfortunately neglected by the audience was able to accomplish that interstellar is based on a premise which is the following  from terrestrial dust to the depths of space and time we can never be separated from who we are as individuals and as a species as we always leave a part of ourselves behind us in other words i could say that this is a human story and even if we go as far as we want to if we travel through the universe believing that we can be detached of the one we are fond of we will only get closer to them because the separation and thus the distance and time can only ultimately reinforce the relationship between the people who really love each other because it is going to the end of the world when we reach the end of ourselves that we reach the singularity of the black hole beyond the horizon *  it is our humanity no i

fellowship makes its final path through war and wilderness. the story comes to an 11 academy award winning climax. the movie has a stunning power unlike the other two. peter jackson uses incredible insight into sstories and themes and character study. the return of the king culminates its three story lines unimaginably. as the characters finish what is a three year journey you see exactly why peter jackson made the fellowship and the two towers because he wanted to arrive at this incredible finale to what is a career trilogy. i enjoyed this film for two main reasons action and intimacy. the action is stunningly realized by weta workshop. but even though the action is great at the center of it is what is a wonderfully intimate story. as frodo and sam make their way to mount doom we really get to see them both rise to the occasion. we see the real power of friendship as gollum continues to try to break it. when aragorn and gandalf arrive at over 600.000 orcs and yet they stand as strong as they were at helms deep. i become more amazed as the tale goes on we see how difficult and at what price will either side win. the feelings of community within us. this is a classic and whoever watches will not be disappointed. 10/10the fact that i can repeatedly sit through a film that is over 3.5 hours long and still be fully entertained is somewhat of a wonder to me. there are some movies that i cringe my way through or am so bored that i check the time and cant wait for it to be over but not the lotr. this movie perfectly captures the world that tolkien created by combining several flawless elements that work to make this one of the best movies ever made. the acting cast cgi wardrobe and general attention to the simplest of details are what makes this a truly magical movie. from the mountain of books in the background of bilbos study to the rust and grime on the armor of the orc berserkers its the painstaking attention to detail that makes this movie endlessly re-watchable and timelessly beautiful.the epic conclusion to this outstanding story. i have never watched a series of films that have been made with utter perfection that as you stare at the end credits you are left in awe of the pure brilliance of peter jacksons work - reflecting on what you have experienced throughout the trilogy. the combined flawlessness of the the acting the script the filming the special effects and most importantly for me the music have made this film a rarity of unmatched excellence that sets the bar for all other films. an outstanding achievement in film making that should be seen by all. a 10/10 for this film along with the previous two.  violent but in a cool way. shocking but in a cool way. i dont know how many times i have seen this film but i now see its so much more. its a rich intertextual film going experience. its a gangstar movie. for lack of a stronger term its a black comedy. its a renegade boxer story. its easy rider deliverance and shaft. its a film noir its a melodrama. its romance and action. its narrative flow is not just novel but near genious. if tarantino was only allowed to be credited with one film in his amazing career this would definitely be the one. the entire lord of the rings saga deserves to be immortalized as such an epic incarnation of great fantasy. this whole trilogy was the reason why i became interested in the fantasy genre as a young adult. i remember seeing the two towers and the return of the king when they were respectively being released in theaters. both of the movies blew me away. they were unlike anything i had ever seen in my life. this was a driving force to me because now i wanted to read not only the lord of the rings and other tolkien books but also the r. a. salvatore and dark sun world books. this was such an influential movie to me and i hope that it is movies like this that are passed on to the next generation. good acting epic battle scenes convincing dialogue well-done settings and an awesome story all comprise the entire lotr trilogy. i say this as a die-hard fan of the fantasy genre first baptized by lord of the ringsthe ending to lord of the rings is not only great and powerful but it will become a movie that is remembered for ages. the actors portrayed the characters perfectlytheir performances are memorable and the story is unforgetable. this movie and its actors deserve a nods at the oscars this year.the dark night is amazing. i have seen it three times already and i am going to see it again. i didnt like batman begins. i thought that the action was to fast and it cut away to much. this film still does that but it is easier to tell what is going on. the acting is great. christian bale is the best batman yet.every time i think of alfred i now see micheal caine. the real star of the show is heath ledger as the joker. he is creepy psychotic and funny in a very twisted way. 2 1/2 hours may seem long but it flies by. this is the best film i have seen so far this year.the dark knight was the best of the christopher nolan trilogy heath ledgers joker is the best his raw talent and natural feel for the character will never be repeated the talent over all in the series was out of this world..michael cainmorgan freeman christian bale & gary oldman to name a few the passion of this trilogy really comes out in the dark knight why so serious & do you want to know how i got these scars have become house hold quotes my love for batman became stronger cause of these 3 movies everyone should see them rent them buy them but watch them they are that great i recommend a marathon of all the moviesthe dark knight was probably the best action film ive ever seen. not only is the design tone special fx sound and music all were excellentthe dark knight was and still is nothing short of a masterpiece and a mind bending acting demonstration. the plot special effects acting choreography and the ability to entice a viewer into the movie itself puts it in its own category of genius. heath ledger is the movie. a perfect example of an actor who put on his best final performance never coming out of character and before you know itthe dark knight was a marvelous film. it shows us what a city might be like with potentially unstoppable criminals and corrupt police officers. my favorite content that the movie had was showing us what can really happen. corruption has taken over gpd and gothem is becoming a horrible city. some of the criminal tactics are just horrific. a world where the police have no power can scare the bejeezus out of anyone. the cast and soundtrack were also excellent. my favorites were morgan freemanlucky # slevin and aaron eckhartthe black dahlia. christain bale was also excellent in the film. the soundtracks were terrific. hans zimmerpearl harbor soundtrack made the movie come to life. everyone knows that a movie is not a true movie without an excellent soundtrack and the dark knight truly proves that point. imagine the movie titanic without the music. it would not be as good. same thing applies for any movie. the movie was an excellent action thriller. 10 out of 10 stars is not enoughthe dark knight trilogy consists of three of my many all time favourite movies. each movie is as good as each other. however when christopher nolan dropped the sequel surrounded with buzz and anticipationthe dark knight tops batman begins enormously. the line-up feels so different but only a small part of the cast is new. if you thought the first was good then this is the ultimate superhero film. the fact is it doesnt even have the feel of a superhero flick. yes you have the hero going around in a costume complete with a mask and cape and yes you have the villain disguised by something and wearing an iconic costume but if you actually look closer youll see the hero is a vigilante and youll see that his suit is very lethal and isnt a red and blue spandex outfit. and look closer at the villain and youll see he is absolutely crazy and insane but is also very very clever. the star of the film however isnt bats. its heath ledger as the joker. his death a few months after the release of the film was tragic so he left the world with one of the greatest characters of 21st century cinema. he is the glue of the film. the storyline is very good without being too serious. a bit of humour is injected but at the right dose. see this film and you will be amazed.the dark knight that came out in 2008 starring christian bale heath ledger aaron eckhart michael caine gary oldman morgan freeman and maggie gyllenhaal is a superhero movie of batman. when batman gordon and harvey dent tries bring down the mob they face a new threat the joker who raises hell in gotham. what unfolds is a 150 min of high pace crime thriller. the story is quite dark complex and engaging. the cast is just amazing. heath ledger gave legendary outstanding performance in his last role. his each dialogue is just amazing. i kinda love every sec he is in on the screen. the joker can be considered one of the best villains of all time. christian bale is amazing in his best role of batman. though not as screen time as he had in the last movie batman begins but still he gave an amazing performance. aaron eckhart as harvey dent was quite good. after joker harvey had 2nd best dialogues of the movie. pacing of the movie is awesome too. there wont be any part of the movie which feels slow or boring mainly because every conversation is important. action is kinda different and unique making it amazing . overall the dark knight is an outstanding movie. plot:10/10 dialogue:10/10 acting:10/10 action:10/10 pace:10/10 overall:10/10the dark knight surpassed all my expectations. visually the film is rich. it has that expensive big-budget look about it without it being too overwhelming. the action has been directed stylishly by nolan again it looks astounding whilst at the same time being easy on the eye you wont find michael bays trademark shakey-cam in this film. the action is great yes but the smaller dramatic sequences are where this film raises the bar of the superhero genre a bar previously set by its predecessor batman begins. the entire cast suit their roles and play them with conviction. as expected the standout performance comes from heath ledger as the joker - its an oscar-worthy performance in my view - but the entire main castthe dark knight rises is a masterpiece. its a movie i can watch over and over. it keeps you on the edge of your seat the whole time. heath ledgers role in this movie is excellent. he played the joker perfectly. the movie ends very well. its a lengthy movie but it doesnt seem very long because it keeps you interested. i believe this movie should be ranked higher in the top 250 honestly. at least number 2. this movie doesnt overload you on any one element. theres a perfect amount of action drama suspense and some comical aspects in there too. nolan did an excellent job on this movie and the whole trilogy actually. this isnt one of those movies where you can predict the ending or how things will play out this is the joker. the joker being in this one just throws you all over the place without making it confusing surprising would be a good word for it. there is so many plot twists. all in all. watch this movie if you havent already. its awesomethe dark knight not only pushes the boundaries to be a better super hero film it not only pushes the boundaries to be a better drama- it pushes the boundaries of masterpiece. it is a near-perfect depiction of how one man can really make a difference good or bad. this makes the film more compelling than the average action film. i will not go into detail about heath ledgers performance but in short it changed the industry. if you havent seen this film yet exit this page dont rent the movie buy it and just watch it until you realize that you are seeing a film of class and quality and know that every second that goes by is worth it.  not a single minute could be considered a bad acting well at least i think so. entertaining for it makes you enjoy the time spend on it and once finished there are no regrets. i am not a huge fan of tim robbins but the movie undoubtedly showed his talent. mr. freeman stays solid as usual in his act. the dark knight maintained the intensity and overall gunmetal grayish feel that sets this batman apart. the film takes us to a gotham city that has grown accustomed to the big bats crime-fighting crusades and the last remaining big time criminals have actually grown fearful of his wrath. they form an alliance to attempt to keep their illicit business activities alive but are feeling even more pressure from yet a different angle: the passionate and fearless new district attorney harvey dent. recognizing the crime groups looming extinction a stranger enters their circle and offers what he thinks is the only solution: kill batman. the bad guys dont know if they can trust this seemingly demented madman and they later learn the hard way that they dont really have a choice for the most disturbing part of the jokers personality is his motive. he doesnt care about money or power. he just enjoys causing trouble and watching with pleasure from the sidelines as the terrorized city scrambles in mayhem...which leads me to the real star of this film heath ledger. ledgers performance as the joker is astounding and consuming. we come face-to-face with a villain bearing the coldness of a psychopath and a personality that remains as mysterious and inexplicable as the real reason for the scars on his face. he develops the air of the lone offender quite early on as he nonchalantly kills those who help him commit his crimes. yet he has no problem building an army of followers and the viewers easily find that believable. as insane as he is hes focused and quite determined. ledger also brings the jokers humor to the role but he does it in a way that is unique to this interpretation...with subtlety and honesty. the very words and mannerisms that made me laugh also evoked feelings of sadness in its clarity. the evil is incredibly convincing. although batman is a character that is often marketed towards kids this film is definitely not appropriate for young children. in addition to the dark images the violence both seen and implied is sometimes unsettling and ledgers joker is chilling even for adult viewers. having said that this is by far one of the best films ive ever seen and it will easily find a place in my personal top ten. i am only disappointed that this joker the best villain in a film since hannibal lecter will never be revealed to us again.  along the way we also get to know and grow attached to the other prisoners trapped inside shawshank. the movie flows perfectly from one scene to the next never feeling forced or losing your interest. the movie is mostly dialogue driven but there are some violent scenes which help convey the brutality of prison life. finally the final 30 minutes are perhaps the most satisfying in any movie. i do not want to spoil the ending for those who have never seen it but suffice to say the final act of the movie leaves you floored. both times that i saw it i was rooted to my seat long after the credits rolled just thinking about the brilliance of the ending and the entire movie as a whole. forrest gump and pulp fiction are both great movies highly entertaining. i particularly love pulp fiction  however it is a travesty that the shawshank redemption did not win best picture. it was certainly the best film of the year in my opinion arguably the best film of the decade and perhaps one of the finest movies ever made. the even bigger tragedy though is that while morgan freeman earned an oscar nomination for his great performance tim robbins turn as andy dufresne went without a nomination. robbins carries the film and his performance is truly one of the greatest i have ever seen. the bottom line is that the shawshank redmption is a perfect movie. it takes you in from the opening scene and doesnt let you go until long after it comes to a tremendous close. along the way it will make you think fear wonder and feel a number of other emotions. if you have not seen this movie waste no time  go rent it today and see why this is the highest ranked film on imdb.  the dark knight is the second part of batman franchise with christian bale the movie is great with solid acting performing action directing. everything is perfect the ensemble of the cast is great. watched dark knight rises as well. the batman franchise with christian bale is the best. dark knight is one of my favourite movies of all times because of the action and of course i love christian bales acting. i sure do hope that there is another batman movie after dark knight rises because i can see this from every fan that its gonna break all the records. just like dark knight rises topped all the charts. i loved heath ledgers acting as well nice to see some aussies doing great in hollywood loved the part where he blows up the hospital and the way he walks i even met christian bale in person he is a great guy doesnt disappoint his fans. i really really hope that they make another batman movie with christian bale in it and anne hathaway they look cute together or they could make batman and robin hood.the dark knight is the quintessential comic book meets realism film. heath ledger and aaron eckhart knock it completely out of the park. every single character shows the most growth/development having to compromise their own personal opinion. it is a non-stop start to finish thrill ride with a detective story woven in. some men just want to see the world burn i just want to watch this movie again and again. gary oldman and maggie gyllenhall really shine in their roles. you wont even notice katie holmes departure. christian bale is still a fairly terrible batman but he makes for a damn good bruce wayne. the final minutes of this film were so powerful that they are still debated despite being put to rest with the opening of the third movie.the dark knight is the long awaited sequel to 2005s critically acclaimed batman begins and the second part of christopher nolans batman trilogy. it stars christian bale michael caine gary oldman and morgan freeman who reprise their role from batman begins. new to the cast are maggie gyllenhaal replacing katie holmes as rachel dawes aaron eckhart as gothams ambitious new da harvey dent and heath ledger as infamous batman villain the joker. the premise of this movie is that batman and lieutenant jim gordon one of the citys few in-corrupt cops are trying to take down the mob with the help of harvey dent gothams white knight. however while focusing on bringing the mob down a new threat emerges  hes under a life sentence for murder. tim robbins is andy a smart banker and accounting whiz who was sentenced to 2 life terms for killing his wife and her lover which he--like most other inmates say theyre not guilty of. and bob gunton is warden norton who when we first meet him is touting the virtues of bible reading and strict discipline. while fortunately ive had no first hand experience shawshank certainly gives the feel of authenticity of prison life and its society. a long movie most of it takes place inside a semi-corrupt state penitentiary in the late 1940s. red in talking his thoughts out loud to himself becomes our narrator for many developments. as the story unfolds increasingly we come to see andy as a person with strong personal values which he upholds in the most difficult situations. and in andys work for warden norton we also increasingly find the warden as morally his opposite: selfish and fundamentally lacking decent moral character--all show and appearance and with no integrity substance. in roger eberts first review of his two of this movie he said: ....the film is an allegory about holding onto a sense of personal worth despite everything....the word redemption is in the title for a reason.... most viewers will agree. the dark knight is the best super hero movie till done and one of the best movies ever created in hollywood.. christopher nolan created a masterpiece he is known to create some original screenplays in hollywood.. and he has done that in this batman movie too.. this movie is unforgettable by nolans treatment to a superhero movie and the brilliant performance by heath ledger... a charismatic performance that earned him an postmoustly oscar.. we will miss him and he will be always remembered as the joker.. a new way of approach than jack nicholsons joker and he nailed it.. christian bale and aron eckheart are also doing an amazing work but its all overshadowed by heath ledgers performance... instead of a usual fantasy film this batman movie goes to the dark side and took it seriously.. while watching this movie we could say that this super hero is truly a human.. a must watch movie for every batman fan and every good movie fanthe dark knight is second movie of christopher nolans batman trilogy and released in 2008 after three years from first movie batman begins. normally sequence movies cannot catch the same success with first one but the dark knight surpassed it and gone way beyond expectations. its first movie has 8.3 point on imdb and dark knight got 9.0 point and became 6th of top 250 imdb. all three movies are inspired by batman comics but it has some changes. in this version nolan had chosen to use the joker as an antagonist to batman. in whole movie we saw a sort of competition between batman and joker. joker tries to prove that everybody has a dark side even the nice ones and how insanity is close to people he says madness as you know is like gravity all it takes is a little push. when everything is getting worse joker manages to turn movies nicest and heroic man harvey dent into two-face which is also a fictional character in batman comics. addition to its well developed story its visual effects are amazing. although it lasts two and a half hours i did not want it to end even a second. actually the biggest reason i love this movie that i think it is a joker movie instead of batman. the first scene of the movie starts with the joker theme which is one of the soundtracks of the movie. i think it is a really good choice to makes audience tense and get ready to watch an action movie. then while jokers crew rob bank we get some information about joker. after the robbery he kills all of his men i believe that is a good way to introduce audience with his carelessness and mercilessness. he manages to escape from the bank by enter a school buses traffic and we meet his intelligence right there. after a few scenes later joker entered gangsters of gotham citys special meeting and when they about to kill him he puts a pencil on a table and says  i am going to make this pencil disappear when one of the body guard comes near to him he grab his head push to pencil then pencil disappears. i know loving this scene makes me a sort of masochist but if i had watched it in a horror movie i would not like it i like the way nolan build the conversation and the scene. later on at that scene joker offers to kill batman and if he kills they will give him their half of money. they say you are crazy and do not agree with him he leaves to them his card. i like this symbol very much because the card is the joker card of playing cards which we use in our daily life to play card game. on the other side batman just develops his equipments i think nolan make our expectations higher in this progress. i was really curious about what will happen when the two enemies meets. joker kills the people who inspired by batman and wears like him acts like him. joker hangs one of them and put a note on his fake batman costume  will the real batman please stand up . i really like the little tease in there there is a song by eminem the real slim shady he says the real slim shady please stand up and he is the real slim shady he calls for himself because there is a lot of people who tries to imitate him. joker does the same thing in movie he want real batman to take off his mask and show himself otherwise gotham will not be a peaceful city. i really like the way he treats him. he does not have a real purpose to do all his action or terror he just does these because he is insane. in other movies they generally give us a background about antagonist their life or why they are bad we know all things but in this movie joker does not have even a finger print history on governments database. we do not know even why he has scars on his face but in the movie he tells two different stories about it. the famous catch phrase why so serious comes in here. these stories have one thing in common actually it is about smiling. he leads chaos and he has always a smile on his face this is a good symbol to show his satisfaction from the situation he made. though he wears no heavy costume like batman wears he can handle with batman how does it possible he always uses batmans weakness. batman has ethics joker does not. in this movie batman obsesses with rachel and joker use this very intelligently and mercilessly. besides joker leaves clues about who is he going to kill next of course these are not ordinary citizens. he chooses a judge a commissioner and harvey dent. he sends even a message to the judge. when we see his message which is his card we understand that joker is going to do something. but the judge does not realize it. i like the irony in there. even police officers tell her to be careful and give her a letter which writes that where should she goes to be safe. as an answer to them the judge says that i am get used to these people and then she gets on her car. then she opens letter and it writes  up . the car explores and it scatters the joker card. this is one of my favorite scenes. he knows how he can leave his signature after accident happens. he also chooses people like him to make part of his crew. one of them is a schizoid and when harvey dent gets him he cannot tell anything logically about joker. they cannot reach joker due to the way he works.the dark knight is one of my favorite movies of all-time. i really didnt expect much before i saw the film but when i did i was complete blown away. this is the way superhero movies should be made instead of making forgettable popcorn flicks. all actors that includes christian bale heath ledger aaron eckhart michael cain gary oldman maggie gyllenhaal morgan freeman brought there a game in the superhero drama. this movie isnt overrated because it deserves all the credit its been getting including heath ledgers performance as the joker. the movie had a great script thanks to christopher nolan and his brother jonathan. the acting cinematography action and editing is outstanding and all the film crews did a phenomenal job. id like to thank the director christopher nolan for influencing me as an aspiring filmmaker and putting a lot of heart into the dark knight. 10 out of 10the dark knight is my favorite movie ever made partly because im a huge batman fan but also just because its simply put one of the best movies ever made. this is the sequel to the reasonably successful and marginally critically acclaimed batman begins which was a good start but hardly fantastic due to its at times slow pace and lack of all-star villains. the sequel on the other hand makes up for that tenfold with its masterful storytelling and amazing villains. in this story gotham is a better place than before batman with less mobsters and criminals on the streets but when a crazed criminal calling himself the joker heath ledger begins subjecting the citizens of gotham to his chaos and anarchy batman christian bale must step in. possibly the only way batman can stop this evil lunatic is with the help of lt james gordon gary oldman and gothams white knight district attorney harvey-dent aaron eckhart. the scene is complicated when the joker moves to corrupt the entire city including harvey dent and all hope could be lost. the movie is filled with classic catchphrases and scenes mainly thanks to the joker such as why so serious and lets put a smile on that face. the character the joker is one of if not the greatest villains in cinematic history because of his immense presence classic and thought provoking dialog and of course the oscar winning posthumous performance of the late great heath ledger. the character is the exact ying to batmans yang in every way and if there was ever going to be a villain to beat batman and go against his moral code it would the dark knights joker. speaking of heath ledger his acting is absolutely first class in this movie. ledger locked himself in hotel room for a month prior to shooting the dark knight so he could get the character right and boy did it work. he also designed the jokers creepy and menacing make- up and co-directed and directed a couple of scenes featuring the joker. this performance is one of the greatest by an actor for quite some time and will never be forgotten. other than heath ledger the acting in the movie is still really great with christian bale reprising his role as batman while still doing his gravely batman voice which i actually quite like. aaron eckhart plays a fantastic harvey dent and has good chemistry with maggie gyllenhaal who plays his love interest rachel. the directing by christopher nolan is magnificent giving the film a gritty and realistic feel while also keeping the audience caring about the characters. the way he used mostly practical effects for the movie also helped the movie along by making it stand out a bit from other blockbuster movies like the transformers movies which are just an orgy of cgi and loud noises. this movie on the other hand is subtle while also being a very strong and forceful movie by having strong themes and ways of conveying them. the story and the overall tone of the film is much more than just a comic movie its a dark and serious action/drama film. this is technically a comic book movie although it really doesnt have any supernatural themes or anything that really makes a movie a comic book movie like the avengers or spider-man. this movie could easily have happened in our world thats how believable the movie really is. to compare this movie to other comic book movies is unfair to comic book movie because this is no ordinary movie this is a fantastic masterpiece of film. although the highlight of the movie is the joker this is first and foremost a batman story and a damn good one. this film delves like no other into the mindset and psyche of batman and his moral code. batman will never kill anyone even his greatest enemy which can be a big advantage to his opponent but it gives him a mantra and code to live by. the joker pushes batman to the absolute limits like no other villain has before which is just another reason why its the greatest batman story of all time. the only problems with the movie are more nit-picking mistakes rather than actual problems with the movie. the mistakes are continuity errors with the color of the joker hair changing in the opening scene and his arm moving back and before around batmans arm between cuts in one scene. every movie makes mistakes and these are just two little annoying errors most people wont notice unless they see the movie as many times as i have. dark knight is a wonderfully awesome film with fantastic acting directing writing and is just about an all-round perfect in every way film. i do not say this about many films because most films have gaping plot holes or stupid characters but this film doesnt. i would recommend this movie to just about anyone except if youre a grandma maybe you wont like it so much. its the closest a movie has ever come to being perfect. i rate this movie a 10/10.  the most prominent one being gil bellows late as billy of ally mcbeal as tommy a fellow inmate of andys who suffers under the iron will of norton. if you havent seen this movie go and rent it now. you will not be disappointed. it is positively the best movie of the 90s and one of my top 3 of all time. this movie is a spectacle to move the mind soul and heart. 10/10 the dark knight is everything i wanted a batman film to be and it has that level of darkness that a lot of superhero films just dont have. the story has a lot of depth. the cast is great. the way nolan used chicago as his gotham made the film look larger than life. there is a sense of realism compared to pre-nolan batman films. i could go on and on especially since batman is my favorite superhero and that character played a huge role in my childhood whether it was the cartoons or the burton/schumacher films. people say that they had a problem with christian bales batman voice but to me personally it doesnt take away from the film because the essence of the character is still there. heath ledgers joker in my opinion has a become an iconic villain of cinema. unlike jack nicholsons portrayal of the joker heath ledgers joker will actually disturb you more than make you laugh. i always identified the joker with the animated series version voiced by mark hamill. that was the iconic joker but to have an actor being able to rise to that standard and reinvent a super villain was something i really did not expect before i even saw the dark knight. and that is really evident especially when batman and joker are both on screen. every interaction between them somehow brings back my memories of watching the animated series only this time its live action and its more mature and darker than i ever imagined my favorite superhero and supervillain to be. i could go on about the rest of the cast such as michael cane gary oldman and aaron eckhart for their fantastic portrayal of the characters. not only is this a fantastic superhero film but this is also a fantastic piece of cinema. if i could ever go back in time to witness this film for the first time over and over again i would just to feel the aura of excitement coming from me and everyone in the theater. i didnt know what to expect with the dark knight just as much as i did not know what to expect with batman begins. i was expecting a good ol superhero story but instead i was watching a reinvented batman and a re-imagining of the story i always knew of the character. the old batman films were fun for me as a child but the rebooted franchise definitely inspired me to read the graphic novels that played a part in influencing nolans vision. every scene is shockingly dark captivating but most importantly iconic and memorable and i sure hope that this film has a far reaching influence on other superhero films because the film really set the bar for the genre. every other superhero i will watch unfortunately will be compared to the dark knight and it will be judged based on that film. these are the only superhero films of its kind and the fact that it stands out from the rest shows how much quality the film has and how much it gets right. the dark knight is a classic in every sense of the word not just as a superhero film but as a work of storytelling in general.the dark knight is based upon the batman characters created by bob kane and is a follow up to 2005s batman begins. i remember in some earlier reviews of mine this year that i stated that i didnt even know if i would end up going to see the dark knight. after giving batman begins a perfect rating on this site you are probably wondering why i wouldnt want to see a sequel to a film i enjoyed so much. well when i saw batman begins in the theatres i thought it had a lot of style action and kept me compelled and entertained and i found it a really good time at the movies. hence the perfect review i gave it three years ago. then i saw it again on dvd and i did not like it at all. the thrills and excitement were gone and everything that held up so well the first time had vanished and rather than seeing all the good things i enjoyed about it on my first viewing instead on my second viewing i found parts of it boring and i started to have a few problems with the acting performances. i still kept the rating on this site to a 10 because that was my first initial reaction to the film but after not enjoying the film much at all seeing it a second time and having been entirely sick and tired of all the superhero films coming out this year i really couldnt have cared less if i saw the dark knight at all. then all of the really good reviews for the film came pouring in all over the internet and i kept hearing how dark and bleak this version was and i even heard of one critic who couldnt recommend the film because of how dark it was. this intrigued me because i have always been a fan of darker fare and the fact that family members saw the film and told me that i would really like it ended up in me seeing it. and to my surprise i thought it was as close to perfect as a superhero film could possibly get and i would most certainly call it a masterpiece. the acting was all top notch from every performer involved especially by the late heath ledger who played the role of the joker. i have seen heath ledger in other films such as brokeback mountain or im not there and to play this role he isnt more or less playing himself but instead going totally out of character and playing a twisted and menacing psychopath and everything the joker says does and the evil in his facial expressions show that he is a true terrorizing evil. all of this is perfected by heath ledger who gives the best performance of this year so far and i would compare his performance as the joker to last years best performance of daniel day lewis as daniel plainview in there will be blood. day lewis won an oscar this year so i see no reason why heath ledger couldnt get nominated or even win the award in his memory seeing as he tragically passed away earlier in the spring. his performance was one of the best parts of the film. what was also so good about the film besides the top notch acting direction and cinematography was its story. instead of being filled by non stop explosions high tech gadgets and over blown self indulgent special effects this film instead mostly focused on the characters and for each one involved we are driven deep into their minds to see the madness of the villains and the good and also troubled lives of the others including batman himself. the character study here is so fascinating that anyone taking a sociology or psychology course couldnt help but be interested. the story in the film had me drawn in from start to finish and i liked the menacing and dark tone to the film which i found all the more interesting and i liked how this film did not use formulas or clichÍ©s and instead gave us a straight out story that you would not know how it ended till the end credits rolled. the dark knight really hit me and made an impression on me. even days after leaving the theatre i am still thinking about the film and certain scenes and characters in it. this is what i call a powerful thought provoking and stay with you film that is so good that it has almost a power to remain in your mind like this. the dark knight is a brilliant achievement and i will go as far to say that it is the best superhero film i have ever seen simply because it is not like other superhero movies and this is also the best mainstream film of the year so far and i hope it is not shunned come oscar time.the dark knight is arguably the best movie ive ever seen on the big screen. it has everything that a viewer would want in a good film. the director has done a fantastic job. christian bale is the best batman/bruce wayne..i cant imagine anyone else filling for him. even the bad guys in this movie are awesome. the point that you dont know anything about the joker makes him a questionable character  get it . the joker cant kill batman because hes just too fun and batman has his own rules that he cant break  such as killing a man . the transformation of harvey dent was scary and the 50/50 chance of him murdering someone is even scarier because nobody knows who will survive. chance is unbiased said harvey. the ending is also quite atrocious for bales character. he has to disappear or else hell be hunted. why is he running dad - j.g juniorthe dark knight is an perfect attempt from nolan to show actual dark side of society. where hero must pay penalty for chaos created by villain. this is an critic and perfectly meant to disclose acting skills of each comic characters of batman franchise. all credits has been given to ledger who drove this movie from an ordinary comic movie to epic one. interviews of heath was perfectly showing how much heath was involved in character the joker observed lip sucking gestures in interviews. any where we never saw heath in movie instead it was an agent of chaos. this movie is never overrated. this movie is over qualified for ratingthe dark knight is an amazing movie the script is very well written the acting the visual effects its really hits you on an emotional level which is something most films dont do nowadays. i recommend it to everyone who loves batman even if you dont like batman youll still love this movie. it is probably christopher nolans most successful films next to inception. if you want to be emerged in a real life gotham then this is the movie to see though the old batman films portray a very comic book-like gotham this one shows that anything including the villains even batman is very possible to happen. if you enjoyed the origin youll most definitely like this one. it has your action adventure comedy thrown in and out throughout the movie and even your romance.the dark knight is an absolute classic and is not only one of the best superhero/comic book films ever made but also one of the best sequels ever made. filled with powerful directionbrilliant acting performances and excellent actionthe dark knight is christopher nolan at his best and most powerful. set after the events in batman beginsthe dark knight now tells the story about how now batman/bruce waynechristian balehas to not only deal with the mobbut also has to deal with a psychotic criminal named the jokerheath ledgerwho wants the destroy gotham city and make the innocent corrupt. the dark knight is a powerful and unforgettable classic that came out month after heath ledgers tragic death which cast a shadow over the film and with or without ledger presence the dark knight is still an excellent film. with the dark knight christopher nolan has created an unforgettable cinematic experiencegiving viewers a bigger and larger film than batman begins because when you look at batman begins as great as it is you feel like nolan was taking a test drive with a car and trying to know the batman worldbut with the dark knight nolan does not a take a test and knows this world from the ground up. with tdk nolan gives viewers a true epic scope raising the superhero genre to another level and makes a complex film filled with tragedy and sadness. tdk while definitely a superhero/comic book film has much more in common with a crime drama because of gangsters and the mob always in the film and the cops and lawyers that are always trying to stop them and the joker while also dealing with money and corruption. you feel like you are watching a superhero film if it were directed by martin scorsese or michael mann because like the crime dramas of those two films tdk deals with many characters and themes such as the crimecorruption and moral ambiguity. in other words tdk has more in common with epic crime dramas like the godfathergoodfellascasinothe departed and heat than say the fantastic four films. nolan creates a world in tdk where there is a since of doom and dread all around where the city of gotham is being held hostage and just filled with tension and falling apart and waiting to explode in a shred of darkness. batman and the joker in this is a true story of good and evil with batman trying to defend and protect the citizens of gotham city and trying to bring some good into the city and does not killbut the joker is different because the joker is true evil that just wants to see gotham city burn and corrupt the innocent people of the city including batman himself. the joker believes that people in general are not good and can be brought down to his level of darkness. the film is battle but a complex one because batman asks himself this question:what can i do at all costs to stop the joker can batman do it the right way or could batman kill the joker and be brought down to the jokers level tdk is a chess game and also a cat and mouse game where batman is not only trying to save gotham but trying to beat the joker. the screenplay by christopher nolan and jonathan nolan is superb with dialog and scenes that are something william shakespere would write because the film is filled with sadness and darkness all over. although the film is long at 2 hours and 32 minutes the movie moves by so fast you would think that you were watching a 90 minute film than a two and half hour film. the action scenes in the film are masterful and are much more intense than in bb. the action is filled with great suspense and jaw-dropping visuals and will have you glued to the screen. the ending of the film lasts about 20-30 minutes and like i said before this film will have you glued to the screen but also on the edge of your seat leaving you wanting more. it is a greatsad and tragic conclusion that will leave asking questions and prepares viewers for the dark knight rises. the whole cast does great jobs in their roles. christian bale is excellent once again as batman/bruce wayne bringing depthtoughness and sadness to the role. the late heath ledger earned a best supporting actor oscar for his brilliant and terrifying performance as the joker. ledgers performance is scarymenacing and masterful making ledgers joker one of the greatest villains in movie history. aaron eckhart is great as harvey dentan idealistic lawyer. michael caine is great once again as alfredbruces butler. maggie gyllenhaal does a good job as rachelbruce and harveys love interest. gary oldman is fantastic once again as officer jim gordon. morgan freeman is great once again as lucius foxbatmans weapon maker. eric robertsmaronianthony michael hallmike engelrichie coasterchechencillian murphyscarecrowand nathan gamblejames gordan jr.give good performances as well. the direction by christopher nolan is masterful and brilliantwith nolan using great camera angles and giving the film a haunting and beautiful visual style and also does great job in the action scenes. great direction from nolan. the  by hans zimmer and james newton howard is excellentdark and intense and matches the gritty and grim tone of the film. amazing  by zimmer and howard. in final wordif you love batmanchristopher nolancomic book filmssuperhero films or films in generali highly suggest you see the dark knightone of the best sequels ever made and a true classic that you can watch again and again. highly recommended. 10/10.the dark knight is a superhero movie with a darker twist making it more interesting and thrilling than the other batman movies in the past. christopher nolans trilogy set a new premise for the comic book tale. the characters her created were more realistic and less cartoonish. the theme of dark knight is good vs. evil. we have several characters such as aaron eckharts harvey dent and maggie gyllenhaals rachel who are fighting the evil doers of gotham. while they are fighting through the law to clean up gotham we have chriatian bales character bruce wayne/batman who is working as a vigilante to clean up gotham as well. one of the most captivating characters of the movie is heath ledgers joker. in all the movies before we have never seen the joker played as such a psychotic manic as ledger portrayed him. the casting of this character was perfectly done and the execution was flawless. even though he was the villain he was captivating and drew you in from the first scene of him standing on that street corner with his back toward you. he always kept you guessing and you never knew what he might do next. since the theme of the film was darker the scenes are darker as well. even during the day time scenes are overcast and dark. there never seems to be any light in the city of gotham. the creators of the film used this specifically to emphasis the darkness that plagues the city and what the heroes are constantly facing. as the movie progresses we see that even the evil starts to have its effects on the good guys. the joker captures harvey and rachel and is playing the batman against the police force as to who should be saved. batman wants to save rachel because he loves her the police want to save harvey because he is one of their own. batman however ends up with harvey and saves him while rachel gets blown. when the scenario goes wrong and harvey spills the oil barrel he is drenched in gas when the explosion occurs as they are escaping. with harvey losing rachel and getting burned he turns from good to evil and seeks his own revenge for what has happened to those he loved. harvey becomes two face. the transition of harvey from good to evil is one of gothams greatest secrets and we see that its carried on into the dark knight rises. overall this movie is very well done and sets a precedents for superhero movies. we can see that no matter how old you are you can always renew your love for good vs evil depending on how its done. introducing the darker aspect to the beloved comic was a great accomplishment for christopher nolan and his complex vision brilliantly displayed by the actors on the screen.the dark knight is a revelation in film making-both comic book and regular. usually i give comic book movies slack since the actors arent meant to be brilliant he plot is not meant to be mind-bending and meaningful and the theme is supposed to be something along the lines of heroes will always be there to save the day. however if i give christopher nolans masterpiece the dark knight slack i would be driving myself insane to put an infinity out of ten for the rating. the dark knight needs no slack put on it it is a great film. starting off with the acting ill end with the joker alfred michael caine bruce wayne/batman christian bale lucius fox morgan freeman and harvey dent aaron eckhart pull off the second best part of the film the acting is...beautiful. yes these actors are beyond good however the main attraction is heath ledgers version of the joker. you feel as if ledger is actually as insane as the joker and his acting is beyond brilliant and beautiful to the thousandth power rip. however that is only the acting the plot is great and the theme is something we should all remember. i wont spoil anything though you deserve to watch this movie for yourself. or better yet it deserves for you to watch it. overall: the dark knight is quite possibly the best movie i have ever seen the acting plot theme directing-i could go on-is just magnificent. if you havent seen it simply because its a batman movie you are truly missing out. nolans work of art is so brilliant and good that the dark knight isnt even a batman movie anymore. if you havent seen it you are truly missing out on something extraordinary.the dark knight is a rare example of a movie where *everything* is in place. christopher nolan doesnt cut corners. this movie easily surpasses even the highest expectations and i immensely enjoyed watching it. the plot was convincing and original. the script was smooth and clever. the dialogues were interesting and memorable. the camera work was top quality. there was absolutely no scene where i would think something like hey ive seen this before *and* the original was better or hmm this served no purpose. heath ledgers performance was outstanding. i mean others were great too christian bale gary oldman michael caine but... heath who portrayed the joker was just brilliant. unlike many other movie villains who are basically pitiful clowns his clown is a true villain. hes the guy you dont want to encounter even if youre a masked vigilante because the price is too great. the joker has no weaknesses and no inhibitions. like the devil himself hes smart charismatic dedicated scary and in his own sick and morbid way funny. worse yet he corrupts people he finds the seeds of evil in the darkest corners of their souls. the dark knight is a true masterpiece. even if you dont like batman movies in general chances are youll enjoy this one. 10/10the dark knight is a masterpiece in cinema with a very dark tone. with terms of direction an story telling i found this movie to be interesting because i already saw the batman begins. when i saw the dark knight it was nothing like the tim burton films we saw. it was dark and terrifying. the joker was the reason why i was on the edge of my seat. its the movie that holds the standards to filmmaking. the writing and the direction was great chemistry of essential filmmaking. christopher nolan is amazing architect of story telling and directing. the cast was great. christain bale played a great batman in this role. but the joker was the one stole the show. i would recommend that you buy this movie. its awesome.the dark knight is a film of many talents that puts director christopher nolan on a high list of directors who have made masterpieces but this tops any other film you are thinking about right now. the cast are tremendous and put performances in like youve never seen. this movie came out in 2008 and still to this day is held as one of the best movies created by man. may i say the imax scenes are spectacular to date. and one last thing the script it is perfection and will give you such memorising lines to quote to your friends if you ever go to a fancy dress party dressed as a character from this movie.if you havent seen this film then find some time and watch it because you will be amazed at how bloody good it is.the dark knight is a brilliant follow-up to batman begins and the definitive batman movie to date which makes you wonder if christopher nolan will be able to accomplish like this again. the dark knight takes place in a world where the line between good and evil is drawn in pencil. with the jokers lunatic smile and gleefully malicious manner setting the tone for a wild romp through a world gone mad. batmans universe is teetering on the edge and the conflicted superhero is trying to unravel the puzzle of how best to protect gotham city while believing hes not the savior his city deserves. 2005s batman begins introduced christian bale in the dual roles of bruce wayne and batman and the dark knight serves to cement the fact he is the perfect casting choice to shoulder the lead in the batman film franchise. gotham citys falling to pieces and batman is both the problem and the solution. the caped crusader has taken down a king-sized helping of bad guys although hes not working on his own. ordinary citizens have taken up his cause donning their own batman costumes and patrolling the streets. and now the mobsters left in town have joined forces in order to keep the real batman at bay. no disrespect meant to jack nicholson but this is the performance of the joker everyone will remember. nicholsons joker in tim burtons 1989 batman fit perfectly with the tone of that movie. in the dark knight its ledgers joker the rest of the cast needs to keep step with. this joker is nasty-scary a greasy grotesque creature lifted straight from the nightmares of coulrophobics. even those not given to fearing clowns are going to recoil in fright from ledgers mesmerizing performance. the dark knights action sequences are controlled chaos with cars and motorcycles and mack trucks careening down city streets and the films quieter moments are equally as engaging. theres just so much to say about the dark knight so much i want to analyze and discuss but expanding on a review of the plot would lay out potential spoilers and its best to go into the film without any knowledge of the story line other than the bare minimum. nolan and company have surpassed what they accomplished the first time out and the dark knight is everything youd want from a superhero movie and much much more.the dark knight in my regard had been the best directorial impression of christopher nolan in the past and probably will always be . the movie has a script beautifully knit with an amazing background  by hans himmler. unlike its prequel the dark knight does not engage the audiences with an antagonist who focuses on destruction and who loves his own selfishness to make others suffer. instead the joker who is believed to be a lunatic hinted in the batman begins has more rights to be called the protagonist. i write with an assurance that his role has the highest credibility to vouch for than anyone else in the movie. his persona as the joker suits incredibly fit to what nolan wants to capture the audience with and i am sure we all fall prey to it. there are turns and twists in the script rendering the audiences with ample surprises and bolstering action sequences and a decent merge with a breath taking climax. the movie as i have noticed after my 37 watches doesnt allow you to take your mind off at any instant and always engrosses you with your highest expectations. nonetheless your expectations will always be fulfilled to the fullest. a wonderful script and well nevertheless immaculately directed.the dark knight in my opinion was the most remarkable action movie i have ever seen. the storyline action scenes make-up and actors make the movie feel like its not a movie at all. its real life. the storyline is creative and memorable. the beginning has a great hook and makes you suspicious. at first i found this movie to be kind of scary and dark only because im deathly afraid of clowns. but as the movie progressed i began to fall in love with it. the action scenes in this movie are so fantastic theres no word to describe it. the joker constantly comes up with new games and adventures. my favorite scene was when the joker was driving the truck and batman flipped it over. i have never seen anything like thatthe dark knight in my opinion has to be the best of the dark knight trilogy. with its dark background and superb acting this has to go down as one of the best batman movies ever made. heath ledger delivers as the joker. christian bale is also good at playing the role as batman and bruce wayne. all of the other supporting actors and actresses did a splendid job of doing their part. this has to be one of christopher nolans best masterpieces out of all his movies. the many action sequences in the film deliver with great camera angles and amazing stunts. the way heath ledger portrayed the jokers evil side was tremendously good in many ways. bale is also tremendous too bad we wont be seeing him in the batman v. superman movie. if you are a batman i recommend watching this movie you will not be disappointed.the culmination of sfx cgi props makeup costumes soundtrack casting and marvel storyline with a very good dose of humor thrown in make this unique new film an absolute masterpiece over and above anything remotely similar thus far the unrivaled beauty of zoe saldana whom i was mesmerized by in columbiana simply shines in this role what an asset to any production a star studded cast provides a secure balance to the entertainment with acting youve come to expect from a handful of the very best in the business if you love sci fi adore the seemingly endless array of futuristic gadgets weapons and beings while firmly grasping a reality check with retro objects such as the ever prominent walkman then this film will not disappoint another highlight is definitely the soundtrack whereby a multitude of well known songs are used in some a little odd at first though they do grow on you and are totally fitting if i could id rate this 11 out of 10 enjoythe chief conceit of boyhoodfollowing the same characters over twelve filmed yearswould be little more than a gimmick in a lesser directors hands but under richard linklaters gentle guidance it becomes a singular achievement a film as freshly conceived as it is entertaining and thoughtful linklaters primary concern here is time and the ways we process our awareness of it his conclusionthat we are really of the momentseems borne out by the episodic way in which he depicts a child ellar coltrane who seems to grow into the role as he ages ultimately becoming remarkable simply by being identifiable experiencing events both mundane and lifechanging encounters with alcoholic stepfathers are the films most harrowing sequences and you can see coltranes impressions of them being burnished into him coltranes wonderful performance its hard to believe hes actually acting is enhanced by equally impressive work by patricia arquette and surprisingly the usually pretentious ethan hawke the directors daughter lorelei linklater is an absolute delight the film takes its time searching for its ending when it finds it its simple and openended fully appropriate and moving linklater has always been able to zigzag effectively throughout his career effortlessly navigating between hollywood entertainments dazed and confused school of rock and more personal esoteric work waking life before sunrise boyhood seems a watershed moment for him a rumination on what the universality of his themes has meant to himand in their ease and eloquence what they mean to us i cannot recommend this film highly enoughthe casting is top notch cinematography makes for a gritty realistic crime world. make-up and art direction could not be better. this movie feels really close to brandon lees the crow. i am surprised it did not receive an r- rating due to its dark content and wicked performance by one of the greats in heath ledgers joker. the pacing is excellent as well and the  establishes great character identification. suspenseful and wicked fun watch it with the lights out with a bucket of popcorn kick back and be blown out of your seat and here we...gothe campaign for the film was one of the biggest in cinematic history and it didnt disappointthe best there was the best there is and the best there will be .... and those arent for the movie nor for the hero these lines are dedicated to the villain heath ledger truly awesome he is .. simply cant believe how can someone act like that ... sir you truly are an inspiration .. a villain that cant be forgotten ... the dark knight is an must watch for everyone from the story to acting it just blew my mind simple exceptional .. watched it many times .. and still there is chance of many more .. cristopher nolen is best in batman series .. i dont think nothing netter will come for years .. every word contains a deep meaning and brings goose-bumps for sure .. batman is truly awsum .. no one can do it better then christian bale ... just want to say .. watch the movie .. dont wait for a second .. : s areal history or not  as someone told me its real but i cant believe that cleverness  beverage scene was good when he solved the problem of the officer  i need to see all movies of prisons as prison break but i dont know names as im egyptian cant now more american movies so i need help in that the best of movie of the rebirth of batman. the dark knight shows how being a vigilante is more dangerous than the comics have portrayed. a lunatic the joker has zero remorse for human life. batman and the jokers depth is made buy a horrific childhood like most of the secret law enforcement and killers that have been apart of our society. the two characters represent light and dark as they are yin/yang to each other. one cannot exist without the other. the movie shows how humanity is fragile in the midst of chaos. chaos can only be conquered or controlled with decisions that at the core represent the human spirit and our desire to fight for our right to live in peace and harmony.the best movie ive seen. the final battle for middle-earth begins. frodo and sam led by gollum continue their dangerous mission toward the fires of mount doom in order to destroy the one ringthe lord of the rings is an epic high fantasy novel written by english philologist and university of oxford professor j. r. r. tolkien. the story began as a sequel to tolkiens 1937 childrens fantasy novel the hobbit but eventually developed into a much larger work. it was written in stages between 1937 and 1949 much of it during world war ii.[1] it is the second best-selling novel ever written with over 150 million copies soldthe best movie ive ever seen. im just gonna start off by saying i love this movie. its one of my favorites of all time. thanks to this film for christopher nolan heath ledger christian bale gary oldman morgan freeman. i advise everyone to watch this film. if you have not yet seen i advise you to watch. i want to stay in your place because once i get pleasure from this film. christian bale was amazing as batman. aaron eckhart was all right as harvey dent/two-face. heath ledger also was amazing. i like heath ledger as joker more than jack nicholson. the batman series by christopher nolan was and is probably one of the best superhero series everthe best movie i have ever watched . heath ledger was the master piece. the entry of the of joker was brilliant there are some really exhilarating set-pieces especially the one that kick-starts the proceedings: nolan starts off with a high-tension high-anxiety bank raid carried out by a dodgy crew all in joker masks all whispering among themselves about the crazy guy in clown makeup who hired them to do the job. why isnt he there personally wait - is he there personally summary : batman christian bale has been able to keep a tight lid on crime in gotham city. but when a vile young criminal calling himself the joker heath ledger suddenly throws the town into chaos the caped crusader begins to tread a fine line between heroism and vigilantism . the plot thrown by the criminal joker to test the sanity of batman and the city of gotham .the best movie ever made period. i wont go on a very long and detailed review on the storywhich is magnificent and perfecti just want to say that this movie is a pure piece of art. the acting was perfect im really disappointed that the actors didnt have enough recognition for their performances actually the overall movie was underestimate by the oscars especially.this movie shows why cinema is an art powerful and heart full art. see this movie youll now what im talking about. i really tried to notice some gripes or problems but i cant. this movie is touching sad beautiful powerful and perfect. by the way f**k the academy awards for dumping this movie and do for forrest gump for the trophiesbut its just trophies... still a shame that they decided that. 11 out of ten totally deserves it.the best batman that there ever will be the joker was amazing rip heath and the acting was on point i love this movie it is a great movie sure some parts made you feel scared of the joker and all but none the less this movie is so good start to end if you have not seen it then go do so you will enjoy it. do not read any further if you have not seen it i am going to write spoilers exit now i like the part where the joker hits batmans vehicle with a rocket and then it turns into a bike and the computer says goodbye that was so epic and not just that but the part where the joker says how bout alive is so well acted this movie is great in all and shows how the joker can go against batman because he is smart and half the time he has chances to kill him but the joker tricks and stuffthe best a perfect slot of the triologie. what a pity that it is over now. lets wait for the hobbit thanks jacksonthe best  better than the three films ranked above it in the imdb. sorry godfather fans but i hated the godfather and do not think it belongs in the top 10 let alone the farce of being number one.anywaysi got my hands on the extended edition dvds of rotk and there is so much extra stuff.the main thing left out of the theatrical release that i wanted to see was the final fate of saruman.it is included in the extended edition but it doesnt follow the books version. in the book after the ring was destroyedsaruman had fled out of isengard and came to the shire with grima wormtongue there they tried to take over the shire with the help of some ruffians and orcs  they were defeated by hobbits led by merry and pippin in what was called the battle of bywater.frodo confronted the defeated saruman who was brought to bagend and banished him from the shire .however as saruman was leaving he berated grima one last time which sent grima over the edge with hatred he came up behind saruman and slit his throat and before frodo could stop them some other hobbits shot grima dead with arrows. in the extended edition of the movie gandalfaragorngimlilegolas and king theoden arrive at isengard where they are greeted by merry and pippin there is some small talk and then a conversation between gandalf and treebeard.saruman then appears from the top of his tower with grima behind him. he sends fire down at gandalf who repels it and breaks sarumans staff king theoden then tells grima that he can come back to rohan and all is forgiven to start a new life. saruman then berates grima as useless fodder and shoves him to the ground. grima then gets angry and stabs saruman in the backhe falls off the tower and gets impaled on a waterwheel that drags him under the water. legolas shoots grima with an arrow killing him. i liked the books ending better peter jackson evidently thought a major battle at the end of the movie would have been too much excess so he left out the battle of bywater much to the chagrin of fans and changed sarumans death scenechristoper lee was majorly poed when it was cut out of the theatrical release-i would have been too as he was also cut from the ending credits in the theatrical releasehe does however get credit in t he extended edition credits. that scene being cut out was one thing i didnt understandthe scene was no more than ten minutes long but peter jackson said that the scene was cut out due to time constraints and pacing i dont buy that b/s - saruman was a major player in the books and that scene should have been included in the theatrical release. i think some hollywood politics were going on and someone just didnt like mr lee being in the third movie- there were rumors that peter jackson did not get along with mr lee and so he decided to cut mr lee out of rotks theatrical releasebrad dourif also got the snub from the theatrical release. oh well the film is just pure wondertop notch acting and incredible special effectsthe battle scenes alone are worth watching the 4 plus hrs of extras. if you havent already go buy the extended edition its filled with goodies and extras including the wellington parade and world premiere event  with clips and video of the stars walking down the street signing autographs.enjoy lotr fansthe battle of minas tirith the march on the black gate the quest to destroy the one ring. those are the elements which make this epic fantasy film the best in the lord of the rings trilogy. it contains such an enthralling world of middle-earth that for the lengthly period of time the movie takes place you lose time in yourself to a world filled with mirth and magic. i think those fans of lotr tolkien and fantasy should grab this movie straight away. oh and try buying the extended dvd it contains more scenes appendices and an easter egg below the final scene in the scene selection of each disc. definitely a 10/10. by howlingrabbit334the all star casts performance is made by the fantastic script and dialogue in this movie scene after scene can be recounted which is always the sign of an excellent film samuel l jackson quoting the bible is haunting - not a good way to face death special vhs widescreen edition has a couple of deleted scenes which add extra insight into the finished version of the film absolutely fantasticthe acting in the dark knight was very well done as was the directing. heath ledgers joker was exactly how i think the joker should be played and his characteristics were perfect. christian bale was also playing the perfect part. i think that the dark knight was a lot better than batman begins i think the dark knight had more depth to it. every part of this film was brilliant the music the acting the atmosphere everything personally my favourite scene was the opening scene as it sets the film up perfectly. which is why im choosing that scene for my gcse film studies coursework. i think that this is one of the best films i have ever seen. the best film of the year and possibly the decade.the above line is from contact the novel by carl sagan and it is the first thing that came to mind as i thought about writing this review. i truly cannot explain the grandeur of the movie or how seamlessly pj has integrated it into the trilogy. this is no doubt the best film trilogy ever. trotk may even be the best movie ever. if not that it certainly deserves a place among the very top of the best movies of all time. while watching the 3 1/4 hour movie for the first time in my life i regretted having read and reread the book just because all the plot twists were known to me but even then i could not help but get gripped by the scene on mount doom and the battle of mins tirith. i think enough synopsis and explanations etc. have been written about the movie so i would not go into that. suffice to say that this is a movie for every age every genere. it has elements of action romance sci fi and some good old good verses evil epic battles. one thing for tolkien lovers -- tolkien was a master of the detail. in the book you can feel the colour of grass the cack on a marble floor and the smell of orcs. this movie is very much like that in detail. i cannot imagine how exaustive a task it must have been for the effects team to create such minute detail in every creek every cliff every suit of armour. all i can say is that tolkien would have been proud. i have heard that christopher tolkien jrrs son is not impressed by this trilogy. all i can say to him is that he should give it a second look and just see what pj has tried to accomplish. as for the oscar season i think the following should go to trotk best picture - trotk best director - pj best supporting actor - sean austin best special effects best  best screenplayten thumbs up if i had them. incredible story incredible cast. i would rate this as probably the best film i have ever seen and i have probably seen it a hundred times on cable. i would have to say this would be morgan freemans best performance out of all of his films. there should have been an oscar for him. this film definitely beat out million dollar baby for which he ultimately and finally received his first oscar. the academy wasnt all there when shawshank deserved its due. robbins played a great part in this film and did an excellent job however freeman carried the film. a true drama that shows the bond of two people in horrible circumstances. yes this one is one to own if you dont have it...buy it. you wont be disappointed.tarantinos pulp fiction was an amazing film the movie is full of colorful characters electric dialogue and so well casted every time you watch it it gets better and better each scene in this movie is so well thought out you will like it every time i would definitely recommend this movie to anybody its one of my favorite movies you can watch it over and over again and it will be great every time the movie is long but entertaining about 2 hours but its definitely worth watching however the film is filled with swearing and lots of violence so i wouldnt recommend the film to kids some of my favorite scenes in the movie is the ezekiel 25:17 scene the restaurant robbing scene the jackrabbit slims dancing scene and many more if you still have doubts about pulp fiction then you should watch it anyway you might like it  the french new wave or blaxploitation the wild bunch or the brady bunch its all grist tarantino really nails it with this all-time classic there is really nothing wrong with this movie the acting is amazing with samuel jackson giving his best performance ever the story is immaculate and the directing is unbeatable the editing and directing go hand-in-hand with the unique pacing and grueling dialog tarantino definitely is the master behind a camera there are twist and turns throughout this movie that make your head spin the long dialog scenes reads tarantino all over it and also the thick blood and crazy death scenes i give this movie a 10/10 because it really shows what great acting editing camera work and directing can do to create such a perfect movietarantino never fails to impress with this all time modern classic the film follows the lives of some very interesting characters opening with the bonny and clyde duo pumpkin and honey bunny. the film has nothing but everything to do with the duo as the film opens and closes with the two in toe some of the most rememberable one liners of the films contain the duo as they nock off an ordinary la diner. as the film progresses we are introduced to two new characters vincent vega john travolta and jules winnfield  samuel l jackson both hired guns en route to a hit. vincent seems ever the realist slow talking cool and confident jules the poetic religious man dog. the speeches between the two characters throughout the film are both realistic yet pointless pillow talk that gives the film a somewhat believable quality no matter how far fetched some of the stories may be tarantino has the nack of making them sound true by adding this banter between scenes almost acting as an air break or rest stop from the action and violence. later on we meet mia wallace uma thurman the wife of marsellus wallace ving rhames the kingpin of the tarantino underworld. uma is cool sexy and always something has to say. her mysterious entrance is made when vincent vega is asked by marsellu if he would take care of her for the night while he is out of town. this in its self is another story and another adventure in the film vincent takes her out for lunch at the well known but not so famous jack rabbit slims this scene again is one of the most iconic and talked about moments from the film. here we also also exposed to tarantinos rockabilly music taste which encompasses the film so well. bruce willis makes his way onto the screen in pulp fiction as a one hit ko boxerbutch coolidge. his story begins with the gold watch story this gold watch symbolises butchs drive through life as we learn that the watch has survived through many wars struggles and pains if a simple gold watch can make it this far so can butch. his drive through the film is to escape an accidental murder the result of a boxing match however many pitfalls await him and his girlfriend fabienne maria de medeiros just a light intro to the film and its colourful characters within but all in all a timeless classic and a must see for any film buff or anyone that watches films in this case i struggle to find anyone that doesnt have at least one good thing to say about this film as it contains all the qualities of a masterpiece to be talked about time and time again hard to believe this film is almost 20 years oldtarantino makes great use of non-linear narratives which creates an experience that you will not forget. with a cast of divine actors and a short appearance of quentin himself makes this movie an experience that will a stay in your mind for a lifetime. although if watching with others some scenes are highly disturbing and may put you off mood the movie is a masterpiece of well written non- linear story and there are plenty of laughs to make up for it. in conclusion if you are deciding whether or not to watch this movie in my opinion you definitely should should as it is an amazing movie and it leave plenty of thought for your imagination.tarantino is an enigma and most people seem to either love him or hate him: there is no middle ground is he a brilliant prodigious writer and director who meticulously takes the essence of the hard-boiled crime and detective stories that inspired him growing up and takes their heart and soul and re appropriates it into a story for the modern audience is he a shameless hack who simply steals from old movies and takes credit for them trying to claim that these old stories are his original ideas the thing is depending on who you ask you will get a different answer some say yes some say no but the thing is that everyone has an opinion because when you see a work of art such as this forgetting about any possible derivatives within the story it is impossible to look away always riveting bloody scary and most of all very funny with pulp fiction tarantino managed to take time-worn stories that had been done hundreds of times before and since and give it a distinctive tarantino flavor what kinds of hit men discuss cheeseburgers while going to and from their latest hit the ones in pulp fiction do and therein lies the brilliance of this movie as tarantino made everything that was old seem fresh again through his distinctive auteur style narrative that goes back and forth in time the juxtaposition between street smart cheeky dialog and the horrific actions of the characters and the weird morals within the narrative which presents bad guys as funny and sexy perhaps the myths surrounding pulp fiction do an injustice to the movie itself because so much has been written on the movie it has been critiqued so many thousands of times that watching the movie with the weight of all those expectations can seem a little underwhelming after all it probably wont change your life or inspire in you a life long love for hardboiled noir stories or anything like that pulp fiction exceeds in something so much more simple and yet something that so many other filmmakers forget to do: it succeeds in being a brilliant piece of entertainment that will keep you on the edge of your seat for the whole duration and when you get down to it i think being a piece of brilliant entertainment is much better than being a piece of film history but what makes pulp fiction so special is that it is bothtalk about your school of hard knocks. in the shawshank redemption columbia r andy dufresne tim robbins a tall soft-spoken new england banker is convicted-wrong- ly-of killing his adulterous wife and her lover. its 1947 and andy having received a double life sentence is shipped off to shawshank state prison in maine a maximum-security fortress packed to the grimy gills with thieves rapists and murderers. how bad is life at shawshank so bad that when andy trudges off the bus along with a dozen other new inmates the veteran prisoners make wagers on wholl be the first to cry. so bad that andy finds a huge wriggly yellow maggot buried in his lunch. so bad that over the next two years he is systematically beaten and raped by the sisters a crew of leering renegade inmates who take special delight in tormenting their fellow prisoners. make no mistake: andy gets worked over-and so does the audience. but then good things have a way of happening to unfortunate movie characters. early in his stay andy makes the acquaintance of red morgan freeman a sly survivor who is serving a life sentence for murder and who acts as shawshanks one-man black market smuggling the prisoners anything they want-cigarettes reefer cards with naked ladies im a regular sears and roebuck he deadpans. as soon as andy bonds with red things start to  look up. he gets hold of a rock hammer so that he can sculpt an elegant chess set. he does the guards tax returns in exchange for perks like beer on a sunbaked afternoon. he expands the dusty neglected book room into the most comprehensive prison library in new england. set over a period of 20 years the passing decades are marked by andys pinup posters of rita hayworth then marilyn then raquel the shawshank redemption begins as a nightmare a postwar- new england midnight express but it doesnt take long to reveal its true feel-good colors. the movie is about survival triumph and a thing called hope. its about a hero who rises above the squalor because hes blessed-a saint in the muck. its midnight express goes gump. you need a certain craftsmanship to traffic in twin brands of manipulation- the exploitative and the sentimental-and theres no denying that frank darabont who wrote and directed the shawshank redemption its based on a short novel by stephen king knows just what hes doing. the moss-dark saturated images have a redolent sensualitysynopsis bruce wayne/batman christian bale continues to eliminate crime in gotham city with the help of lt. jim gordon gary oldman and the new district attorney harvey dent aaron eckhart. the dark knight wants to finally get rid of organized crime for good and be free of their corruption. batman soon finds that a new psychopathic mastermind known as the joker heath ledger has taken over organized crime. the jokers plan is to terrify the citizens and throw the city into chaos and kill batman. batman takes the fight with the joker personal which makes him confront his own beliefs. the joker is the most dangerous criminal that batman has encountered and he will need all his strength and vigilance to defeat him. my comment this film just blew me away. christian bale is a natural as bruce wayne/batman and michael caine fits the part of alfred the trusted butler. heath ledgers performance as the sadistic joker was absolutely disturbing and scary yet simply amazing. i would not want to meet the joker in a dark alley and whatever you do dont ask him how he got his smile especially when he has a knife in his hand. ledgers performance has turned the joker into a new iconic movie villain image. between all the punches mayhem and explosions there is some good sinister dialog. the movie not only has a lot of action it also tells the story of the internal struggle that bruce wayne is having with being the batman hero. bruce wayne wants to be himself and maintain the difference between himself and batman. bruce must decide to follow the code or do what has to be done without affecting his own morals. the movie explores the literary themes of hero verses villain as well as order verses anarchy and the joker explains to batman that to have one you must have the other and because of that they will always be connected. the movie is long but it went by so fast. you will love the last 45 minutes because of the non-stop action with batman in his new sonic suit and his batpod. with all the explosions body count and the dark mood of the movie i dont think parents should take young children. warner bros. pictures run time 2:32 rated pg-1310/10sure its gory profane and over the top but i havent seen a film this fresh and bursting with new ideas in a very long time although resevior dogs was nearly as good i totally expected all the negative comments i saw  this film isnt for everyone but its a lot of fun to watch and this is because of tarrentionos cool ideas so if your really into film youll probably like this if youre female or liked titanic or both im thinkin you probably wont super movie da. best superhero movie ever.batman rocks da. batman is the only superhero who can kill all the villains and heros if batman

is the only superhero who can kill all the villains and heros if batman decides.he is equal to superman.such an amazing movie. its a movie that you can watch over and over. only thing that i hate is the way christian bale speaks when he is batman. apart from that i love all batman films starring christian bale. favourite character is the joker heath ledger. such ashame he isnt here anymore though the dark knight rises is also a great film and for all of yous who havent seen it should go watch it now havent heard if they are making another one or not but i really hope that they are such an amazing series and i want more like i said the only thing i dont like about the films is the way chrisitan bale speaks when he is batman. but yeah its amazingstupid people will enjoy this movie but will say its really not all that great. smart people will say this movie was beautifully done and almost perfect. yes the ending was long but necessary. just think of how many characters were built up throughout the three movies. they all deserve an ending. try to think of the movie as 3 hours long and think of the ending as like the clips they show during the credits or an extra feature or something like that. somethings i would have liked to see different or removed: { the ending was too perfect. there should have been more tragedy. however you have to remember that peter jackson had no control over this. the book was already written a long time ago. the scene with legolas jumping on that elephant thing should have been removed or somehow reshot to make it seem less crazy. i know elfs are strong and more agile but it was still a little crazy. maybe some plot changes but the book was written a long time ago so i cannot dis the movie for those. thats about it i think. } watch it more than once...read the books if you have the time...and try to understand. great overall. peace. remy.  i mean who else could have played jules except samuel l. in conclusion see pulp fiction it will be like no other movie youve ever seen if you are worried about the language it fits in with the movie so when you think about it its not really that bad. straight to the pointhonestly ive seen a great number of films and very few have reached out to me the characters the film making the drugs the banter between the characters everything in between has all become one and the same under quentin tarantinos directing ive always been intrigued by samuel l jacksons portrayal of jules winnfield a self proclaimed gangsterrighteous man shepherd and more specifically what makes me interested in this character is that he sees himself as a cleanser of the bad guys his quoting of ezekiel a biblical passage of epic proportions fits in well with this righteous character and only pulls me in further in this film this is my review of one character specifically but a review none the lessstory mission impossible follows an espionage team known as the imf impossible missions force led by jim phelps jon voight who were on a mission in prague to prevent a diplomat from the nonofficial covers list which is a list of all the secret agents in eastern europe when most of the colleagues in the team get killed the mission had failed and ethan hunt tom cruise was the lone survivor after the mission had failed after that hunt embarks on another mission to clear his name my thoughts although i had never ever watched the original tv show i didnt know what to expect from this movie when i first heard about it after watching mission impossible for the first time seven months ago i thought this was a really enjoyable spy thriller this is one of those movies where you must pay attention from beginning to end because there are some twists in there if you dont pay enough attention youll be really confused on whats going on i thought the plot twists in this movie were pretty shocking and the direction by brian de palma was great also there were only a few action sequences in this movie that were really gripping like the part on the train i was on the edge of my seat during that scene and when tom cruise is in the cia headquarters retrieving a computer disk in a secured room with the help of jean reno and ving rhames which i thought was reallywell shot i would call that scene as a rather quiet one but it was still gripping the acting tom cruise does a great job playing ethan hunt it kind of bugs me that people are saying that tom cruise cant act to save a life well try watching these movies and youll probably like him jon voight did great as the leader of the imf jean reno and ving rhames were great as the two agents who helped ethan on his mission in conclusion mission impossible is a great start to the mission impossible series which it had really good twists good acting especially from tom cruise great direction by brian de palma and it had some great action sequences 1010stephen kings powerful prison drama story is brought to life with frank darabonts the shawshank redemption. the movie tells the story of andy dufresne portrayed brilliantly by tim robbins who is sent to shawshank prison when framed as the murderer of his wife and her affair lover. during his time in prison andy makes an unlikely friendship with smoke dealer red portrayed by the astounding morgan freeman who does an excellent job of guiding the movie with his smoothing and confident narration. now the rest of the movie talks about andys struggle to try and break free from shawshank and the unexpected friendship between two different people. this movie is an astounding masterpiece that can only be spoken through the words of the mysteriously defying stephen king. director frank darabont helped bring kings vision to life on the screen and he performed an excellent job as a director and a writer. also the cast is such a true miracle that the movie was able to get the finest actors to play the most finest cinematic roles. tim robbins is excellent morgan freeman is astounding bob gunton is brilliant and james whitmore plays such a dramatic small role as brooks the shawshank librarian. also i enjoyed thomas newmans breathtaking  the perfect cinematography the excellent use of film editing and the spectacular script. i respected every single moment in this movie and it had me wanting for more. the shawshank redemption is one of the best movies ever made and i have never seen a movie with so much heart before even though of its slow 142 minute run-time. the shawshank redemption in my review a stunning masterpiece entertainment at its finest.stephen kings novella is a damn good yarn. the narrative is always engrossing the source elements of andys secret are carefully placed without exciting attention and you are delighted when events pan out as they do. then darabont adapts it and a damn good yarn becomes something special. part of this is the adaptation - a sensitive simplification part of it is the casting which is pitch perfect morgan freemans red was always an irish redhead when i read the story - now i cant read it without seeing morgan freeman. and most of it i think is the direction. the story unfolds in unhurried fashion with us being unsure of andys guilt for much of the movie but with a gradually building sense of injustice at the way those in power in the system can treat him and others unfairly. the secret doesnt come at the end but at about the three quarters mark and brings with it a huge emotional kick. and then the story is allowed to make its own way into a gentle and perfect end. this is without any doubt one of the most spiritually uplifting films i have ever seen.stephen king is my favourite author and i like most of his books and love some as well. one of the defining features of his books is the characterisation and the atmosphere. no one does it better. this leads to his books being long and slow some times but thats the part of it. this normally doesnt transfer well to cinema where everything is cut and compressed. this movie is better than the book. i read the book and i was impressed i saw the movie and i fell in love with it. the movie focuses on the two main characters and the side stories enhances their character brilliantly. all what comes before ties in to the end. one of the greatest effect in the movie along with the atmosphere is the soundtrack. it plucks at you it pulls at you and it lulls you in to a world where all that you see flows with it smiles with it and cries with it. i wont talk about the story since now after so many reviews we are at a stage where we can talk about other features of this movie. there are many great moments in the movie including the two stage ending both stages immensely enjoyable every time for different reasons. another great moment for me is the release of brooks hatlen from prison. his dialogue delivery _„_the world went ahead and got itself in to one big damn hurry_„_ and acting is brilliant at that moment and is perfectly captured further ahead in the movie when red facing similar circumstances confesses terrible thing to live in fear_„_ the same fear can be glimpsed when red glances fearfully over a stone wall in buxton to see if he is being pursued or spied upon while he reads a letter. great acting and direction this movie is about hope and friendship. those of us who have seen it many times enough to even forget the count are touched by it every time. we now see the movie in its entirety and every magical scene is impressed upon our memory because this is art. the message of eternal hope is wonderfully characterised in andy and that of friendship in red.star wars for todays generation and maybe even a little better than that because it is just packed with such fun that i havent experienced in cinema for a long time marvel has outdone themselves once again marvel and disney have been worried that this film will be a financial failure but i havent been in such a crowded theater since the start of the year this origin story of this band of misfits starts out with an emotional scene then the tone changes into this indiana jones in space adventure then it deliberately makes fun of itself and at last all these tones merge into one and the film keeps this tone for the whole length of the film when it needs to be emotional it is when it needs an action scene peppered with humor you get and action scene you havent seen before everzthing in this film works except maybe the main villain he isnt very menacing but you have so much fun in all the other aspects of the film so you are happy to overlook these details plus ronan the accuser serves just as buildup for a much greater threat every character steals every scene they are in there is no way you will be able to pick your favorite character because in every scene suddenly all of them become your favorite chris pratt has turned over a night into a household name all thanks to marvel and his charm and likability before he served as a professional goof ball but i dont think that will be the case anymore he shows such a wide range switching from comedy into actionadventure or a quickwitted scoundrel zoe saldana has established herself a long time as the gotoaction actress and once she shows why she has earned that she can be sexy funny and kick ass all in one moment dave bautista is a real surprise here as the warrior taking thins way too literal and therefore his actions and dialogue end up as some of the funniest in the entire film bradley cooper has tried to make his voice unrecognisable as the rocket racoon and he has created not another cg animated character but a character from flesh blood and fur his cynical guntoting maniacal raccoon will surely end up as the fans favorite but as i have stated before all the characters get the same time to shine groot a sentient tree with a limited vocabulary is the most innocent of all of the members of the team james gunn had to abandon his dark humor and frankly a little weird for the mainstream audience but what is more than obvious is the enthusiasm that this film was made with in every shot you can see the filmmaker who finally got the budget to realize all his dreams and ideas and so he stuffs into this film all those shots and camera angles of his dreams are all here the film is therefore such an amazing ride which sucks you in for 2 hours and then spits you out and you will want to go and see it immediately its that kind of a movie this is the film that all the teenagers are going to be talking about when they are 30 years old in the same way the star wars generation talks about that experience today the whole marvel cinematic universe is a history in the making which i am sure will be talking about for a long time the choice is yours if you want to go and see heavy intense drama disguised as a summer blockbuster go see the dawn of the planet of the apes  but if you want a selfreferential lighthearted fun go see the guardians of the galaxy it is one of the best films you will be able to see this yearsorry entire cast other than heath ledger. heath blew this character out of this role. they could have called this movie the joker. his role made me become a huge batman fan. i already collect movies but i went in to high gear for the different covers of the movie especially when he was on cover. i have a framed picture of him where he is standing in the street when he thinks he finally caught batman. the poster has his and christian bales facsimile autographs. im still searching for more different covers. jack nicholson is one of the greatest actors but sorry mr. jack nicholson heath made you look like a novice actor i highly recommend this movie. has a great story great acting great directing but out this world acting from heath ledger. he is a actor that will be missedsome scenes that totally worth it to watch this movie over and over. the scene of the blood with the h when mia is od when travolta and mia are talking about a relationship and then started to dance it is just amazing how quentin tarantino could reach that level of movie one of the biggest movies of all times with i think reservoir dogs. i could recommend this film to almost everybody and i think everyone could fall in love with this movie. in the other hand the soundtrack is amazing i love it all especially those sad songs like lonesome town if love was a red dress. and the way the actors get into the character is very coolsome people are a bit hesitant to watch this movie due to the length of it and the tendency for the first movie to drag on a bit but even if you found the first 2 movies to be a bit boring for your taste you should by no means hesitate to watch this movie. the return of the king is the most beautifully made movie every piece of the movie from the story to the action to the visual effects to the acting is just absolutely stunning. i have personally been looking for movies that can provide the same experience that this movie provides and there is clearly no match. the movie concludes the lord of the rings series showing everyones final push to end the reign of sauron. the movie starts off with the story of how gollum came to be which if you ask me has been long overdue but a great addition. the movie then continues to show the struggle frodo is having bearing the influence of the ring and sam continues to show his support for frodo despite gollums attempts to undermine sam and trick frodo. the rest of the cast find out that sauron has plans to destroy gondor and each contribute a role to stop saurons army. the movie continues to drag you to the edge of your seat when i first saw it i wished that the movie wouldnt end but when it did it left a satisfying bittersweet feeling for those who followed frodo from the shire in the beginning. if you havent watched it put it on your list you wont regret it.so this movie contains the best acting roles in the respective careers of john travolta samluel jackson uma thurman and bruce willis on top of that and maybe in support of that it has the best dialog ever seen in a movie what more do people want this is a masterpiece in a totally different category than anything tarrantino released before or after and people who dont like excessive violence more than 10000 people are shot to death each year in the states so really open your eyes it is not like this comes from nothing this movie is completely realistic in that aspectso there are basically 3 cinderella films now that will be forever referenced the original animated cinderella ever after and this live action cinderella i wasnt a fan of the original animated film when i saw it as a grade school kid but i really enjoyed ever after when i saw it as a college student now as a grumpy middle aged man i was reluctant to see another retelling of this classic story but my wife really wanted to see it so i gave it a shot glad that i did because i believe this cinderella is the best of them all this film does an excellent job of blending the realism of ever after with the fantasymagic from the animated film it also truly excels in showing you the depth of the relationships between cinderella and her parents and the prince with his father  even thought the onscreen time between the parents and kids is limited lily james as cinderella does an excellent job of showing frustration while maintaining her promise to mom  to be kind to others in other words she showed her humanity and wasnt just some sort of animated caricature its a shame movies like this dont often win best picture or best actoractress because the acting is that good in this film  all the way around go see it but bring some tissues with youso the movie was shot in 12 years thats hell of a record and its the first thing that makes this movie special the actors and actresses are actually growing up on scene the movie is a slow and soft piece of music with really no climax and all but every moment of it can be enjoyed profoundly there are lots of rooms for deep life lessons that you can absorb from the life of a young artistic kinda weird boy and everyone around him it feels like human kind is still on the way of figuring out the meaning of life this movie wont answer the question you can never answer the question but somewhere in this movie hidden around the corners you see the slightest clues of what life means what you want to do with it how to know who you want to be i wouldnt be surprised if this movie gets the oscar in 2 weeks despite many bad ratings going on around it its a movie that takes patience and experience to truly understand and feel forso good movie the dark knight in my opinion was the most remarkable action movie i have ever seen. the storyline action scenes make-up and actors make the movie feel like its not a movie at all. its real life. the storyline is creative and memorable. the beginning has a great hook and makes you suspicious. at first i found this movie to be kind of scary and dark only because im deathly afraid of clowns. but as the movie progressed i began to fall in love with it. the action scenes in this movie are so fantastic theres no word to describe it. the joker constantly comes up with new games and adventures. my favorite scene was when the joker was driving the truck and batman flipped it over. i have never seen anything like thatsince the 90s came to a close ive been considering what the best films of the last decade were. the more i think about it the more i become convinced that pulp fiction will be seen as a milestone in american filmmaking. for one it is simply an incredible film in its own right. wonderfully drawn characters an incredibly compelling non-linear storyline and dialogue that shaped popular culture. from a historical perspective however it also represents a lot. it represents the emergence of independent films. before pulp fiction independent films were a rarity for the academy awards and now at least one best picture slot is guaranteed for them. it also virtually created the careers of john travolta now one of the top box office draws sam jackson and quentin tarantino. but most importantly it raised the bar in so many ways. the way it told the story that gags it used to get laughs and thrills at the same time and every other element of the film are now the standard that every other movie should be held to. an incredible film and an incredibly important one as well.  the characters the dialogue the music the colors the crazy plot. i wish tarantinos follow-up to pulp fiction had also been an ensemble piece but my guess is that he wanted to avoid being pegged as a certain kind of storyteller. in my book hes only one kind of storyteller: a great one. outside of short cuts this is the best film ive ever seen. 10 stars. simply put you will never see a more perfect piece of non-linear narrative as one that invented this sub-genre tarantino perfects this style with a mix of sublime acting perfect dissections of story plots i am positive i will never see a film as good as this the film offers a combination of perfect set pieces with memorable quotes most notably say what again and memorable characters such as the jules winnfield and vincent vega duo the complex story of the suitcase is depicted in a way that can be followed and understood and the hitchcock-inspired cameo by tarantino is pitch perfect and adds a perfect depth to the character development of each plot in the filmsimilar to at least one of my fellow reviewers this is my first review if it happens to be my last as well i wouldnt mind this movie warrants a review the night before seeing interstellar i had watched stanley kubricks 2001 a space odyssey which may have been the best movie of its decadecentury as well i was blown away by the beauty and grandeur of kubricks masterpiece and i was worried that seeing it so soon before interstellar would lead me to great disappointment in nolans film fortunately this is not the case interstellar lived up to kubricks odyssey and will be one of my favorite movies of all time nolans movie certainly didnt surpass odyssey the two occupy a very different space no pun intended in my mind and in the annals of cinema i can say with confidence that the two of these movies have illustrated the glory of what can be achieved in a scifi film and they cause all others to pale in comparison even the recently released and acclaimed gravity has no such weight compared to these two masterpieces another great pun without spoiling any of the film i would like to discuss some details that impressed me the  is phenomenal the acting is powerful and the special effects are superb but perhaps my favorite aspect of the movie are the apparent nods to kubricks odyssey which made the dualexperience even more significant certain elements of the film reminded me of kubricks jupiter and beyond the infinite sequence the mysterious monoliths even the legendary hal9000 even with these slight similarities so much of the movie was different and in enough ways bolder such that interstellar feels incredibly fresh and original christopher nolan cowrote and directed this film which only further solidifies his status as one of the greatest directors of our generation even with his hardtomatch lineup of prior successes this movie is a phenomenal standout the runtime felt very appropriate and just like odyssey i was pleased with how many things were addressed after what seemed like logical stopping points please treat yourself to a theater experience of interstellar if you love scifi if you love the realities of space and astronomy even if you only love great film making you will love this moviesheer brilliance from start to finish. the perfect end to the perfect trilogy. absolutely mindblowing. go see it.shawshank redemption is without doubt one of the best films ever made and definitely the best film of 1994. yes it is better than lion king and i really like that too. it is not only enthralling but powerful and moving too. i will confess that i didnt understand it when i first saw it as a lot happens in the film and i have now seen it three times. i seriously hope that those who ignored the film when it was first released now recognise it as a great film as it really is. the dialogue was extremely well-written with lines that really stick in your mind. the cinematography and music are both gorgeous and the prison itself is like a character that dominates the film. in the script there are some true elements of stephen king now i admit i am not a huge king fan and usually dont like coarse language in books. but in his books like it which is very good i have accepted the language represents brutality and rebellion shown perfectly in the film with the battle of acceptance i suppose between the inmates and the superiorslike the scene with the warden yelling coarse language at the new inmates lined up in a row at the beginning.the acting was exceptional. i am not hugely familiar with tim robbins but he did a great job in a very demanding role. the best performance however comes from morgan freeman as red who was seriously robbed of that oscar that he lost to tom hanks for forrest gump. freeman reminds me very strongly or his style of acting does remind me of that of sean connery suave yet very charismatic. acting isnt just about your vocal range its about depth which was what freeman certainly had. in short freeman was brilliant in what could be his best performance. the scene where the inmates are listening to the mozart aria over the speakers was a beautiful profound moment and i actually cried in brooks death scene. very rarely do king adaptations translate-to screen well because of the large scale of the authors books with the exception of this and the shining. some like it and dreamcatcher are genuinely memorable but have a number of flaws that prevent them from being classed as outstanding. and some like thinner and tommyknockers that border on unwatchable. in conclusion shawshank is a brilliant film that is worthy of the credit it has been denied for so-long. 10/10 of course. bethany cox.shawshank redemption is without a doubt the most uplifting and touching film i have ever seen. it is the only movie ive seen that has made tears of happiness come to my eyes. i would and do recommend this film to anyone and everyone.shawshank redemption is probably one of the greatest movies out there hands down. its a story about a banker named andy dufresne who is sentenced to life in prison for killing his wife and her secret lover.at first for andy it seems that life has taken a toll for the worst while he goes through the first initial weeks in shawshank.fortunately he befriends a group of the inmates over the course of his time there. mainly a character named red who has some push on things that go down in the prison. red and andy learn a lot of lessons from each other and become really great friends over their course of time at shawshank. the dialogue in this movie is not only enticing but also has a bit of comic relief here and there. to me this movie mainly revolves not only the character development of andy as a man sent to jail for life but mainly about the human condition and what it is like to no longer be a free man. andys most important lesson that he learns in shawshank is that while they can take virtually everything away from you including your pride and your dignity they can never take your hope.shawshank redemption is a very moving story about hope and the power of friendship. the cast is first rate with everyone giving a great performance. tim robbins and morgan freeman carry the movie but bob gunton and clancy brown are perfect as the warden norton and prison guard captain hadley respectively. and james whitmores portrayal of an elderly inmate brooks is moving. the screenplay gives almost every actor at least one or more memorable lines through out the film. as well as a very surprising twist near the end that almost knocked me out of my chair. if you have not seen this movie rent it or better yet buy it. as i bet youll want to see this one more than once.shawshank redemption gives the feel of a strong firm and amazing story that can move people while sitting down to watch it. the characters are memorable. morgan freeman as red will always be in my head. tim robbins and any dufrense is amazing as well. shawshank gives the audience a taste of a perfect movie. movies like this dont come often. movies come with strong stories but acting and flow of this story can mess it up. shawshank doesnt disappoint. the acting is superb and the flow of the story is unforgettable. based on the stephen king novel rita hayworth and the shawshank redemption id say this is one of the movies where the film triumphs over the novel. the film also brings a sense of humor which is a very good tool for films like these because if everything is serious its very possible that it might be killed. well people have their own opinion. one scene amazes me and probably is one of my favorite scenes in the film is when the prisoners are watching gilda and theyre all waiting for rita hayworth to do the thing with her hair. it still makes me laugh and pleased with the acting and reactions of the prisoner and the beauty of rita hayworth herself. shawshank redemption is a one-of-a-kind film where stories come in and the film enlarges the story and puts it into a whole new level. the excellent acting and a great adapted screenplay makes this movie one of the greatest films ever in history.  you get hooked in their mindless conversations and invest in their characters. the soundtrack will make you bob your head throughout the whole film and bobbing it hours after youve seen it. its safe to say it is brilliant and really suits the film perfectly and when listened to sounds like it was perfectly made for a specific scene in the film. this film quentin tarintino on the map as one of the directors to see because of the jazzy cool vibe his films have. the directing is good with great uses of one shots and experimenting with transitions and angles such as the angle in which john travolta and samuel l. jackson get their guns from the car boot. but the main star of the film is the writing. the writing is genius and flawlessly executed by the actors. you will be quoting this film a couple of years after you see it. if you pick any line from this film it will probably be a good one. basically this film is a masterpiece and defined a genre that many writers will try to do. shawshank redemption first time when i heard this name i had no idea what shawshank is all about. i must accept the fact that i was not fascinated by its name but luckily i managed to see this movie. this movie is awesome it will fill you with hope when you start loosing hope at some point of time in your life. thats the power of this movie. i have seen this movie maximum number of times as i have not seen others. story goes this way: a man who was wrongly convicted murder of his wife and her lover. he got two life sentences back to back. he felt that he might not be proved good husband but he was not a murderer so he started planning to dig the tunnel to be free from this. the way he dig the tunnel and the person who helped him in his project was the crux of this movie. so it was his hope that was kept deep inside his heart that provide such a power to escape from the shawshank. please rent the dvd and watch it. you will surely find it most amazing movie as you have ever witness.shawshank redemption based on a short story by stephen king is about a man named andy who is sent to jail after being convicted of killing his wife and lover he adapts to jail and is planning something big - all through the film clues are given as to what he is doing as he takes advantage of certain privileges he has. he makes friends with people in jail and goes through his daily life. hope is all he can hold on to count on and rely on. through years he figures a way to end all of it. the story fallows himself and friends as they try to rid themselves of an underlying feeling - a feeling of always being trapped. they hated the walls of the jail. theyve grown used to them. and they love them. but not andy. everything about this movie is amazing. screenplay cinematographyacting production... its simply one of the best films off all time.shawshank redemption at first wont strike you as a great moviewhen u look at the castexcept morgan and other things but believe me its the best the story and the cast simply overwhelms you its such a great film that one would want to watch it again and again. the movie gives a feel that not many movies can give. it gives you sense of contempt that you had taken the right choice in seeing this film. well it was released when i was very young i could find time to see it only now. and i still feel i should have seen this movie long before its worth every second guys dont miss it its the best  but the most important fact is that lotr is not only an adventure: it is a great lifes metaphor and the end of this trilogy complete the sense of life that tolkien want to tell us: never stop searching for new experience never think of having arrived there is always something you can discover and it can be both good and evil. the last image of the film when gandalf the elves and frodo are leaving the middle-earth is the perfect conclusion of the greatest and the most epic saga of all time. seriously this was one of the greatest films i have ever seen. plain and simple. im not saying it did not have some silly stupid stuff in it that i could have done without but overall what a movie ledgers joker will never be topped. every scene in the movie that did not have joker in it i was sitting there going whens the joker coming back. i just simply could not get enough of the character. he was so deep and so true to form. i could not have asked for anything more from ledgers performance. i would have rathered the movie have been rated r and seen a little more gore because i think thats the only thing the joker was not able to display was his cruelty. but still a fantastic performance. oscar worthy i dont know but its got to be the closest any comic book performance has gotten to being oscar worthy. most of my guesses at the plot line were right on. bale can over act a bit at times. but none of it matters. ledger steals the movie and everything else takes a back seat to his performance.seriously if ever theres a film that people should be forced to watch its this. the acting in it is truly perfect the storyline in very very well written and the ending is one of the cleverest and most misleading endings i have ever witnessed. this film can and will be enjoyed by people of all ages relatively - check parents guide for suitability and will keep you in suspense for the full duration. unlike in most other hollywood films the twists in the storyline are very well executed and it is in no ways cheesy or cheap. morgan freeman gives the performance of his life without making his fellow actors over-act. the shawshank redemption blows every other prison dramas out of the water. see it at all costs.seeing this movie twice i will admit that this movie does contain plot holes but overall it is still a highly enjoyable thriller with what i believe is some top notch acting both ben affleck and rosamund pike are great in their roles and both oscar worthy even tyler perry does a surprisingly great job in his role the  is a highlight worth mentioning in this review because it is amazing trent reznor and atticus ross did a superb job the soundtrack is amazing and should win an oscar because it is hauntingly powerful i recommend this movie for anyone willing to have a good time trying to witness a good thriller and great actingseeing shawshank as the imdb #1 did not surprise me a bit. this movie has the heart & soul to be a favourite for a long time to come. i like the reality of the unfairness of the whole situation. there is no glossing over the painful stuff. he was innocent but still jailed. he did get raped. his chance did get wiped out to have his story confirmed. what a waste. i read some people calling this a feel-good story. perhaps in the end but other than the relief of freedom there wasnt much to feel good about. talk about a hard-fought battle. and it isnt even over... his life is better than it was but still sucks considering everything he lost considering he can never go back considering he is always a fugitive... if youre feeling bummed out about your own life this is a good movie to watch to realize that things could always be worse.see the movie... it rocks its the best of the 3 and perfectly completes the trilogy. ill be seeing it again and again and again. after seeing it go back and watch the extended additions of 1 and 2. everything i saw in 1 and 2 makes total sense. cool foreshadowing of people and events too. i can hardly wait for the directors cut to come out  everyone is in dynamic form though it is perhaps jackson as the bible-bashing smart-mouthed hit-man jules who leaves the most lasting impression. his career post- pulp fiction has been quite simply a twenty year success story. theres an abundance of terrific individual scenes too _„_ the adrenalin- shot-to-the-heart sequence in which vincent saves mia from a drug overdose  the clean-up of marvins corpse after being accidentally shot by vincent  christopher walkens unforgettable single-scene cameo in which he describes the history of butchs gold watch_„_ it would take too long to list all of the films many wonderful vignettes  lets just say it overflows with great moments. different viewers will take from it their own particular favourites. if reservoir dogs hailed the emergence of a fiery raw talent in tarantino pulp fiction marks a quantum leap in style control and story-telling bravado. it remains a brilliant film only tarantinos second behind the cameras but still a strong contender for his best. samuel jackson john travolta  bruce willis - can this get any better  the dialogues are exquisite you will love the ezekiel 25:17 and will learn and say it every time u watch it  i can go on and on writing a review but all i really wanna say is please watch if youve watched it already then watch it again at any point of time if you find it confusing dont worry that would have happened to everyone  towards the end everything will be uncovered and there will be no questions unanswered left i can guarantee that anyone after watching this movie will not be disappointed and will become a quentin tarantino fan for life personally loved the soundtracks cheersrichard linklaters boyhood might be one of my favorite movies of all time it works because it shares mundane and even quotidian details about everyday life in a way that enabled me to relate and reflect on how things have worked out in my own life as a boy boyfriend man husband and father scene after scene i was moved by familiar things depicted in the story songs neighborhoods classrooms teachers public placesfood and even conversations to me the genius of linklaters 12year filming timeline is that he was able to show how peoples personalities remain fixed over time and yet life experiences operate to deepen and redeem our characters those who come to this film looking for abstraction or arthouse pretentiousness preciousness? will be disappointed but if you watch this movie with attention to how your heart is reacting to characters and their development in each scene you will be strangely warmed maybe even encouraged and certainly challenged by the simple questions life poses that often take years to answerrichard linklaters boyhood is the sort of movie i live for seldom does a movie significantly change the landscape of filmmaking in a way so grand in scope yet so simple in delivery boyhood is a movie that crafts the most realistic representation of life into the boundaries of a 165 minute film and it could have focused on just one aspect of life but instead it perfectly encapsulates the idea of what it is like to grow up the idea that everyone is familiar with and will most certainly relate to the movie is not just about one thing alone but in the end it is it is about life itself we follow young mason played extraordinarily by ellar coltrane from the age of 6 to his first day of college we do not have different actors playing the same characters each of the actors were filmed annually for 12 years there are no prosthetics no extensive makeup and no body doubles i could try to give you a brief summary of all the major things he experiences in his life but that would be taking away the magic of watching his life unfold before your very eyes almost every moment that you have experienced in lifeæ no matter how mundane or unimportantæ is up on screen for you to relive from times when your parent told you to actually talk about your day instead of saying it was ok to the talk to graduating college and leaving home to falling in love and falling out of love to that first day of school to making friends and losing friends and every moment you think you have forgotten boyhood has all these moments that might have seemed unimportant to us at the time but they appear as milestones in the life of mason coltrane is fantastic even at the age of 6 he is great his life is utterly absorbing we became entranced by his life even if nothing huge is happening we see him grow up in front of our eyes there really is no equal to this type of experienceæexcept maybe if you were to marathon all of the harry potter films he is continuously changing before our eyes his hair grows and is cut off he gets taller and gets piercings but although his appearance changes he remains the same type of person playing the older sister and getting far less recognition than coltrane is linklaters own daughter lorelei from early childhood to her teenage years she is the one who bugs her brother but also accompanies him along for the ride just like any good sibling would do his mother in the film played exceptionally by patricia arquette is a woman who is struggling to raise her two kids on her own she is flawed though she has a hot temper and continuously picks the wrong man but she is what a mother should be thoughtful and caring she cares for her children and does whatever she can do to make it by and let them live a happy life his dad played by ethan hawke in one of his best roles though caring as he may be is divorced from their mother for obvious reasons he is always fun spontaneous and wants nothing but to be a family again he is always there for his weekends and always tries to show his kids the best time possible the film is set to what is essentially a greatest hits of the 2000s linklater who is famous for his soundtracks uses music in this movie as an indicator of the time from early scenes featuring brittney spears and coldplay to final moments with foster the people and arcade fire the movie contains an amazing soundtrack as someone who only just recently passed the age at the end of the film there are so many references to my childhood that makes this film hit even harder than it does for those older it is imbued with memories of watching dragonball z after school while laying on the floor playing halo with friends anxiously anticipating the next harry potter book talking about the possibilities of another star wars and many more anybody who has just started college should see this movie to see their childhoods flash before their eyes boyhood is basically shot in a series of episodes with each year or so being a new chapter in the story but there are no dramatic cuts to future scenes there are no subtitles that explain what year it is the years bleed together like they do for anyone we do not live life as a series of chapters we live at it as one long story not quite knowing where one chapter begins and the other ends and we are only given a brief glimpse in the life of a boy growing up by the end of the film i wanted to see more i wanted to see what he would do in his life who he would marry what his kids would be like i wanted to watch all the way up until his final moments but sadly that is an impossibility and we are left to wonder where life takes him twelve years ago making this movie must have seemed like a huge gamble there were so many things that could go wrong in 12 years someone could have died or quit funding could have fallen through or linklater could have realized what he was making was complete garbage there are a million reasons why this movie could not have worked out it somehow worked out perfectly and we are left with a truly cinematic masterpiece a movie that will go down as one of the best of the year maybe even of our generation it is a truly and wholly unique and magical experience it is a perfect movie ragingfilmcomrichard linklaters boyhood is the sort of movie i live for seldom does a movie significantly change the landscape of filmmaking in a way so grand in scope yet so simple in delivery boyhood is a movie that crafts the most realistic representation of life into the boundaries of a 165 minute film and it could have focused on just one aspect of life but instead it perfectly encapsulates the idea of what it is like to grow up the idea that everyone is familiar with and will most certainly relate to the movie is not just about one thing alone but in the end it is it is about life itself we follow young mason played extraordinarily by ellar coltrane from the age of 6 to his first day of college we do not have different actors playing the same characters each of the actors were filmed annually for 12 years there are no prosthetics no extensive makeup and no body doubles i could try to give you a brief summary of all the major things he experiences in his life but that would be taking away the magic of watching his life unfold before your very eyes almost every moment that you have experienced in lifeÜ no matter how mundane or unimportantÜ is up on screen for you to relive from times when your parent told you to actually talk about your day instead of saying it was ok to the talk to graduating college and leaving home to falling in love and falling out of love to that first day of school to making friends and losing friends and every moment you think you have forgotten boyhood has all these moments that might have seemed unimportant to us at the time but they appear as milestones in the life of mason coltrane is fantastic even at the age of 6 he is great his life is utterly absorbing we became entranced by his life even if nothing huge is happening we see him grow up in front of our eyes there really is no equal to this type of experienceÜexcept maybe if you were to marathon all of the harry potter films he is continuously changing before our eyes his hair grows and is cut off he gets taller and gets piercings but although his appearance changes he remains the same type of person playing the older sister and getting far less recognition than coltrane is linklaters own daughter lorelei from early childhood to her teenage years she is the one who bugs her brother but also accompanies him along for the ride just like any good sibling would do his mother in the film played exceptionally by patricia arquette is a woman who is struggling to raise her two kids on her own she is flawed though she has a hot temper and continuously picks the wrong man but she is what a mother should be thoughtful and caring she cares for her children and does whatever she can do to make it by and let them live a happy life his dad played by ethan hawke in one of his best roles though caring as he may be is divorced from their mother for obvious reasons he is always fun spontaneous and wants nothing but to be a family again he is always there for his weekends and always tries to show his kids the best time possible the film is set to what is essentially a greatest hits of the 2000s linklater who is famous for his soundtracks uses music in this movie as an indicator of the time from early scenes featuring brittney spears and coldplay to final moments with foster the people and arcade fire the movie contains an amazing soundtrack as someone who only just recently passed the age at the end of the film there are so many references to my childhood that makes this film hit even harder than it does for those older it is imbued with memories of watching dragonball z after school while laying on the floor playing halo with friends anxiously anticipating the next harry potter book talking about the possibilities of another star wars and many more anybody who has just started college should see this movie to see their childhoods flash before their eyes boyhood

forever a lot of hearts got touched because in a way we felt what we couldnt feel again childhood and to see all difficulties in life was worth going through what mason been through is what millions others went through just seeing time fly by and things change for better or worse or even the same life is stages every stage is different husbandsfriendseven kidsand in very strange way life is beautiful what a moviebest movie of 2014 with no doubtfull of lifefull of memories masterpiecerichard linklater brings us the juggernaut that is boyhood boyhood is a roller coaster of emotion and sentiment seen through the eyes of a young boy over a span of 12 years the film has a very intimate feeling that i have never experienced watching any other film it was hard not to relate to mason through out some parts of his life goodbyesfirst loveslost friendships and a constant struggle with the world around you boyhood is a once in a lifetime film a movie where time is real a film where we get to watch these characters grow making them feel like they are a part of our own world certain people dont seem to praise boyhood as much as other reviewers and critics have probably because there are no intense hollywood esque moments where a character gets an epiphany from the heavens everything in boyhood feels very real and personal making it a very intimate and beautiful to watch a journey like nothing ever seen in filmreturn of the king is one of those rare movies that i have so much trouble coming up with a decent review because im absolutely speechless. return of the king is also one of the rare films that actually surpass the hype. i have rarely been so emotionally exhausted in my life time. its a known fact that i dislike fellowship but adored two towers so i had high hopes for this one. return of the king has so much action going on its honestly hard to keep up. there is something going on at every turn with unbearable suspense. all the characters are even better this time around especially frodo. i was amazed at some of the selfishness he had this time around instead of the goody two shoes routine he usually did it made for some really gripping suspense. the performances are absolutely incredible for the most part everybody has truly grown up. i avoided the lord of the ring series for so many years because of the constant over hype people gave the series. well its nice to be proved wrong once in a while and return of the king especially shut me up but quick. bottom line. return of the king is a masterpiece plain and simple. its one of the best movies in the history of cinema and i thank peter jackson for giving me 3 or so hours of wonderful cinema. the two towers is a masterpiece itself but it does not compare to the brilliance of this one. even if you arent a fan of the genre this is still an absolute must watch. 10/10respect to the art of cinema by mr tarantino the cast comes out of muthology and the soundtrack out of heaven once in a lifetime there is a combination of this fact be well if you saw that movie in a life changing period the powerful overdose of xtreme i dont care - life is now scenes of the film in addition to almost ingenious screenplay comes to fit the perfect choices of music so cast full text full music full and here comes mr quentin lets play cut move cut move cut cut move time is only a line yeah watch me directing all the other stuff i dont remember now its like a fairytale i watch it every monday before sleeping mondays are tough days be wellrecently i had one of the greatest cinematic experiences of my life i delved into richard linklaters wonderfully organic and profoundly moving masterpiece boyhood for those of you unfamiliar with the film boyhood chronicles the life of mason played by ellar coltrane as he wades through childhood from ages seven to eighteen sounds like the plot to a movie weve seen a few thousand times right? wrong boyhood shatters all hollywood norms with groundbreaking style story and originality its unlike anything youve seen before for starters linklater actually shot the movie over twelve years following his actors as they age both in their roles and in real life since 2002 the cast of boyhood gathered for a few weeks each summer to film the next chapter of masons life its mindboggling watching coltrane literally mature on screen in a compression of his life since 2002 because of this the film doesnt feel like a movie at all but more like an epic poem or a series of subtle moments that collectively define what it means to be a boy in the 21st century this unique directorial style transcends our expectations of what a movie should be and allows linklater to explore the nuances of his characters like an author would in a great work of literature young

movie ive ever watched.... 10 times. this is a movie that from start to finish keeps you engaged like no other film. when it concludes you wonder how a 2 hour plus movie can go by so quickly. no bathroom breaks or snack breaks during this movie whether its the first time watching it or your tenth. just sat down and watched it again 2 nights ago with my daughter 12. she too never moved from the couch and loved the film. this film will hold up to the test of time because its simple: great writing great acting great directing and watchable over and over.read this loud and clear: pulp fiction will never ever happen again the impact the delivery the timing and the overall stamp it has placed in cinema history can never be duplicated see there are bad movies good movies great movies and trailblazers the trailblazers are films that jump-start a movement revolutionize the industry change the landscape of motion pictures and delivers an impact whether immediate star wars or down the road fight club that never exits the general consensus wizard of oz 2001: a space odyssey psycho jaws star wars raiders of the lost ark the graduate and goodfellas are all examples of films that are trailblazers none of these films have any contemporaries they are their own category and all films of similar genres become compared to them pulp fiction is a 90s indie trailblazer that absolutely altered the entire culture of movies by crafting what at the time was easily one of the most jarring unexpected stylish and wholesome cinematic experiences ever witnessed pulp fiction was a low-budget flick with such high aspirations that 1994 didnt know how to handle it the soundtrack among the best in film history the unexpected blend of violence drugs and realistic dialogue the surprises the utter lack of chronological order the style the tone and the overall look of pulp fiction made it stand out not just among the films of the 90s but everything preceding it it talks like a scorsese movie moves like a 1950s italian neorealism flick paces like a spaghetti western and breathes like an underground comic book come to life pulp fiction is tasty cinematic soup pulp fiction knew it was cool before the viewer did pulp fiction knew that its audience was going to put up with the 150 minutes of dialogue because the characters were so strong the story lines were unique and there were so many details explained and unexplained that it required multiple viewings to catch it all and jump-started urban legends and mysteries that remain unsolved to this day it was a movie that created its own culture and fanbase that would follow madman quinten tarantino for the entirety of his career---through the bad death proof and the good django unchained everything in this movie works the cast was downright phenomenal and nearly miraculous considering the budget bruce willis samuel l jackson john travolta and christopher walken in one movie the dialogue was sharp witty brutal and breathes life into each character you see within the pulp-influenced saga the directing by tarantino was practically flawless as he makes transforms the camera into a curious witness by mixing in a barrage of close-ups long shots and spastic movement that never feels like its framing a shot but more so just following the story along where ever the action was going this movie literally has it all: sex violence drugs rock n roll dancing singing crime morality issues romance revenge monologues potential miracles shootouts dark humor dozens of film references and even a couple glimpses of the california underworld that most people would rather not know about and all this was accomplished without a hollywood budget there was a slight sense of amateurism that gave the movie an edge like a black sheep in the meadows of the film industry this would inspire an entire wave of budding ambitious and hopeful filmmakers that also had their stories to tell and didnt want to cater to the typical hollywood output or abide by its rules pulp fiction is a b-movie setup executed like an underground masterpiece from the dialogue-heavy start to the sudden finish you cant duplicate this i couldnt duplicate this tarantino could never duplicate this pulp fiction is one of the greatest films ever made and a perfect storm of innovative filmmaking that lifted 1994 into one of the best years of film that has ever existed---and launched an entire era of indie filmmaking that still has its effects on the industry today pulp fiction is as absolutely cool as its getsrather than dwell on any bad points - are their any i must have watched & tremendously enjoyed this film 6x in the last year and probably the equivalent every year since it was released tarantinos mark on all his films is evident - and yes its obvious hes using his childhood experience or dreams in his fantastic ability to make stunning films & to top it off the 360 filming of this piece is a pleasure to behold never ever get bored of the quality this artist delivers nor do my 16 & 18 year old sons one of the best directors & writers everquite simply tarantinos best and arguably the best film ever: pulp fiction with a star-studded cast and non-linear storyline to back up complex characters and realistic dialogue this film cannot easily be beat i have seen this film probably about 10 times and every time i learn something new: what pack of cigarettes butch smokes what the hell a palooka is the outrageous and sadistic ways of senorita villalobos etc this film is enticing at every turn with a soundtrack to die for and the goddess of editing ms sally menke it is simply amazing also the fact this epic was made for only 10 million dollars what film with 30 times that budget have trouble sticking in the same league as this piece what is all comes down to is the fact that quentin tarantino is the motion picture craftsmen of his generation and the best of the past 25 years sorry martyquite simply i think that this may be the greatest movie of all time. everyone had such high expectations and it didnt let them down. it delivered hardcore. give sean austin the oscar for best supporting actor nowquite simply dark knight is the best superhero movie ever made ok kickass is the only competitor but strictly speaking it isnt a proper superhero movie so lets forget about that. batman is tough batman is loved batman is weak batman is hated. batman has human characteristics. batmans enemies have human characteristics. this is the first and main reason dark knight succeeds. it isnt just a superhero movie. its also a study of character of good and of dark and of perception of society. i mean it does this so well i sometimes think the superhero content is just a scapegoat for the deeper thought in the movie even though i know at the same that its not. secondly batman doesnt do anything too unbelievable. look at superman hes flying. look at spiderman hes got webs coming out of his palms. look at the hulk he can get massive when he is angry. thats all cool and entertaining but batman is imo the superhero whom we can connect to the closest because he doesnt have these abilities about him which are soooo unrealistic. so both his inner and outer character are human like which makes the movie so much more enjoyable. the action the action in dark knight is amazing batmans car is amazing the special effects are amazing it is a phenomenal piece of work crafting a movie where it looks and feels fantastic i wont talk much about heath ledgers portrayal of the joker. its definitely his best performance ever and what better time to have it just before his death peace be upon him. i hate a ball watching the guy act. hes just created an insanely unique persona. i loved it everything in dark knight works. its got so much novelty to it. its a rare piece of cinema where prima facie its for kids but ultimately adults will end up enjoying it much more. dark knight isnt for kids anyway they wont be able to comprehend the bigger picture in dark knight which is what makes this movie so special. its cool its original its awesome i cant believe how it wasnt nominated for a best picture. oscars were probably too stunned at how good a super hero movie could be. did i mention i also love gary oldman the guy plays a different person in every movie i can never tell its himquite possibly one of the best films ever made in terms of writing acting and pop culture reference. the dialogue is brilliant and intelligent. i definately dug it the most bruce willis and christopher walkens segment was hilarious in spite of the fact of delicate subject matter. i also enjoyed the that is a tasty burger segment.quentin tarantinothat name is a guarantee for brilliant thrilling movies with excellent dialogues and so is pulp fiction samuel l jackson is the king as always but i also liked ving rames harvey keitel and tim roth christopher walken was great too despite of his very small partnot as small as that of steve buscemi pulp fiction is fast thrilling funny i am running out of compliments  o yeah i voted a 10quentin tarantinos pulp fiction not only is a fantastic achievement in film making it also conjured up such a different perspective of the potential of mainstream hollywood film a complex tale of murder humor and odd characters suffused with pop-culture references sharp and witty dialog fantastic acting a rollicking soundtrack of multiple different genres and ultimately an intriguing and game-changing story line directed almost flawlessly there are faults as in every film scattered here and there but they are subtle and even with a scrutinizing eye do not remove you from the experience of sitting and feasting your eyes upon this masterpiece on all fronts there is very little else that can be said about this film as everyone and their mothers has seen it hopefully not together bring out the gimp i envy those cave-dwellers who have yet to see it and i urge you to do so right nowquentin tarantinos pulp fiction is the most stylish film ever made. the title and front cover says it allquentin tarantinos pulp fiction is a work of postmodern art its unlike any film ive seen before and because of that i commend it for not searching for a blueprint or a formula to tell its story tarantino tells the story from pure originality and like many of his future films pulp fiction is told with a non-linear narrative making it hard to explain the plot its better to just introduce the characters and go from there the story is about very different people whose lives intertwine with one another over the course of a few days the characters first introduced are pumpkin roth and honey bunny plummer who are talking in a dinner with plans to conduct a heist we then cut to two detectives named vincent vega travolta and jules winnfield jackson who are trying to retrieve a briefcase they can bring to their boss marsellus wallace rhames wallace has his own chapter in the film as well him and prizefighter butch coolidge willis strike a deal where butch accepts a large amount of money to throw an upcoming fight while wallace is tied up in this deal vega goes over to meet and take to dinner the lovely mrs mia wallace thurman a series of events happen causing dismay among vega which lead to some very well-written and well-acted sequences being that the film is conducted in a very nontraditional style pulp fiction is a task to follow sometimes my advice  watch it and just go along with it if you feel inclined to look up how it played out on the internet go ahead or if you want to give it a rewatch that is fine too viewing multiple clips for a second time i think i finally understand it more but a lot of questions youll still be asking after repeated viewings one of the most famous questions is whats in the briefcase that is recovered by vega and winnfield in the early scenes of the film im sure when writing the film tarantino himself didnt know what he wanted to put in the briefcase im also sure he didnt think it would blow up into such a debacle on the message boards and through word of mouth what truly makes pulp fiction worthwhile is the genius dialog tarantino cranks out the best script possible combined with enough wit and violence to please the most demanding and picky action-film fan one moment the two are discussing why a quarter pounder with cheese from mcdonalds is called a royale with cheese in france next they are threatening violence if a victim asks the question what again why do i not condone constant swearing and gratuitous violence in other films but for some reason award a perfect  to a film that is made up of it because pulp fiction shows how it should be done it depicts realistic situations handled intelligently and with wit and soul it doesnt utilize them for the purpose of being monotonous or dreary but to advance an already crafty storyline the character are under such stress it only makes sense that they are constantly shouting four letter words is it necessary not really but pulp fiction isnt just about swearing it proves that true cinema still exists and that even a story that appears choppy and inconsistent on paper can still produce one of the best films of the decade starring: john travolta samuel l jackson uma thurman harvey keitel tim roth amanda plummer maria de medeiros ving rhames eric stoltz rosanna arquette christopher walken bruce willis and quentin tarantino directed by: quentin tarantino quentin tarantinos pulp fiction 1994 shows us

weird twisted wayand the way they talk the dialogue they use is really something elsethe movie won an oscar for best writing tarantino roger avary and was nominated for several othersat cannes film festival tarantino got a palme dorand it got several other awards but i dont bother to mention them allthis is a movie you just cant missif you dont want to be a dork  the serious violence of american gangster movies crime movies and films noirs mixed up with the wacky violence of cartoons video games and japanese animation  and the fragmented story-telling structures of such experimental classics as citizen kane rashomon and la jetÍ©e the oscar-winning script by tarantino and roger avary intertwines three stories featuring samuel l jackson and john travolta in the role that single-handedly reignited his career as hit men who have philosophical interchanges on such topics as the french names for american fast food products  bruce willis as a boxer out of a 1940s b-movie  and such other stalwarts as harvey keitel tim roth christopher walken eric stoltz ving rhames and uma thurman whose dance sequence with travolta proved an instant classic quentin tarantinos final breaktrough is the best movie ever made i cant imagine a better script than this the actors are giving their best and music is fantastic personality goes a long wayquentin tarantino rules and pulp fiction is his most fabolous masterpiece everything seems perfect and nothing is left aside it has got it all pulp fiction easely gets number 2 on my favourite movielist people that calls themselves movie lovers but who dont like pulp fictions can as well stop watching moviesquentin tarantino is the jerry lee lewis of cinema a pounding performer who doesnt care if he tears up the piano as long as everybody is rocking. his new movie pulp fiction is a comedy about blood guts violence strange sex drugs fixed fights dead body disposal leather freaks and a wristwatch that makes a dark journey down through the generations. seeing this movie last may at the cannes film festival i knew it was either one of the years best films or one of the worst. tarantino is too gifted a filmmaker to make a boring movie but he could possibly make a bad one: like edward d. wood jr. proclaimed the worst director of all time hes in love with every shot - intoxicated with the very act of making a movie. its that very lack of caution and introspection that makes pulp fiction crackle like an ozone generator: heres a director whos been let loose inside the toy store and wants to play all night.quentin tarantino is one of the greatest directors of all time. it is not a coincidence therefore that pulp fiction one of his most well recognized and known movies is one of the best movies of all time. between the eclectic and comedic plot and the supreme group of actors that tarantino used for the movie it is inarguable otherwise. for many people for instance some of my friends who have watched pulp fiction the plot is a negative. these people have got to be type as who require a structured and well planned plot with a more developed and organized background and character set. they usually think this because the movie simply picks up at different places and is not in chronological order. the movie also introduces characters to the audience without any name background or insight into the character. these two things can most easily be seen in the beginning and middle of the movie. in the beginning when the honey-bunny scene is introduced for the first time it is easy for the audience to be dumbfounded and confused as to what the movie is about and who the characters are. the audience may also be confused in the middle of the movie when marsellus wallace is talking to butch. there are no obvious indications as to who the two men are. the audience has to draw from context clues that the black man is marsellus wallace and that butch is a boxer who is supposed to go down for him. it is easy to see that this may irk somebody who has a type a personality. to me however this is a very positive and refreshing aspect of pulp fiction. movies are too predictable today. they present too many known and common variables. all of quentin tarantinos movies or at least most are unpredictable. this unpredictability is refreshing. the randomness especially in pulp fiction is positive new and makes watching the movie fun and exciting. much of the randomness factor in pulp fiction comes from random little extras that mean nothing to the plot of the movie. an example of this is when vince and mia are on the date and mia calls vince a square. but rather than saying square she outlines a square with her fingers in the air and lines follow her fingers on the screen. another random yet comedic part of the movie is when butch comes home to his girlfriend fabienne and she says she wants a pot belly. this is where the audience first learns that fabienne is quite weird and oblivious. besides these two scenes there are many other strange little jokes or bizarre piece of humor intertwined into the movie. an excellent example of this is when butch learns that the watch he receives from his dead fathers comrade was kept inside both of their rectums. of course the vocabulary tarantino uses for these for these scenes is quite vulgar but the vulgarity adds to the hilarity factor. the actors are also part of what makes pulp fiction as good a movie as it is. tarantino usually uses many of the same actors especially uma thurman and christopher walken. thurman plays mia and walken plays a more minor role. besides thurman and walken many acting greats including john travolta bruce willis and samuel l. jackson take major roles. in my opinion pulp fiction is the best movie i have seen bruce willis play in as he does not play some cheesy clichÍ© character with clichÍ© lines like in all the die hard movies. john travolta also plays his role very well as he also does not take himself too seriously. samuel l. jackson in many aspects is the funniest and best character of the movie. his violent rants and outbursts are hilariously awesome and challenge his famous go the _____ to sleep. pulp fiction also leaves the audience with questions. the biggest question is what is in the suitcase. all that is known about the contents of the suitcase is that they glow orange and that marsellus wallace is the owner and needs them back. the audience also gets to see that anybody looking at the contents freezes and stares when they see what is inside. when i saw the movie for the first time i thought that the content was gold bars which may explain the orange glow that hits characters faces when they opened up the suitcase. but after investigation on the internet unaware that the subject was of hot debate i learned that tarantino wanted the suitcase to hold diamonds but used diamonds in another movie so he just did not show the contents at all. it is these small mysteries that add interest and debate over the quality of movies. because of the actors hilarity and mystery in pulp fiction it can be considered one of the best movies of all time. tarantino did not disappoint with this 1994 movie. he intrigued many with a more artist and abstract way of making plots and directing movies.quentin tarantino has to be one of the best directors of the 90s and pulp fiction is without doubt one of the best films ever made this film also has one of the best casts ever assembled the list of big names is endless if you havent seen this film then you need to watch it as soon as you can you will not be disappointed how it won just one oscar i will never know it defiantly deserved more in my opinion if i had to describe it in one word it would be cool from samuel l jacksons speech to john travolta and uma thurmans dance when all the story lines come together it is magnificent and it is one of the few films that deserves a 10 star ratingquentin tarantino has one the most brilliant minds ever not only does he make great movies but he always finds a way to keep you interested in whatever it is that going on exception jackie brown which is a review ill save for a day when i have time to complain about how awful it was so as i was saying tarantino is a brilliant and i think the way he lays the story out in this particular movies couldnt have been any better he had the perfect cast to pull of what i believe to be the best movie of that particular year i honestly thought when i first saw this film that samuel l jackson and john travolta were going to be a horrible match side by side but the scenes with those two are what made me love the movie so much willis and rhames scenes were great too the situation they were in was kinda effed up but none the less entertaining the only time i lost any interest in this movie was when uma thurman had her moment of glory but when she overdosed it kinda pulled me back into what was going on weird i know but back to my point the movie was great and i give it a 10/10 i know this isnt a great review but im not good at this kind of stuff so bite mequentin tarantino at his best this movie is mostly dialogs but it is so well written that you never get bored and it has the best product placement ever royal cheese :p this movie is great and still to this day one of my all time favorite movies amazing acting dialogues and screenplay each character has their own story and they are all likable characters and stories arent superifical they are in dept and likable it may not have a great message or anything but it is a great movie nonetheless also it is great to see bruce willis trying to act in a great non action movie they should do a lot more movies togetherpulp fiction. its the answer you give when a child comes running up to you and asks what is cinema. its the definition you give to someone when they question cool style and most of all pure entertainment. from its pulp visuals to flawless direction superb screenplay to mesmerising characters its better than the best sex you will ever have. endlessly quotable and watchable captivating making every turn more exciting than the last. more than a experience but a passage into life because if you aint a bad mother f****r then you aint sh*tpulp fiction where do i even begin to review a film like pulp fiction let me just start out by saying that i have never seen another film like pulp fiction this was my first quentin tarantino film and in my opinion none of his other films have even come close to this masterpiece one of the greatest things about this film and also something that sets it apart from most any other movie is that it revolves around the dialogue the conversations between characters in pulp fiction are unlike any conversations between characters that i have ever seen in a film because they are absurdly realistic this film is the most quotable movie i have ever seen to the point where the last scene of the film i know almost every line usually if a film tries to revolve around the dialogue it ends up being really boring this is because not many directors can do dialogue the way that quentin tarantino does dialogue the acting in this movie is also incredible this is my favorite role that samuel l jackson has played jules winnfield and also my favorite role of john travoltas vincent vega as well as my favorite role of uma thurman mia wallace and tim roth ringo there is not one weak performance in pulp fiction tarantinos non-linear non-story based masterpiece is the most unique film that i have ever seen it is entirely left up to your own interpretation nothing in this film is explained for you you are free to think of it however you want and make up your own stories once you see the film you will no doubt be left with questions such as what is in the briefcase one of the longest standing questions asked of a film people try to come up with the answer but the truth is that there is no answer the answer is whatever you want it to be never before have i seen a film that leaves so much up to the viewers interpretation and does it so well if you do not see this movie you are missing out on one of the best movies ever made and possibly the most unique film that you will ever see this quentin tarantinos masterpiece by far pulp fiction obviously gets a 10 out of 10pulp fiction turns a lot of people off at first with its violence and its nonlinear plot but on subsequent viewings the movie improves by leaps and bounds. every time you watch it you will catch more nuances you will recognize the skill of craftsmanship that went into making this film. im not even talking about tarantino even though i feel this is his best. watch how many details the actors put into their roles the small gestures and looks that make the dialogue sizzle. samuel jackson and uma thurman are obvious standouts and tim roth and harvey keitel are also quite good. christopher walken steals the show with the most memorable single-appearance role in recent history. so even if you didnt care for it the first time give it another try. and if you liked it the first time buy a copy and watch it until it wears out like mine just didpulp fiction truly changed my life the fragmented presentation of the movie in stories superb dialogue the fact that the settings and characters are just so cool and many other film-making touches makes this movie magnificent it made me realise actually how much i love movies the first aspect to take note of when you watch the movie will be when you see the cast at the time seeing john travoltas name acting as the supposed leading role in the film saw the resurgence of his career and he acted brilliantly its the one role he plays where on sometimes forgets its the famous john travolta acting enthusiasts of other tarantino films will recognise harvey keitel tim roth from his other works and if one is really sharp steve buscemi and even christopher walken samuel l jackson was to show the world how good an actor he is in this movie also amongst the cast names in the opening credits at the very end after about 12 names comes bruce willis last undoubtedly not least a noticeable touch the script is of epic proportions tarantino and avary created stories which especially the last two can be appreciated in many ways with powerful significance dialogue is superb throughout bringing both astute humour and reality to the picture the music chosen surely makes the soundtrack one of the best of all time i love and appreciate literally every shot in the movie there is only one line in the film i dont like when rachel talks back to say good night rachel is the only part of the entire film i dont like and the line fits perfectly with the character i just hate the character the more you watch this film the more one gets out ive seen it over 50 times and i get something new out of it almost every time from script interpretations to things one doesnt have a chance to see or hear the first time it was made so that it would be appreciated for the multiple viewer there is much more i could add but most has all been said before ill end by saying seeing certain movies can bring great personal moments this movie can be seen as a great asset to the world of film in my opinion its the greatest ever madepulp fiction the magnum opus of quentin tarantino is an absolute visual treat the exemplary usage of nonlinear story-telling will leave the viewers open mouthed backed up by some very powerful performances by the cast the film has become a benchmark for all black comedy films the screenplay by tarantino artistically narrates the incidents concerning a particularly interesting group of people the film is replete with iconic moments like the monologue perfectly delivered by jules winnfield samuel jackson the twist dance routine of mia wallace uma thurman and vincent vega john travolta and the mexican standoff in a diner however this masterpiece is not recommended for the faint- hearted as a lot of r - rated violent scenes of great detail are interspersed in the film the soundtrack has been compiled quite tastefully misirlou sets a funky tone for the film during the opening credits structurally the film is divided into seven sequences which have connected stories as expected the cameo from tarantino himself as jimmie the distraught husband in arguably the most entertaining part of the film - the bonnie situation - proves to be the cherry on the cakepulp fiction movie review although i am only 18 years of age barely a legal adult i must firmly say the film pulp fiction directed by quentin tarantino is the best film i have ever seen hands down the screenplay and storyline of the movie is not only intense but deeply intriguing as well the balance which is struck so masterfully by tarantino to appeal to a wide variety of movie enthusiasts is what makes the movie spectacular being a self proclaimed tarantino fan the structure and flow of this movie reminds of his first ever film reservoir dogs the film was nominated for over 5 oscar awards but ended up winning only one best original script winning best original script is no small achievement this award is a testament to the quality and time that tarantino puts into each of his movies and the script and plot line in pulp fiction is no different additionally the film has some of the best actors in the modern era starring in the movie the star cast includes samuel l jackson john travolta bruce willis uma thurman tim roth and ving rhames jackson and travolta team up in the movie to play a pair of hit men contracted to certain jobs by their boss ving rhames bruce willis plays the other hit men that has a personal beef with the boss of jackson and travolta uma thurman stars as the wife of ving rhames finally roth plays the psychotic husband of the couple that holds up the diner at the end of film each of the main actors in the movie have won at least two awards for their performances in prior films showing the quality of each actor together all six of them mesh beautifully to create a smooth yet emotional film after receiving what seemed like no praise or appreciation from the media pulp fiction finally won an oscar best screenplay this is by far the most original and well made film that i have ever seen many people have said that because the movie switches scenes and plot lines so much that the movie is unorganized and has no true story line i couldnt disagree with this statement more the way that the directors mesh the different scenes and plot lines of the movie is what makes the film legendary for example the main storyline in the movie is the combination of jules winfield samuel l jackson and vincent vega john travolta two hit men that work for marcellus ving rhames at times the film will show the two men carrying out hits extorting money or extracting information by all means necessary one of the prime examples of this is the apartment scene in which jackson and travolta enter the apartment of a handful of young men believed to be holding cash and information after they ask a few questions poke around for a bit and find what they need they make sure that all of the men are dead preventing them from causing future problems this is meant to show the business savvy side of travolta and jackson and evoke intense emotion from the viewer but in the next scene a completely different type of john travolta is shown which is what makes his character so dynamic and appealing to the audience as travolta and jacksons boss leaves town his boss mia uma thurman asks travolta to take her on a date both of them are clearly high on drugs when they meet making for an interesting line of action travolta takes her to a 1950s diner which doubles as a dance club at night as the scene progresses thurman volunteers them for a dance much to the dismay of travolta travolta reluctantly accepts following thurman to the stage the dance goes well as the two perform beautifully and receive a standing ovation from the crowd but this is just the beginning of a disastrous night as the two leave the diner they return to thurmans house as travolta goes to the bathroom mia discovers a bag of heroin which she mistakes to be cocaine as travolta comes back to the living room he finds her lying on the ground motionless with blood running down her nose this leads travolta to believe that it is an od travolta brings thurman to a friends house where she is administered an adrenaline shot straight to the heart this sequence of the film is a prime example of balancing slow suspenseful action with intense on the edge of your seat emotion no other director has the talent or formula to combine drama action mystery and suspense all into one screenplay besides tarantino grossing over $107000000 lifetime many fans and movie enthusiasts agree with me as well boxofficemojocom each time i watch the movie i realize that it is one of the few films that i can enjoy every single time the legendary actors skillful directing and balance of several different plot lines creates a masterpiece in my opinion that is why pulp fiction is the greatest film of all timepulp fiction may be one of the most profoundly misunderstood films of our time one critic even called it a glorification of two whacked out hit-menothers called it flippant nihilistic and cynical yet others took the bizarre line that no film should be made about such worthless characters yet others called it plotless and formless however a careful viewing of tarantino s film should reveal that  like most of the pulp fiction  on which it is based it is indeed profoundly moral even more tarantinos film earnestly grapples with spiritual issues tarantino has carefully studied the films of dreyer and bresson as well as those of don spiegel and phil karlson to make my case for the spiritual -and moral core of this film i will merely call attention to the ending of each of its three episodes each one ends with a human life or lives being saved yes  there is cynicism flippancy and studied coolness in pulp fiction however this is merely the glossy packaging in which tarantino has concealed his profoundly-and rigorously- moral and spiritual message this is a film about redemptionpulp fiction is unique in the sense that it is the product of an unusually harmonious striking a perfect proportionality of all its parts and components and despite the fact that many of the elements of the artistic fabric of the film instantly served as an object for imitation are boldly innovative in themselves an indelible impression colorful characters cohort any of the frame is decorated with a great sense of style is remembered outstanding color scheme the rhythm seems alive the acting is striking naturalness and yet well thought-out every word and gesture etc but in the first place among the findings must include a sparkling amazingly witty inventive and uninhibited speech that pours from the screen caused by the special delight of critics it seems there is no such subject from mediocre household to profound which would not have been affected by the authors one way or another  it sounded hamlet words words words can achieve several important goals being both highly functional with respect to the action means of expressing the authors position at last so full of genuine poetry excellent movie of the ones i was looking for the last time good nice story that despite his ahem old age does not meet these films on the subject the dialogs in the film as well as the reaction of the characters in the stimulus by themselves are worth seeing the film in general if you have love for the action comedy with uninfected good emotion - this movie is for you _ film that wants to revise again and againpulp fiction is undoubtedly a masterpiece this movie single handedly got me interested in film making and movies themselves quentin tarantino writes directs and acts in what is hands down my favorite movie before watching this movie i have never experienced such joy in listening to characters interact with witty dialogue this credit of course go to tarantino writing in my opinion the best script ever my favorite part about the movie though are the characters tarantino brings them to life so well and effectively that it is unlike anything ive ever seen john travoltas performance revived his career and morphed him into a formidable movie star this film really put samuel l jackson on the map other performances that stand out to mealthough all are great are bruce willis and harvey keitel keitels character is so quick and hilarious with his lines yet so serious and believable the bonnie situation is my favorite sequence in the movie bruce willis gives the best performance of his career many will remember him for being a bad ass in die hard but i will remember him being a bad ass in pulp fiction finally the mixed up sequences and various interpretable themes make this movie great the briefcase and jules speech at the end are just fantastic this movie will always be my favoritepulp fiction is trully one of the best movies of the 90s its wondarfully made and entertaining from begining to end its not a standardly played movie instead its not in sequence and comes together at the end its trully ogininal the performances are also great my favorite being john travoltas if you havent seen this movie see it at once it will be a classicpulp fiction is the 2nd film directed by one of the greatest filmmakers of all time quentin tarantino it won an oscar for best dialogue and was beaten for best picture by forrest gump pulp fiction tells the story of two mob hit men played by john travolta and samuel l jackson a mob boss played by ving rhames the mob bosss wife played by uma thurman and a boxer played by bruce willis every single actor/actress in this film plays the role brilliantly especially samuel l jackson the part which makes this film so good is its dialogue about 90% of this film is just people sitting around talking but the dialogue is so well written and interesting you could sit and watch them for hours this film deserved its oscar by miles all those who go into this film expecting lots of shoot outs and explosions are not going to be impressed due to its long dialogue heavy scenes it has no philosophical messages or parts where you need to read between the lines if you want a film like that then i suggest you go and watch something directed by stanley kubrick its a straight up entertaining film which you dont even need to watch all the way through once youve watched it a few times this film will go down in cinematic history as one of the greatest films of all time in my opinion it is the greatest film of all time along with schindlers listpulp fiction is tarantino`s second movie and it is even better than reservoir dogs pulp fiction has stars like john travolta bruce willis harvey keitel and samuel l jackson all those actors in a low-budget gangster movie tarantino`s script is fantastic with lots of great characters weird situations great dialogue and violence pulp fiction brought travolta`s carreer back on track and its easy to see why travolta does a marvellous job as the gangster vincent vega allmost of the actors are great in this movie 10/10pulp fiction is simply the best movie that i have ever seen i can watch it again and again and it never gets old quentin tarantino is obviously a genius and bruce willis and samuel l jackson put in some of their best performances an interesting thing to do is to watch the movie and then try to figure out the chronological order of the plotpulp fiction is quentin tarantinos follow-up to reservoir dogs his promising debut film it is simply an amazing film its a very intense fast-paced movie with alot of unusual characters played out by an outstanding cast the dialogue in this film is hilarious particularly john travoltas vincent and samuel l jacksons jules the big mac scene is a classic the screenplay won a well-deserved oscar the story is complex there were alot of things i noticed on future viewing that id missed the first time probably because i was laughing too hard the cast is large and features alot of top actors: travolta jackson uma thurman ving rhames bruce willis and many others in smaller roles christopher walken makes a very brief but memorable appearance pulp fiction is a completly original film unlike anything ive ever seen it was chosen as one of the top 100 films by the afi its one of my favorite movies one i can watch over and over and not get tired of itpulp fiction is phenomenal on so many different levels. quentin tarantino is a truly talented director that goes to no end to make his films powerful beyond belief. pulp fiction is just one example of the many great ones. the moment you turn on pulp fiction you know youre in for quite a ride. this film has all the necessary components to make it exciting gangsters fights drug conflicts etc. this movie is so mind bending because of all the twists and turns and chapters it takes you on. to say this movie is complicated would be an understatement but when youre finished watching it you are left sitting there thinking how amazing it actually is. thurman travolta and jackson are just a few names whose acting make this movie what it is. you havent seen a great movie until youve watched pulp fiction.pulp fiction is one of those movies that gets to you every time you watch it. this film is hands down one of the greatest icons in the film industry. it structures out a plot through different stories at different occasions and brings a one line connection throughout the whole story. tarantino is not only my favorite film director but one of the most skilled at what he does. he provides an edgy plot with violence and references that happen in real life. although pulp fiction may be far fetched from actual reality but it still is a realistic fiction piece. the characters are well formed and controversial and has distinct personalities throughout. this film is by far my favorite and one of the most well written pieces the world has seen.pulp fiction is one of the two best films ive ever seen the first time ive seen the film was by chance but i found it great and have seen it 11 or 12 times againfor me its a real kultfilmgerman  you get hooked in their mindless conversations and invest in their characters the soundtrack will make you bob your head throughout the whole film and bobbing it hours after youve seen it its safe to say it is brilliant and really suits the film perfectly and when listened to sounds like it was perfectly made for a specific scene in the film this film quentin tarintino on the map as one of the directors to see because of the jazzy cool vibe his films have the directing is good with great uses of one shots and experimenting with transitions and angles such as the angle in which john travolta and samuel l jackson get their guns from the car boot but the main star of the film is the writing the writing is genius and flawlessly executed by the actors you will be quoting this film a couple of years after you see it if you pick any line from this film it will probably be a good one basically this film is a masterpiece and defined a genre that many writers will try to do pulp fiction is one of my two favorite movies ever w/fargo its just so funny and absurd and great my favorite scene would have to be either the twist contest or christopher walkens scene the best line is are youtalking to meon a cellular phone i dont know you im hanging up nowbad person prank caller its out of context here but its so funny when you see it so if you havent seen it go rent it right nowpulp fiction is my all-time favorite movie. ask me to list my reasons and i could go on and on about the acting characters dialogue or unexpected plot twists. but instead ive finally realized just why i love this movie so much. i started to obsess over pulp fiction after i went on the internet and read about all the things about pulp fiction i might have never realized by casually watching the movie: what was in the briefcase what ezekiel 25:17 means even little things like who keyed vincents car. what im trying to say is if you watched pulp fiction one or two times and didnt love it do a little internet research on this flick. believe me after you have read all there really is to the plot you will see three times the movie that you first thought was there and it will all make sense. in fact i only truly enjoyed pulp fiction the third time i watched it. but the plot is certainly not the only reason i love it. all of the characters are memorable and fit into the story like jigsaw pieces. you will ask yourself who the real main character was - samuel l. jackson john travolta ving rhames my little obsession with this movie has gotten to the point where ive taken a survey over who is better - jules or vincent to wrap it up - i believe pulp fiction is the greatest movie of the 90s and think that you should really indulge yourself in a bit of the trivia and make it a part of your world. then perhaps you will agree with me that its depth dialogue and characters make even movies such as forrest gump seem dim-witted and hurried.pulp fiction is movie making at its finest from the terrific acting esp samuel the witty script and the best soundtrack in a movie its got it all tarantinos best his let down was jackie brown i hope that he can try a different style of film next time but that aside this is definately one of the greatest of all time easily a 10/10pulp fiction is masterpiece by three reasons first reason is acting is doing very well by actors second reason is cinematography using tracking shot trunk shot close shot medium shot third reason is directing skills by quentin tarantino homage many scenes from breathlesswalking tall evil dead and many more of films i am not sure to mention it jules and vincent talk about what they called hamburgers of mcdonalds and in amsterdam quarters pounder with a cheese called in amsterdam is royale with a cheese big mac called in le big mac jules winfields ezekbiel 25:17 bible passage to brett before put bullet in himpulp fiction is hands-down one of the greatest movies ever made. the cinematography is excellent the characters deep the tale supension and the plot well-written. quentin tarantino has outdone all previous efforts with his exceptioal tale of two hitmen a boxer a suitcase and the wife of a mob leader. all in all a terrific film that everyone should own and watch multiple times. i tell ya there is so much to miss on the first viewing multiple viewings are mandatorypulp fiction is definitely the best movie ive ever seen it really has it all an excellent travolta and jackson a great performance by willis and probably the best performance ever by uma thurman i dont think tarantino will ever be able to do better then thispulp fiction is black comedy at its best and most twisted starting the film in the middle and going back to explain the inconsistencys i cant explain it without bursting out in manic laughter look out for a superb cast of john travolta samuel l jackson ving rhames bruce willis uma thurman and christopher walken watch out and fear of the arse-bandit zed and his pet gimp i must say no more go to your local video store and hire itpulp fiction is arguably quentin tarantinos masterpiece everything from the writing to the presentation is phenomenal the characters are enthralling the soundtrack is amazing and the movie itself is just incredible from top to bottom some would say its one of the most quotable movies of all time its one of those rare films that i can honestly say has no legitimate flaws ive seen it a thousand times and it never gets old tarantino captured the classic look he was going for from the visuals of the film to the sounds and cinematography that you would see from a much older movie the movie feels very authentic if you havent seen it then i suggest going out right now and buying yourself a copy of this masterpiecepulp fiction is an incredible non-linear dark-comedy crime film about two hit men a gangsters wife a boxer and two bandits all four tales intertwine into a story of loyalty betrayal violence and redemption pulp fiction was written and directed by the excellent quentin tarantino and stars john travolta samuel l jackson uma thurman and many more talented actors everything about this movie is fantastic the dialogue is superbly and brilliantly written it is one of the best movie scripts ever produced the soundtrack is perfect and fits the tone for this extremely original masterpiece pulp fiction also contains tremendous performances from leads john travolta and bruce willis to supporting acts like uma thurman and harvey keitel this stylistic thriller is one of the best movies of the 1990s and defined quentin tarantinos career with all the connected story lines and the interesting and intriguing screenplay pulp fiction is one of the most important movies of all time because of all the pros of this film it is still rewatchable and lives up to todays movie standards you are doing yourself a disservice if you havent seen tarantinos gem pulp fiction ten-outta-ten starspulp fiction is a very unique masterpiecethere has never been a movie like it before and there will never be another film like this. this film changed hollywood movie making forever by being original and audatious. the entire cast of this fiolm gives knockout performances especially samuel l. jackson who helps deliver some outstanding dialouge.pulp fiction is a masterpiece from start to finish. a couple of hard boiled stories are waved together by only such perfection as tarantino. now im not going to say that big q is my favorite director but there is no doubt that the man is a genius. just look at the script and just as in his other masterpiece reservoir dogs the scenes and scenarios are harshly mixed up in one big mess. as a director well hes good but not that very original with some exceptions like the pulp-dancesceen and the ending in dogs. his real magnificent lies in this adrenalin rush script. it is genius pulp fiction is my second favorite after star wars im not sure why i love that film but hey sue me and it cant be compared to the rest of my top-movies nor tarantinos others. from dusk till dawn is a big flat joke to this also natural born killers tarantinos story and probably true romance too. jackie brown is a good film but its one million floors down from this movie. the nearest so far is reservoir dogs. the direction of dogs was better than pulp but pulp fiction has got this screenplay that no other and i do mean not one has got. lets go on to... acting. well ill put it like this: a majority of the actors do their best roles ever here is my pulp fiction acting-guide: travolta: definitely his best role so far. his portrait of vince is a classic. its cool funny and you just smile by satisfaction while he slither around mrs.wallaces house. and the dancing-scene is also notable. here we see that travoltas dancing king age is still not over. jackson: its a hard choice but im pretty certain that this is his best performance ive seen. hes around everywhere so its tough but he tops. still its easier concidering the fact that his performance is the best in the movie the path of the ritcheus man is to be set on all sides... thurman: i have never been such a tremendous fan of uma thurman but this time were talking cool chick. it is a shame that shes only in like 1/5 of the movie. we should see more of her. keitel: no mr.wolf isnt his best. im rooting for mr.white or the priest in from dusk till dawn. i know its a crap movie but the role is good. roth: yeah mr.orange is better but this one is on a good 2nd place. rhames: his best role without a doubt. marcellus wallace were talking respect here. im gonna get medevil on your ass he is one tough bastard. his scene with willis was great and every other scene he was into in this great great movie. arquette: she isnt in this movie that much but it is by far her best performance. stoltz: eric stoltz is a great actor and i think every part he ever played is the best and im sorry that hes not in this one that much. willis: bruce willis might do his best performance and the most quality-role but i have a very hard time if ill ever try to forget john mcclane. this is his second best role. well lets not forget about eric roberts and quentin tarantino. or should we yes actually but lets try to focus on these two gentlemens too. ok roberts everybodys hate victim and the biggest c-actor since dolph lundgren. and tarantino might be a groovy director/writor but he actually is quite pale as an actor. pulp fiction has also got blood and violence. it is a strong foulmouth and shocking but also classic movie. if you really loved reservoir dogs... what are you waiting for i can guarantee yes i can make out a promise sue me if this is wrong that youll at least like this movie. also: great sound and cool soundtrack. i first saw this movie four years ago and it is still just as great. overall 10/10pulp fiction is a great movie that can bring generations together. my parents grandparents and even my younger siblings all enjoy getting to relax and enjoy this movie that will give you everything you want in a movie. for those who have a weak stomach or dislike movies with any blood at all i do not recommend. however if you are willing to suck it up and watch a movie where witty remarks are constant throughout the movie and have the possibility of making you think just a bit to understand what was meant by the characters. this movie is one of my favorites because it does a fabulous job convincing and getting you to suspend your disbelief. i will never forget the first time i watched pulp fiction and listened to the logic of robbing a cafÍ©. from that moment i knew that this was going to be a well done and fantastic movie that could compel me to believe what was going on and fear for the characters within this world of pulp fiction.pulp fiction is a 1994 crime-drama directed and written by quentin tarantino staring jon travolta and samuel l jackson as two bamfs and bruce willis as butch let me just say before i dig into this that i have a massive bias to this movie ive seen pulp more than any other movie in fact the reason why i even took this class in the first place can be directly linked to my admiration for pulp that being said tarantino really showed that hes got game in this film many people say that hes just a really big fan simply steals shots from other directors and one can certainly see the similarities between the shots but tarantino manages to make it his own every time even if the set up is exactly the same the shots he uses are able to stay tarantino- esque its also hard to point out one particular thing in this movie that stands out as the cinematography editing sound story acting and even the wardrobe stands out what makes this movie different from the rest is the non-conventional showing of the story its non-linear its almost aggressively non-linear for years ive been trying to figure out what the order in which the stories are told mean im sure theres something there but i havent really been able to figure it out that being said though it doesnt hold the movie back at the end of the day this movie is everything a good movie could be go watch it go obsess over it go talk about it go go go 10/10pulp fiction has everything that you can want from a movie: a great story with great characters great actors a great director & 2 hours and 40 minutes of film that keeps you glued to the screen. quentin tarantino brilliantly weaves together 3 stories to make a film that is a true masterpiece. the dialogue is truly excellent and the acting from samuel l. jackson john travolta uma thurman bruce willis ving rhames and many others is outstanding. i highly recommend this film and give it 10/10 stars.pulp fiction definitely is a knockout film apart from the intelligent original and refreshing chronological intertwine of different storylines the brilliant script is a gem it succeeds in making the mix of absurdly gross and directly shot violence and all day chit-chat more than believable where else have you seen a guy commenting on the quality of his victim-to-bes kahunaburger and asking him a sip of his beverage to wash it down seconds before pumping everyone in the room full-o-lead  when did you last see a scene in which one of the 2 bad guys accidently erase their captives brains during a car ride and then discuss the mess it creates the bump in the road that caused this and whos supposed to clean up without worrying even the slightest about the mans death  not to speak of walken in a small role handing willis the watch that according to his monologue sat years in someones there-where-the-sun-dont-shine before being handed on without being completely unbelievable  all this completed with a cool worth-wile soundtrack very retro-sixties/seventies a great well-picked cast and the magic tarantino touch this movie rockspulp fiction continues to top lists of the best movies ever it continues to mesmerize everybody that sees it it continues to be seen as the best movie the cast has ever been in and the best movie tarantino ever directed people that either watch movies on occasion or watch movies as hobbies love this people with thorough knowledge of film love it even more i would consider pulp fiction to be the best film of the 1990s beating out other classic in that decade such as schindlers list and terminator 2 like most tarantino films he does not put everything in chronological order that is a genius movie on his behalf that forces the viewer to stay until the end even those very very very few that dont like pulp fiction were obligated to stay till the end that is also what made tarantinos first movie reservoir dogs so thrilling also tarantino shows his knack for awesome dialogue that only he can deliver pulp fiction has three parallel story lines: the first deals with a couple called ringo and pumpkin tim roth amanda plummer that are also thieves they open up the film discussing the pros and cons of robbing a restaurant the scene is brief but the characters and dialogue is memorable vincent vega and jules winfield john travolta samuel l jackson are two hit men sent to retrieve a briefcase for their boss marcellus wallace ving rhames containing a golden object that is not shown nor told another genius movie on tarantinos behalf a few deaths and survivals along the way have them questioning their beliefs this is probably the funniest story pulp fiction has sometimes been labelled as a dark comedy this is the story with most of its elements this also has the one with the best and grittiest look soon after the incident vincent is asked to entertain wallaces wife mia uma thurman while he is out of town they have a good time until she overdoses on heroin that vincent got from his drug dealer lance eric stoltz although a small story the dialogue is just as sick as in the other stories and the character development is very deep although this is the only bit with mia she is developed deeper and stronger than many characters in full films the last is about club fighter butch coolidge bruce willis wallace pays him a hefty sum to throw a fight but after having a crazy dream bets the money on himself and fights so hard that he kills his opponent he goes on the run with his girlfriend maria de medeiros from wallace this is the story with the most excitement and the least amount of comedy some bits are shocking but all fit together bruce willis as butch is just as badass and heroic as john mcclane as i mentioned earlier the all stories are done out of order but are all tied in in a very intelligent way writing memorable dialogue like this is very hard creating awesome characters is even harder while making the movie look good and putting it out of order is the easy part pulp fiction has everything a good movie should have to the extreme that barely any other have achieved only tarantino could do a movie this goodpulp fiction begins with a pitch and ends with a homerun the movie from start to finish is one great roller coaster ride it will make you laugh at most with the close to real life dialogue the chemistry between the characters in the movie especially john travolta and samuel jackson john travolta and uma thurman tim roth and amanda plummer and bruce willis and maria de medeiros will keep you highly entertained at the end of the movie you will only wish it never ended the quirky dialogue combined with the fast paced violence is just as good as mixing gin with tonic quentin tarantinos style has influenced a legion of film directors throughout the nineties including bryan singer james mangold and paul thomas anderson he pretty much shaped the decade of movies with pulp fiction reservoir dogs true romance and jackie brown and popularized independant movies all around pulp fiction is the best movie i have ever seen watching this movie alone is what a real movie-watching experience is all about i give it a solid 10 and no competition whatsoever by any other movie watch it yourself and you will know what i meanpulp fiction 1994 rating: 10/10 one of the most famous movies of the 1990s pulp fiction is a graphic crowd-pleasing shocking and awesome crime drama that boasts more astonishing ideas than any movie i can remember for the 1990-1995 period this is quite simply a masterpiece with poignancy comedy and sheer brilliance packed into one big explosive movie that well never forget not only one of the best films of 1990s pulp fiction also gives us one of the most ensemble casts in a film ever picture this: rosanna arquette samuel l jackson john travolta tim roth bruce willis christopher walken uma thurman ving rhames and eric stoltz all of them give great performances and all are amazing actors what acting heaven but thats not the best thing about the movie believe it or not the script is quentin tarantino and roger avary breathtaking descriptive and unexplainably excellent screen-writing skills are _„_ i just cant explain it the script is so good itll knock your socks off quentins direction is also very worthy of praise  he dares to go the next step in filmmaking and wins the audience over due to the extreme amount of violence drugs language and sexuality i strongly advise the faint-hearted and children to keep way away from this movie otherwise if you dont mind a bit of naughty fun and a huge exciting spark in your movie-life then see this now pulp fiction is definitely an experience you wont forget easily pulp fiction 1994 is the type of film you can see multiple times and still notice new things the characters are deep and the story is enthralling tarantino uses discontinuity editing and the story is told out of order each story is told as its own movie and the details of the characters are deep a movie about a crime boss and his hit men is sure to be filled with violence and pulp fiction is no exception scenes are murder kidnapping and even a homosexual rape appear in the film tarantino loves to push the limits and he does so in pulp fiction arguably his best filmpulp fiction 1994 is a crime film directed by quentin tarantino the film contains several separate stories that are presented in a non-chronological order the major characters are vincent vega john travolta and butch coolidge bruce willis vince is mob hit man working for boss marsellus wallace ving rhames vince and partner are given the task of recovering a briefcase for their boss the briefcase is highly valued and marsellus will stop at nothing to obtain it butch is an aging boxer in debt to the mob given an opportunity to make some cash butch accepts a request by marsellus to throw an upcoming fight allowing marsellus a guaranteed winning payout on a bet at the last moment butch has a change of heart and must flee with his ill-founded cash tarantinos pulp fiction can be considered a modern day film noire while filmed in color tarantino has provided all the classic elements _„_ uma thurman portraying the femme fatale mia wallace and travolta willis and samuel jackson as mob members who consider their criminal actions morally justified within the context of their realm tarantino is able to take several major story lines and characters interweave them and tie everything together for the audience it is only at the end of the film do we understand all the scenes and stories presented the movie is even better watching a second time as one can better appreciate the nonlinear storylineprobably yes acting was good plot brilliant i mean stephen king wrote the book but it cant match the film. when i sow this movie i thought thats it this is it best movie ever. sure you can find people who didnt like it and when i ask why and try to guess what then happened they just confused themselves they can say reason why they dont like this movie... when i try to read comments with 1/10 star i cant find comment with good reasons that could make me realize that this movie is a bad movie if there is no reason then this means that its the best movie ever madethe only reason people are giving 1 star is that they dont like ratio 92 they want to do more effect by pull this high ratio down i really hate them : sorry for my bad english language i live in europe my english teacher is big cow with no knowledge...probably the most bizarre movie ive seentoo real i stayed focused the whole movie a movie different from the others if you have not seen  do not expect a movie convectional his actors are great great deal samuel l jackson travolta uma thurman bruce willis and others p d tarantino did not really like him but his irreverence breaking the mold in the way we produce is a genius strong real scenes some comedy i do not want to launch any spoiler only recommend as movie icon of the 90s i remember one afternoon i saw by chance among to her no plan to see it the result excellent screen somewhat opaque something retrograde very long so if not for minors disfruntelaprobably the best movie in the series the hobbit and lotr this movie is the best because of three crucial parts.first the stunning cgi only a genius like peter jackson could create along with weta workshop.the cgi will make you feel like the orcs are standing right in front of you.second up on the list is amazing writing.with dialog that makes it seem like real life instead of a moviewith most of the dialog coming from the books too.the finally thing that makes this movie great is the soundtrack.often put down as one of the best soundtracks everthe sad violin theme for rohan the iconic gondorian theme and even the mordor theme are good.and you cant deny it you probably cried towards the end of the movie.yes maybe the ending is a little over the top and gimli really isnt that cool and serves as comic relief but otherwise this movie is flawless.possibly the most important movie to be released in the 90s everything about this movie is perfect from the brilliant dialogue to the flawless editing right down to all the little details in virtually every single scene my all time favorite scene still has to be the adrenaline shot sequence at lances house the banter between the characters in that scene is so realistic and dead on that i almost forgot i was watching a movie quentin tarantino is one of the only directors next to paul thomas anderson who seems to have any kind of grasp on what can make movies the best art form ever createdpossibly the most entertaining movie ever kingsman the secret service is comprised of both oldfashioned flair and modern style each scene is methodically planned and executed ktss also contains some of the greatest action scenes in recent years the characters are likable the plot is mostly believable and the cinematography is beautiful with the perfect combination of plot acting action and humor kingsman is exciting throughout and receives without a doubt a 1010 kingsman the secret service is likely to entertain almost all who see it and i highly recommend it to allplot: andy dufresne tim robbins is a banker convicted of a murder he did not commit and sent to shawshank prison. after two months of being there he meets red morgan freeman a man who knows how to get things. the warden bob gunton uses andys banking skills for his scams and turns out to be more ruthless than he thought. andy spends twenty years in prison before his legendary escape. this is said to be the best film ever made. i can see why. it is defiantly my favourite film of all time. some say it is too over rated and that might be true but theres no doubt it is a fantastic and well executed film. the acting is good. morgan freeman is an excellent narrator. william sadler is also good. you cant help but laugh with haywood. the shawshank redemption is a brilliant story of hope friendship and obviously redemption. it also has a way of connecting with the viewers experiences. people relate their own life to the film and it helps people deal with bad moments it their lives. this is not a film to miss.plot the year is unknown but most likely close to present time the earth is running out of resources and a group of underground nasa workers seek the help of engineerastronaut turned farmer mr cooper in taking a journey across the galaxy and through a wormhole in hopes of a future for mankind on the other side that is the gist of the exposition of the plot its mostly quite clear what this movie is about through previews on paper this sounds like a typical scifi plot but chris nolan executes it like never before the movie seems to be getting more mixed reviews from critics compared to his other films and i think i have an explanation nolan and his team had too much faith in its audience the movie is full of science and dialogue strongly textured with physics theories the talk of wormholes and black holes are key to the movie but i know that many will be left confused even with the explanations of what is going on to make everything in the film scientifically possible after all physicist kip thorne was a consultant for the movie i found it quite educational interesting but also over done at times a good majority of people who watch this movie will be turned off by the abundance of scientific talk throughout the movie i personally loved it and was never lost but i could understand why many people were frustrated with the constant turns in the plot and overlong length i found this movie to be amazing sure at times the dialogue was hard to even understand there was a scene where a major character is dying and as he speaks his last words its almost impossible to decipher what is said it was also almost unintentionally humorous but that was a small price to pay and im sure the subtitles of the blu ray release will save that scene for me the directing and cinematography are gorgeously done the camera angles really bring the movie to life simple shots from the point of view of the rear of a truck or spaceship never looked so amazing the visuals were undeniably beautiful whether the setting was in space on the foreign planet or even the decaying earth the music of the film by hans zimmer deserves so much recognition i will even say it was better than the  for inception it really increased the tension and pushed for emotional heartache in many parts of the film there are many tense scenes that will have you holding on along with the characters in the movie and a good portion of this effect is due to the musical  the acting was top class matthew m gave one of the greatest human performances in history as mr cooper i seriously think it was better than his dallas buyers oscar winning performance i really hope he gets recognition for this there are more than a few scenes that will make even the most cold hearted person feel like crying he was just amazing anne hathaway gave a stunning emotional performance as the flawed bland jessica chastain has a few strong moments as well there is a scene regarding her character breaking down which will definitely make your eyes water the supporting cast all do justice to the movie too but matthew and jessica gave the best performances without a doubt in a way this movie resembles inception in certain areas inception had a hint of relativity in it with the time differences between the dreams the real world and limbo interstellar adds to that with the inclusion of a planet in the other galaxy in which every hour is equal to 7 years outside of its atmosphere in inception a central character is left behind and lost in the limbo world with its major difference of time in interstellar a central character is left behind in the other galaxy to find a new home while the other leaves to help the current home adjust until then in inception a central character is old for a moment in limbo at the end due to the difference in time relativity in interstellar the time relativity affects the entire human race as the astronauts are in the other galaxy in both movies the main character has left behind children and longs to be reunited inceptions main character doesnt want to see his childrens faces until they are truly reunited but in interstellar he holds on to the image of their faces as a survival tactic this movie is full of christopherjonathan nolanisms overall i think that this movie should be seen in theaters on the big screen if you have the chance it was a true experience be sure to be attentive and to clear your bladder first though it will make you think at times it might make you check your watch but please endure and you will be treated to one of the most intriguing films of all time even if you think you didnt like the film there is no doubt that you will be thinking about the contents of the plot and beauty of the visuals long after the credits rollpeter jacksons lord of the rings trilogy is likely to be the movie event of my lifetime. i may never see anything to equal its combined ambition scope and cinematic invention in my days on this earth. people who carp at and critizise little individual facets of the return of the king are surely missing the boat - its like looking at the statue of liberty and saying oooh see there i think theres a flaw on her elbow..... for heavens sake - these film-makers took on a vast multi-plotted fantasy that defied being told on a screen. the fact that they didnt turn out a stinker is credit enough - that they told the entire story coherently and well with every moment brimming with drama and visual imagination beggars belief. the project is the cinematic phenomenon of our time and anyone who doesnt see that whether or not the genre of which its a part floats their particular boat just isnt looking. having said all that the extended editions of these movies are for me the definitive versions so i await with huge anticipation the return of the king box-set where the sub-plots can be leisurely played out in all their glory. maybe ill post a full-scale review then.....peter jacksons lord of the rings trilogy comes to its epic conclusion in fine style: frodo and sam enter mordor while the battle of the pelennor fields begins largely as a feint to draw saurons army away to allow the ringbearer clear passage to mount doom. following the ring meeting its fate all story lines are brought to their resolutions in a half hour or so of winding down. jacksons visualisation of what happens inside mount doom is faithful to and improves upon tolkiens source - once again tolkien threw away one of his set pieces in less than a page. the one false note is gollums final expression - i would have expected agony rather than blimey thats a bit of a surprise there are at least five separate end-pieces - the fellowship reunited aragorns coronation the return to the shire the grey havens and sams return home it is possible to argue at least a couple more. the film could have been ended on any of these and there are those who argue that it should have been. but although the film could have ended there the story could not and credit to jackson for adding a half hour capstone to a ten hour film in order to properly resolve all that should have been resolved. i feel this particularly strongly since this closing section contains two of my favourite moments. one is the moment in the tavern - the four hobbits traumatised by war sit together in silence in stark contrast to the trivial carousing in the opposite bookend tavern scene in fellowship. and the other is frodos final look back. if elijah wood never delivers another moment on screen as powerful as that one and im sure he will that is enough. a towering achievement in all respects.peter jacksons epic adaptation of lord of the rings reaches its pinnacle in return of the king. the stellar cast mind-blowing special effects and heartbreaking script are all present in the third movie which is not only the last of the lord of the rings films but the best. frodo elijah wood and sam sean astin are still following the treacherous gollum andy serkis on the path to mordor with the increasingly strained frodo unaware that gollum is sowing suspicion between the two best friends. by the time he realises his mistake hes been dragged into the lair of shelob a monstrous spider and then abducted by orcs who want the ring he carries. determined to find his friend sam heads into an orc citadel... meanwhile gandalf ian mckellen takes pippin billy boyd with him to minas tirith after the hobbit has a close encounter with sauron through a palantir. \not only is the city under siege but the steward denethor is slowly going insane even sending his one remaining son faramir david wenham on a suicide mission to reclaim a dead city. with minas tirith crumbling aragorns viggo mortensen only hope may to be summon an army of the dead who will only obey the king of gondor. but even the dead wont help him if frodo doesnt destroy the ring... the lord of the rings trilogy is one of those once-in-a-lifetime movie experiences. there has never been anything quite like it in movie history and there probably never will be again. it seems somehow fitting that the book that every other fantasy has to measure up to has now become a sweeping cinematic triumph that actually stays halfway loyal to the books. good things come to fans who wait i guess. peter jackson really outdoes himself. you know those battle scenes in two towers and fellowship of the ring with the swooping camera and thousands of orcs clashing with men on a gloomy battlefield in return of the king jackson surpasses that. theres everything from volcanic eruptions to an invasion of howling ghosts to the attack of the oliphaunts like elephants only bigger. each action scene a shattering ride and theres no guarantee that all the beloved characters will make it out alive. some of them dont. but if jackson manages the epic battles well he does an even better job with the gentler quieter moments. the action slows down and the characters take a moment to support and comfort each other. they cry they hug they think about home -- such as gandalf comforting the frightened pippin with a description of the afterlife. jackson and his fellow screenwriters fran walsh and phillippa boyens throw themselves into the semi-formal language of tolkiens world resculpting tolkiens words into equally rich movie dialogue. elijah wood gives an unparallelled performance as frodo baggins. frodos gradual deterioration is wrenching to watch and the climactic scene at mount doom displays just what the ring can do to even the pure-hearted hobbit. sean astin follows up with his powerful performance as sam who is increasingly the strong hobbit rather than the follower. the final scenes between these two outstanding actors are beautiful and understated. but all the supporting cast also give powerful performances -- boyd and dominic monaghan put their characters through some intense growing pains and the im going to take care of you scene is enough to bring tears to your eyes. mortensen gets more kingly every moment while ian mckellen balances action with grandfatherly wisdom. bernard hill has a quietly moving final scene while miranda otto makes the despairing eowyn a strong kick-butt heroine. perhaps the most striking thing about return of the king is the final fourth of the film. while the multiple endings may annoy some viewers it seems somehow right to gently let go of these characters rather than have a sudden splashy finale. and whether they have a happy or sad ending jackson never lets us forget that they all made sacrifices to battle sauron. return of the king brings the epic lord of the rings trilogy to a close and cements jacksons reputation as a master filmmaker. with the outstanding cast beautiful scripting and amazing direction this is the best of the lord films -- and thats saying something.  and hes been my another most favourite actor ever since lord of the rings is one of most commercially successful movies of all time also the most oscar-winning movie in history together with titanic and ben-hur. thank you lord for this film... peter jacksons directing of the final installment to the trilogy is nothing short of a miracle. the battle of minas tirith was stunning the cg is highly realistic and the characters integrate very well into the scenes. the dialogue of the characters mostly correspond to tolkiens portrayal in the bookpeter jackson works magic for all of you who whined about the plot changes from the bookspeter jackson was right: this is the best movie of the series - and that is saying something because the two towers was superb. the correct genre for the lord of the rings series is horror/fantasy and never before has horror or fantasy been attempted on such a grand scale. the scenery is stunning the action sequences spectacular the horror superbly done. there is some humour a perfectly blended music  and of course computer imaging without peer. the character of gollum/smeagol is one of the great achievements in cinema history and the battle scenes pure genius. need i say more: this is one of the cinemas true masterpieces a stunning finale to a superb series.  this isnt a film that feels improvised in any way. on some very odd occasions this can result in some lines feeling a little forced but the pay-off is massive as the script is quite simply genius in many ways. this great writing has created some excellent iconic characters. it doesnt do any harm either that the acting is top level throughout. well with the exception of tarantinos cameo that is _„_ hes pretty terrible and should really never act. but otherwise its quality all the way with standout turns from samuel l. jackson john travolta bruce willis harvey keitel christopher walken and uma thurman. jackson probably steals the show with the character jules but travolta is very impressive and convincing as vincent vega _„_ you really believe he is a pretty nasty bit of work under the charm. thurman and willis play typical film-noir characters namely the femme fatale and the boxer who throws the fight _„_ both are excellent. while keitel and walken have cameo roles with the former as the very memorable mr wolf while the latter is in an extremely funny role as an ex-soldier who wore a watch up his butt. so whats it all about well the title says it all really because this is an unashamed bit of pulp fiction but a wonderfully original presentation of it. its influence is other movies such as italian poliziotteschi and american film noir with a huge post-modernist make-over. films specifically referenced include the italian connection a black and white gangster hit men are sent to sort a situation out and kiss me deadly a plot revolves around a suitcase that when opened has a mysterious glow. it is essentially a crime-comedy with a real focus on humour. this means that some of the strong violence is played simultaneously realistically but also for comic effect. while the staggered time-line is constructed for maximum impact. it is for example a pretty rare thing for a film to kill off a character vincent and then go back in time a little to watch his exploits in another escapade. we know he is doomed but cant help but completely forget this fact. its one of many reasons that this film stands out. one of the very best of the 90s and tarantinos masterpiece. peter jackson truly outdid himself with this instalment of the lord of the rings trilogy. this is the best of all three. better than the first two combined. the battle sequences and the action in this movie surpasses the action and battle sequences in the fellowship of the ring and the two towers. and you finally see why frodo baggins decided to go on the journey that he did and see gollums decent into madness from the one ring. after i saw this movie i was so overjoyed and it just blew me away and it kept my full attention all the way from beginning to end. i do not think any other fantasy movie can measure up to return of the king. the first two films almost measure up to this one. return of the king is a true masterpiecepeter jackson one director one trilogy amazing combination a director who made us live each and every moment of the lotr no one could have made it better. the whole cast and crew was lucky enough to be a part of such an amazing journey and delivered world class performance frodoelijah wood is just too good as an hobbit carrying the burden of the ring gandalf  ian mckellen is just unimaginably powerful aragorn  viggo mortensen  being the king of minas tirith is too awesome to resist the other character like legolas and gimli the old rivalry turned friendship is fun to watch. overall a movie made once and can never be made again and shall stay that way for long years to come in fact words fall short writing a review about such an epic fantasy adventure. i wish there was 11 to vote...peter jackson is absolutely amazing no matter what peter jackson is working on you can be sure to see excellent craftsmanship. lord of the rings seems to be a placed where everyone would like to visit. from the elvish language that everyone wanted to learn to speak. due to the eloquence when the actors spoke. right down to the amazing sets. he is able to take you into a world beyond your expectations. the actors did a wonderful job in bringing their characters to life. each actor was dedicated to portraying their characters. the costumes were wonderfully designed making one want to be apart of this magical world and who wouldnt want to live in the shire. i recommend seeing lord of the rings. you will not be disappointed. it was beyond the minds expectations.  this film isnt for everyone. but its a lot of fun to watch and this is because of tarrentionos cool ideas. so if your really into film youll probably like this. if youre female or liked titanic or both im thinkin you probably wont. peter jackson in his artistic is able to created the single greatest masterpiece of a movie that i have ever witnessed.everything about this movie staggered my imagination. the actors mckellen mortenson wood aston etc. are able to portray their respective characters that tolkein described to perfection. furthermore the directing sound costumes and effects all combined with each other to create an unprecedented masterpiece. only two movies shawshank redemption and forrest gump in my mind compete with the genius of the return of king. what separates lotr from other films though is its success in converting a fantasy into not only a mainstream smash but an eleven oscar-winning film. for these reasons i immensely enjoyed this truly unique epic.peter jackson has managed to make the audience feeling like in another time. from the first scene till the last one you are in the world of middle earth. i couldnÓ‰t imagine the characters to be played by others than elijah and co. this movie is a real breath taker.peter jackson did a marvelous job. this could be the year of the king come oscar night. i would not be surprised if it gets more than 10 nominations. although he left out some parts like the war in the shire by the hobbits and the ruffians it didnt deviate from the main focus of the story. best parts of the movie was the paths of the dead scene and the siege of gondor. aragorn was imposing to the ghosts. as for the siege of gondor what more can i say. the fight scene was made to perfection. i liked the way peter jackson at the start of the movie introduced how gollum came to be. it was in my opinion the one of the most critical elements of the entire series. if that would not had been shown the story would be incomplete. even though the movie started in the middle of the two towers book it didnt affect much. the acting was superb. the stunts especially that of legolas killing an oliphant were amazing. i think jackson made the best decision when he cast elijah wood to be frodo baggins and sir ian mckellen as gandalf. i would not be surprised if wood gets a nod for a nomination for best actor and mckellen a 2nd crack for best supporting actor. in general king deserves to be nominated for an oscar. and if it wins the best picture lets all start chanting hail to the kingpeter jackson delves deep into the works of tolkien to bring to life the emotions of the denizens of middle earth. the three hours and eleven minutes of the movie leaves the watcher gasping hoping yearning at the end you dont want it to end and you are left with a sence of serenity and peace. it is a must see movie for all who love tolkien and the lord of the rings series.personally i was and i am ashamed to say this quite late to join the huge number of film fans that would hold the shawshank redemption within their top 5 films of all time - if not number 1. if youre wondering mine is the princess bride childhood favourite but thats beside the point. i think the first time i watched it was in 2006 and i instantly fell in love with it. i now watch the film at least 5/6 times a year without fail and i am hardly ever far from tears of joy by the end. if you use the old analogy of if an alien came to earth show them how... to make a film you would show them this as the blueprint. just brilliant.perfection has to be the best word to describe this terrific movie. it has everything you could ever want including a great story characters direction editing sound music effects acting funny lines settings. i could go on forever with praise talking about how outstanding this movie is and how emotional it was. it has to be the greatest movie ever made. fotr and ttt were both terrific as well but this one has to be the best of all three by far. once i walked out that cinema theatre i was just blown away and knew it was and if you havent seen it yet then let me tell you now. this movie will take your breath away. enjoy now and for many milleniums to come outstanding 1000000000000/10people will have interesting reactions to this film all of matthew vaughns movies have been good and he was able to push it further with this one i would call it an action comedy but there is more of an emphasis on the action than the genre usually has there are cool pov shots and it gets you right into the thick of it it mixes it up with some short moments where it doesnt cut so quickly as well as a few long takes that are particular nice the violence and comedy has a guttural component which a person like me really enjoys but it will throw some off the film is a throwback to old spy flicks while at the same time being a sort of parody it is humorous throughout samuel l jackson plays an odd megalomaniac who makes you laugh more than shiver which goes with the tone of the movie it is nice to see samuel l in the role of a bad guy i have no doubt that many will enjoy the henchwoman who has a different element to her colin firth fits in with the particularly suave spying and the newcomer playing the protagonist taron egerton handles both the action and comedy well mark strong is always a good actor for movies with dark humor it is fun however those who are sensitive may have trouble enjoying it it is not a film for everyone but that makes it better for others i personally think it is vaughns best work 875overall i am disappointed though not surprised by the negative criticism of this movie. indeed this criticism exceeds the offering of alternative viewpoints and the expression of other cinematic possibilities and sinks into the realm of bitter invective. so many armchair critics are currently competing with avid tolkien jackson and movie fans alike in order to espouse the true value of peter jacksons landmark movie trilogy. for it is a landmark event in cinema history based on its sheer size and careful attention praise and evisceration apart. the issue that greatly irritates me and pushes me to write is that many of the negative reviewers on this website have such limited room in their imagination that they cannot conceive of a world outside their own narrow framework. i find that a most sad reality in light of the legacy of tolkien jackson and all good story-tellers -- to create to engender and to nourish the growth of any and all imaginative ventures. the problem with imagination is that it is an individual event a unique subjective experience that a single person experiences completely alone. those who enter into the realm of art fiction fantasy and any degree of story-telling agree willingly or no to take that personal act of creation and primal nature and share it with the community of human beings each of whom has his or her own imaginative context. it is a bold act of sacrifice self-confidence and faith spiritual one could argue to thrust the contents of ones subjective reality into to borrow from douglas adams the whole sort of general mish mash. people who do so deserve respect for the mere creative act the ability to foist forward what they believe is true. from homer to bill oreilly this concept of personal creation what tolkien called sub-creation is the essence of modern human existence and we owe it to each other to respect the right to creation history has granted us. therefore in defense of both tolkien whom some on this website have maligned and jackson whom many have maligned i forward that both are imaginative creators in their own right with different and completely acceptable offerings to the world. those who cannot tolerate either for mediocre writing or atrocious film-making should offer forth their literary or cinematic offspring instead of cunningly-worded diatribes of their deep dissatisfaction with all that does not conform to their inner reality. then we few who believe in and trust the creative ability of all will be able to see how those critical inner realities so authoritative in exposition match up with the rest of our perceptions. tolkien was an enormously talented intelligent and imaginative man one whose stories though unpolished by experience still managed to attract a worldwide audience and devoted following with their luster. jacksons movies took the sheen and inherent value of tolkiens stories and placed it in a visual medium a place where fans of lotr could witness and love the events and people they held so dear. of course tolkiens story is imperfectover the summer i had seen the advertisements and commercials for the movie guardians of the galaxy when i first saw the commercial all i could think was this looks silly and then i saw the fact it was part of the marvel series and i was torn whether or not to go watch it while it was still in theaters it did not look good but maybe it would play a big role in the marvel movie series but i did end of going to see it for the heck of it and absolutely loved it overall the movie was humorous very entertaining and in my opinion a great addition to the marvel series and even gained a rating of 92% on the movie critic website rotten tomatoes throughout the movie the thing that stood out the most was the humor part of the movie there were parts of the movie i just could not stop laughing because it was so silly and just so amusing to watch and enjoyable i mean the way you know it is a humorous movie is when you come out of the theater repeating lines and talking about parts of the movie and still just laughing as much as you did when you saw the movie and this is a movie that passes that test another killer part of the movie that made it so good was the soundtrack that went through the movie the biggest role the soundtrack has to a movie is to provide the noise for times where there is not dialog and just brings a smile to your face in the movie the main leader of the guardian of the galaxies starlord he plays a tape his mother gave him that brings back the classic musical hits that you just cannot help but sing along to and just smile while remembering the good old days overall the acting was pretty superb and each actor brought their own flare and became the character very well even just in the voice overs for characters such as rocket and groot apart of the movie that i really enjoyed was the way each actor had their chance to make their character shine and make them seem important and walking away you realize that each character had importance to the group and the actors all came together to form a pretty solid team called the guardians of the galaxies probably the most controversial aspect of the movie is the whole marvel aspect marvel over the years has made a killing in suckering viewers to come see their latest hits and leave us at the end wanting another marvel movie to come to theaters to continue the story i know many people saw the commercials thought the same thing i did who on earth are the guardians of the galaxies? most people know who spiderman ironman or even the incredible hulk are but unless you read the comic books you would most likely have no clue who the guardians of the galaxies are throughout the movie though i believe the writer did a good job in tying in the marvel universe and made a point by using characters most people would have no idea how they were connected to the story line that viewers have come to know through all other marvel movies and the big hitter that brings them all together the avengers going off the mpaa rating of the movie pg13 seems somewhat appropriate due to little bit of foul language and a couple of references to alcohol and gambling however i do think the movie can still be considered a family because it does bring a humorous aspect and nothing to raunchy is presented and besides what kid does not love a talking raccoon or even a tree that can only say i am groot overall i really enjoyed this movie and would definitely watch it over again marvel has done a very good job in adding a new addition to the movie series through the all the humor the acting the action the soundtrack and in the end i walked away from the movie hoping to see more of the guardians of the galaxies in future marvel moviesover 12 years of the making of goodness through the scenes of them moving and camping and school and very intimidating life if you happen to pass by a theater playing it go and watch it 165 minutes of inspiration of the life of a young man mason from age 5 to age 18 as there father and mother are separated and lives with hes sister and mother and sees hes father each year as the mother keeps on marrying men then they become a threat to them they move across the united states to find a nice place but as mason is growing and finds a job and grow up in to college the mother doesnt find much luck  the movie of a lifetime   cameron ruseoutstanding image and sound atmosphere well performed by the lead actors the subject is very carefully constructed it keeps you interested all the time surreal landscapes for scifi lovers i noticed a new technique that attracted my attention loud sounds followed by total sudden silence with exceptional imaging to make you focus on watching the screen undisturbed by other stimuli this way you wont loose the detail that the director wanted you to capture very original for the visual and audio part interstelar is pure art of the scifi genre a priceless gem in an ocean of cinematic junk that overflows in the present very original plot carefully presented and leaving quite a space to interpretation and to meditate upon it as a scifi fan i highly recommend watching this film it will leave you very impressed and satisfiedoutrageously violent time-twisting and in love with language pulp fiction was widely considered the most influential american movie of the 1990s director and co-screenwriter quentin tarantino synthesized such seemingly disparate traditions as the syncopated language of david mamet  the serious violence of american gangster movies crime movies and films noise mixed up with the wacky violence of cartoons video games and japanese animation  and the fragmented story-telling structures of such experimental classics as citizen kane rashomon and la joete the oscar-winning script by tarantino and roger avary intertwines three stories featuring samuel l jackson and john travolta in the role that single-handedly reignited his career as hit men who have philosophical interchanges on such topics as the french names for american fast food products  bruce willis as a boxer out of a 1940s b-movie  and such other stalwarts as harvey keitel tim roth christopher walken eric stoltz ving rhames and uma thurman whose dance sequence with travolta proved an instant classic out of pulp true fleshy meaty stories form. set in the criminal underworld of 90s los angeles pulp fiction revolves around the disparate yet interconnected cast. quentin tarantinos par excellence pulp fiction toys with our hearts our humour popular culture and even the conventions of narrative cinema itself. the movie has been a firm favourite of mine for a long time. the movie has a stellar to cast to bolster the glare of the mighty storyline with a killer soundtrack to match. it is gritty powerful funny insightful dark and precious with some jaw dropping moments and heart stopping dialogue. as definitive a 90s movie as is ever as likely to get and stylistic to tarantino himself who has managed to carve his own dialect into the language of hollywood.only once every few years does a movie of this caliber get released the last movie of recent days that impressed me as much as this film did was the lord of the rings trilogy so this film is now sitting in my opinion with the biggest films of all time. the acting in this film is mostly superb i say mostly cause the performance of maggie gyllenhaal leaves a little bit to be desired and the voice that christian bale puts on when he becomes the dark knight is a little over the top plus some very average performances from many minor characters but aaron eckhart michael caine gary oldman and morgan freeman are all excellent and so is christian bale for the most part when you look past the over done voice. for obvious reasons i left one name out of the list and its the name everyone has been talking about since this movie was released the sadly departed heath ledger. heaths performance as the joker is beyond excellent it puts him up with the greatest actors of all time including marlon brando and johnny depp. he undoubtedly becomes the joker and throughout the film you never really see heath ledger you are looking at batmans most famous villain not a man playing him. i did have doubts when i first heard they were casting heath as the joker but obviously my doubts have been put to bed. now what makes this film great is not just the acting its the storyline the directing by christopher nolan and the all round production values are just superb and surpasses the excellent batman begins by a few miles. the only thing i will say against the storyline is that harvey dents phase as two-face is way too short lived they killed him off after about 45 minutes of the character being in the film which disappointed me a little cause two-face is an excellent villain. all in all a brilliant film that deserves all the hype and praise it gets and more with only a few very niggling problems that dont effect the overall  of this film one bit.one word to sum it all up. amazing. the dark knight has been my favorite movie since i had seen it in the theateras part of a dark knight/ x-files: i want to believe double feature. and remains thus. everything about the dark knight stands out not only amongst other comic book movies but movies in general. the tone was one of insanity and chaos perfectly match by the on-screen antics of none other than the joker batmans greatest foe. thus we segue into the major article of discussion for this movie the brilliant heath ledger. taken from us too soon heath ledger not only made this character his own but he also took the time to learn and understand it. he knew the joker inside and out playing the role perfectly in every way. with no regard for his own life or anyone elses the joker embarks on a quest of sorts to tear gotham apart by attempting to turn its greatest citizens into twisted versions of the heroes they once were while batman tries to stay true to his values with the help of the always supportive alfred pennyworth expertly performed by michael kaine gothams brave new daone of the movies worth to watch always again and again....the movie entertains you from the very start to the very end.no matter how many times you watch the movie you would not feel bored at all. it is one of those kind of movies which makes a place in your mind as one of the best movies watched and worth to be watched again and again.a movie which is at a level which is very high.indeed the christopher nolan trio-logy makes the batman comic character look very good. christian bale is one the the best hollywood actor i have ever seen.. his acting as batman and bruce wayne is too good.heath ledger on the other hand definitely played the joker character too goodhe really scares the audience by his acting. this is one of the best movie made by christopher nolan and definitely for more movies from christopher nolan and jonathan nolan.one of the greatest movies ever made. shawshank tells the story of andy dufresne a banker convicted of his wives and her lovers murder. when andy comes across inmate red the two form a near two decade long relationship. with tim robbins and morgen freeman in lead roles shawshank is an absolute masterpiece that every film lover should watch. frank darabonts directing is great and even more so than any of his previous work. theres really not much wrong with shawshank. the adaptation from stephen kings epic novel is compelling exciting disheartening and inspiring. with great supporting characters an incredible plot and stunning directing shawshank has become one of the greatest movies ever made. its an absolute travesty that this didnt win the oscar for best picture in 1994 although there was some stiff competition.one of the greatest movie ever made. the storyline the acting and of course the ending - all perfect.. definitely the strongest of the movies in the trilogy. the movie itself is breath-taking exciting incredibly emotional and tough in so many different levels. i get the same stunning feeling every time i watch it. christian bale & heath ledger really managed to pull it off #the scene when batman has to choose between saving rachel or harvey dent.. damn and how the joker manages to break even one of the very best. and then twists him leaving him suffering as a changed man making some really bad decisions. not to mention all the chaos he made in gotham.. until batman shows up attempting to clean up all the madness. i am still not 100% sure if joker actually won at the end or batman kinda succeed.. anyways this is a movie that will be watched in many many centuries. r.i.p heath ledgerone of the finest films made in recent years. its a poignant story about hope. hope gets me. thats what makes a film like this more than a movie. it tells a lesson about life. those are the films people talk about 50 or even 100 years from you. its also a story for freedom. freedom from isolation from rule from bigotry and hate. freeman and robbins are majestic in their performances. each learns from the other. their relationship is strong and you feel that from the first moment they make contact with one another. there is also a wonderful performance from legend james whitmore as brooks. he shines when it is his time to go back into the world only to find that the world grew up so fast he never even got a chance to blink. stephen kings story is brought to the screen with great elegance and excitement. it is an extraordinary motion that people will be talking about in 50 or 100 years.one of the films that you must watch in lifetime. a film about long-term imprisonment that takes its time to convey what the slow crawl of a lifers existence might feel like. thoroughly gripping and pretty refreshing. ten years ago the shawshank redemption was a low-key prison film that didnt recoup its costs. slowly it has become one of the most popular movies of all time - and for some it has even been life- changing. it is a strange comment to make about a film set inside a prison but the shawshank redemption creates a warm hold on our feelings because it makes us a member of a family. many movies offer us vicarious experiences and quick superficial emotions. shawshank slows down and looks. it uses the narrators calm observant voice to include us in the story of men who have formed a community behind bars. it is deeper than most filmsone of the classic movie ever made. lots of enthusiasm is shown in the movie apart from all the suffering prisoners have to face. must watch movie. still capturing the box office. shawshank is a true story and a must watch for any new member. tim robbins has done a fantastic job including morgan freeman. the story line of the movie is really more biased then any other top bench marking movie. stephen kings story is brought to the screen with great elegance and excitement. it is an extraordinary motion that people will be talking about in 50 or 100 years.no action no special effects - just men in prison uniforms talking to each other. the shawshank redemption and to kill a mockingbird are the best movies i have ever seen. i do not judge it by its technical merits - i dont really care about that. i have read that citizen kane or the godfather or this or that movie is the best movie ever made. they may have the best technique or be the most influential motion pictures ever made but not the best. the best movies are ones that touch the soul. it takes a movie like the shawshank redemption to touch the soul.one of the best stories on film. acting cinematography... its all in there. a must see. a piece of our history as filmmakers. this story is compelling as you feel for each characters deep struggles within a community of inmates. a range of characters excite the plot with its unexpected culture as an intimate story unfolds of secrets shame struggle and finally triumph. morgan freeman deserves an oscar for his amazing performance and tim robbins executes his character flawlessly as andy dufresne a man of clever who navigates his way through a sharp turn to a new way of life. this story isnt missing a morsel and keeps you on the edge of your seat with mystery murder and the element of surprise. the shawshank redemption shares the ranks of the best feature screenplay i have ever read. it read unlike any other and was the kind you cant put down. saving private ryan comes in at a close second. frank darabont is a hell of a writer and is also credited with the green mile and developed the walking dead series.one of the best new movies to have come around in a long while its definitely my favorite angelina movie by far she was exceptional in her role she made me love maleficent before maleficent was just some character in an old disney princess movie that really made me feel nothing for her at all this film brings maleficent to wonderful life she is honestly now one of my most favorite characters of all time this is definitely not like any disney princess movie if thats what you may be thinking its dark and beautiful and if it wasnt blatant about being disney you might not even know this film is definitely worth a watch it has taken a place on my favorite movies list for sureone of the best movies that i have ever seen.it truly transcends time and is an epic in all proportions.people just dont make movies like this anymore and this is one of my favorite movies of all time. the movie is about andy dufranea banker who has been wrongfully acquitted of killing his wife in cold blood and send to shaw shank prison.the movie shows the various hardships faced by andy and how he does not give up hope and carries on with patience and finally becomes free. the climax is absolutely spellbinding and will leave you aghast.it is a truly great movie and i was aghast at finding out that this movie was a failure in the box office.but now almost everyone recognizes this movie for what it truly is - a masterpiece of storytelling.one of the best movies ive ever seenit is the best work of tarantino. interlocking different stories into one with black humor action and thriller are some greatest qualities of this awesome movie. its an anthology that blends three stories and 12 principal characters into a mesmerizing mosaic of the los angeles scuzz world. the acting is dynamite: john travoltasamuel jackson bruce willis gave very good performance.even tarantinos role was quite good. pulp fiction is ferocious fun without a trace of cautioncomplacency or political correctness to inhibit its 153 deliciously lurid minutes.you will find humoractionthrillersuspense and new sense of continuum in this movie.one of the best movie series i have seen in a while. this one is though by far my favorite. not just the ending but the final battle as well. through all the movies you see the struggles that each character especially frodo goes through. and to see in the end such a remarkable battle followed by frodo and bilbo leaving together on the boatone of the best movie i have watched ever not once stopped my breath when i watching all 3 parts for the first time. i could not wait to get herring and the next.. i like it because it has used imaginative and beautiful places. i really like movies made _„æ_„æby words. especially when it comes to humanity and its survival the beauty of nature is very well shown and the evil forces of darkness. moments in which people come together and trust each other are ostentation of goodness soon i have not seen a film like this and i think that it is not made _„æ_„æyet why ima very good producers and i am sure that soon something will come very impressive as the lord of the ringsone of the best from comics. dark knight dont even find words to explain the beauty of movie... just excellent. the dark knight is a 2008 superhero crime thriller film directed and co-written by christopher nolan. based on the dc comics character batman the film is part of nolans batman film series and a sequel to 2005s batman begins. christian bale reprises the lead role. the film follows bruce wayne/batman bale district attorney harvey dent/two-face aaron eckhart assistant d.a. rachel dawes maggie gyllenhaal and police commissioner james gordon gary oldman and their struggles and journey in combating the new rising threat of a criminal who goes by the name of the joker heath ledger. nolans inspiration for the film was the jokers comic book debut in 1940 and the 1996 series the long halloween which retold two-faces origin. the dark knight was filmed primarily in chicago as well as in several other locations in the united states the united kingdom and hong kong. nolan used an imax camera to film some sequences including the jokers first appearance in the film. on january 22 2008 after he had completed filming the dark knight heath ledger died from a toxic combination of prescription drugs leading to intense attention from the press and movie-going public. warner bros. had initially created a viral marketing campaign for the dark knight developing promotional websites and trailers highlighting screen shots of ledger as the joker but after ledgers death the studio refocused its promotional campaign.one of the best and must watch movie which i ever enjoyed....shawshank encompasses friendships hardships hopes and dreams. and what is so great about the movie is that it moves you it gives you hope. even though the circumstances between the characters and the viewers are quite different you dont feel that far removed from what the characters are going through. it is a simple film yet it has an everlasting message. frank darabont didnt need to put any kind of outlandish special effects to get us to love this film the narration and the acting does that for him. why this movie didnt win all seven oscars is beyond me but dont let that sway you to not see this film let its ranking on the imdbs top 250 list sway you let your friends recommendation about the movie sway you. set aside a little over two hours tonight and rent this movie. you will finally understand what everyone is talking about and you will understand why this is my all time favorite movie.one of the aspects of the movie that is very interesting growing up in a broken family mason lives constant stressful interactions with his parents and stepfathers many times adults are in their own world and they have little empathy he doesnt like it he has to cope on the other hand he has very nice moments with his father who tries hard to be the best parent he can be the mother tries too but it is a different story also we see some nice family gatherings beautiful movie that makes the audience experience the process of growing up richard linklater took twelve years to shoot this film this is breakthrough something that has never done beforetruly a master pieceone of my favorite movies everthe shawshank redemption is a modern day classic as it tells the story of two inmates who become friends and find solace over the years in which this movie takes place.based on a stephen king novelthis movie makes us feel different watching this film than most others as this is an incredibly realistic film.tim robbins stars as andy dufresne who is convicted of murder and morgan freeman as ellis boyd red redding who is a fellow inmate and close friend of dufresne and bob gunton as warden samuel norton who is the warden of shawshank state prison and is a character who has mixed feelings and emotions towards everyone around him and a character who is sometimes easy to like and at other times easy to despise.this film is easily considered one of the greatest films of all time and i definitely agree with this fact.it was nominated for seven academy awards including best picture best actor _„_ morgan freeman best adapted screenplay best cinematography best editing best original  and best sound but didnt win any due to tough competition from the film forrest gump.i personally think that tim robbins should have been nominated for the best actor award as he really gave the performance of his career.bravo to this brilliant modern day classicone of my all time favorites. shawshank redemption is a very moving story about hope and the power of friendship. the cast is first rate with everyone giving a great performance. tim robbins and morgan freeman carry the movie but bob gunton and clancy brown are perfect as the warden norton and prison guard captain hadley respectively. and james whitmores portrail of an elderly inmate brooks is moving. the screenplay gives almost every actor at least one or more memorable lines through out the film. as well as a very surprising twist near the end that almost knocked me out of my chair. if you have not seen this movie rent it or better yet buy it. as i bet youll want to see this one more than once.one of most hyped movies ever and it lived up to all expectations the best super hero movie you will ever see. christopher nolan is known for his big blockbusters. the dark knight is his masterpiece. christian bale plays the dark tortured batman that gothom and viewers deserve. his supporting cast is magnificent as well. michael caine aaron eckhart maggie gyllenhaal gary oldman and morgan freeman seemed to be made for their respective roles. all of them pitched in perfectly to the storyline to enhance everyone experience eckart was the perfect face of gothom in harvey dent. his story is well developed on top of the obvious batman storyline. eckhart transformed into the most riveting two face the batman movies have encountered. the best acting in the movie is by far heath ledger as the joker. never before has the joker been seen as this dark unpredictable and ruthless. ledger puts on a performance of a lifetime his performance alone is a reason to see this film. the storyline was much better developed than other batman movies as well. nolan did a fantastic job with taking the original storyline and developing it into a plot that can contain so many elements and characters. when you put all of these aspects together on top of the entertaining action effects and batman gadgets that everyone expects you get a masterpiece.one of best movies in the world history and absolutely my another most favourite movie of all time the unforgettable movie based on a trilogy novel about which most people agree that its as satisfying as the novel. peter jackson has successfully made this middle earth history become real i also give a credit to j.r.r. tolkien for his wonderful novel lord of the rings and the hobbits he has amazingly created a story that feels like a real part of the world history what an outstanding imagination all actors and actresses have wonderfully given their best in this perfect until every detail epic movie we really feel their chemistry one to another. this is also a movie that worthy and enjoyable to watch again and again from which we still get something new even when we watch it for 12th times either a new value or a scene we might have no longer remembered. one of best parts of the trilogy i fell in love with elijah wood after watching its final one the return of the kingone couldnt help be sceptical of the hype surrounding the dark knight before having seen it scepticism was certainly weighing on my mind as i walked into the cinema. i couldnt help thinking is this going to be as amazing as expected or is the hype just an inevitable reaction to the death of heath ledger i can safely say to anyone still having not seen the dark knightone action scene after another and action is putting it lightly.you will sit on the front of your seat the entire movie. when you think you can sit back for a breather bam another action scene even bigger than the one before it. after this movie is over is the only time you will be able to sit back and relax. the faint of heart should not watch this one. nolan has made an enormously profitable smash with the batman franchise but at the risk of sounding priggish i cant help thinking it may be a bit of a career blind-alley for the talented director who gave us brilliant and disquieting movies like following 1998 and memento 2000 whose inventions still linger in the mind. the dark knights massive box-office success has surely given nolan the means to write his own cheque and in addition something sweeter still - clout. i hope that he will use it to cultivate movies that are smaller and more manoeuvrable than that great armoured batmobile.one - word tarantino   in far 1994 as you know there was a decent number of very interesting and qualitative movies such as: escape from shawshank frank darabont leon luc besson forest gump of robert zemekis  transfer of all these pictures can borrow much it is a lot of lines but it is most from listed above in my opinion quentin tarantinos movie _„î pulp fiction in due time this picture made furor both on critics and on film fans the movie received the oscar for the best scenario was nominated for sets of awards and in general is recognized as one of the best criminal tapes when or removed why _„î it received this rank in my opinion it occurred from _„î for courageous approach to violence impudent talks and the extraordinary scenario written by the director tarantino managed to make simply cult movie which it is possible to reconsider one hundred times of a weak and simple plot to tarantino anybody such didnt do anything and infinite imitations from which i can distinguish cards went then the money two trunks guy ricci and barry zonenfelda though even they near reading matter are destroyed about actors conversations are absolutely excessive after all everything likely is already told to me john travolta sam jackson uma thurman bruce willis tim roth harvey keitel christopher walken and great and awful quentin tarantino _„î everything coped with the roles unbelievable my result pulp fiction _„î the movie simply phenomenal before it cheerful interesting and extraordinary above any estimatesonce again peter jackson proofed that hes one of the best visionary directors of his time. the lord of the rings: the return of the king is yet another masterpiece. frodo and sam tight their bonds so they can together cast the one ring into the mountain of doom. with a lot of pathos action and emotional scenes the lord of the rings: the return of the king combines every feature that movie should have. excellent music from howard shore only suits this movie up - great brasses violins and other string sections will make you cry even after tenth showing. its long. in extended edition it has over 4 hours of watching but believe me you wont even blink an eye. peter jackson doesnt make a mistake like other directors that are basing on books. some moments are mixed like pj wanted but the movie grip strong to the book. in my last words i want to say that the lord of the rings: the return of the king is a must-see position on your watchlist. its an incredible masterpiece that take my breath after almost ten years of watching.on lord of the rings in general: this is how film making should be done this beautifully woven piece of cinema deserves all the praise and attention it gets it is truly a labour of love and care the tremendous amount of effort put into these films makes it a must see for anyone wanting to see how a big budget fantasy blockbuster should be made theres nothing bad about this film and if there is then people would be looking for things that are bad and thats just knit picking. everything from the writing casting acting production design art cinematography lighting music sound everything is spot on with this these films. on this film in particular: the best of the three thats right this is the first time i have watched a trilogy/ sequel and can put my hand on my heart and say that these films get better as they go along mainly because it reaches the ultimate climax it possibly can without losing any momentum and steam from the first films and has the best pay off you could ask for changes have been made from the books of course but every change jackson has made from tolkiens novels is completely justified for its use in a cinematic context i honestly cried at the end of this film and thats not an easy task for me to get me as invested in this world and its characters as jacksons trilogy has well lets just say it takes a lot only pixar has achieved the same with me and ill be lucky if any other film is capable of making me do so again. what is there more to say a beautifully made film with a wonderfully dramatic climax you really do get the feeling of being on a journey with these films you feel enticed with the characters as they embark on it and for a 3 hour film to do so without losing any momentum as with all three of them well thats an achievement in itself. it honestly deserved every award it got and then some.on every level acting photography sound costumes direction and plot you are absorbed into the story. it is as fresh today as the day i saw it in the cinema and has yet to be bettered in its genre. you as the audience believe that the actors arent merely reciting the dialogue but have become each character they represent. peter jackson could so have easily followed the blockbuster formula to conclude the film with an epic battle but we are respected as fellow members of the story/crew and given the entirety of the story. though it completes the story i was very unhappy it had to end as you want to know what happens next over all the leading characters lifetimes. this is a totally outstanding epic which will be enjoyed for decades to come.on a winters weekend when i was six my family and i having not seen a lotr film before watched the trilogy. and yes it deserves a capital. then i watched it for the battles the epic battles. now i watch it for the story nostalgia and of course the battles. i have watched each of the trilogy many many times. ive watched them in the car on an old portable dvd player that only lasted two hours and ive watched them on each of the three tvs my family has owned in the last nine years. ive grown up with the films and the games of the films the top trumps and the knock-offs of the films. nothing can replicate the plot or the spectacle i know but something to remind me of them is enough. and i am therefore finally reading the books yes im looking forward to the hobbit trilogy note no capital not yet at least. but i am always looking back at lotr.okay this title is the key for tarantino in the movies. the storyline is perfect the conclusion may be sad but in fact its the life indeed. the action in the movie have strong scenes showing the life of a bounty hunter in the new ages. the movies can be difficult to people who do not like a detailed story showing the every details of all action/dialogs etc. if youre not a fan of the cult films may be this title is not for you. but if you are a big fan of the cult films just like me well this movie was made _„æ_„æfor you to watch this you must know some rules the end is the begging and vice versa. and what do i mean well in the tarantinos style of making films he dont start with the begin of the plotok. so 4 hrs after all the adds and the previews... without a bathroom break break was really long. and yes it was hot and crowded. yes the lineup was an hour and 30 mins long and yes my butt was really really sore. it was all worth it. what was started 3 years ago is over. finally no. im going to miss the excitement of seeing what comes next even through i already knew the bottom line is that this was a great finale to one of the greatest epics of our time. go out. see it with your kids. introduce them to movie making the way it should always be. enjoy. 10/10ok after a very long waiting for the bluray today i watched the movie first of all ill guarantee you that this is a must watch movie for scifi lovers the runtime is long and someone can think this is boring but i must tell you that watch this movie till the end actually i can say that its a journey that you feel to the core all the credits must go for the plot and the best director like all of them said the plot is completely pure also must say that hans zimmer done a fantastic job all over the movie and with a pure plot and nolans directing + hans zimmers music its a high class weapon that can attack you heavily christopher nolan this movie showed us what you can do and its very clear that you made your life immortaloften said to be one of the best films of all time i cant help but agree. no matter how many times i watch this over i feel like it never bores me and i am always captivated in a way that ive never felt with any other film before. the shawshank redemption is a tale of hope courage and betrayal seen through the eyes of prison inmates andy played by tim robbins and older convict red portrayed by morgan freeman in an oscar nominated performance. the film is set over 19 years in shawshank prison and depicts the life of andy dufresne a hotshot banker and his struggle with keeping his mind and his sanity whilst serving time for a crime he didnt commit. as andy has to put up with harassment distress and affliction throughout the duration of his time at the prison the film illustrates a tale of eternal hope. as time slowly passes in the prison hes assisted by an older inmate by the name of red redding morgan freeman a black marketer who is known to locate certain things from time to time. as the years pass by andys friendship with red grows and so do the hardships they have to overcome. the film itself has touched me in many ways it shows me just what people can do when they have a little faith and keep incessant hope no matter what. obviously stephen kings greatest and most memorable big screen interpretation one of which he is almost certainly proud of. the movie is a timeless classic that speaks to me and probably a lot of others on so many levels providing a near perfect film with a great plot line and representing a storyline with an even better message. tim robbins delivers an enthralling performance as the titular character one that certainly stands out throughout the film whereas morgan freemans interpretation of fellow convict red is just as captivating earning him recognition from the academy but not his fellow co-star robbins obviously yet another oscar snub. overall the shawshank redemption speaks out to its audience as it shows a tale of perseverance and perpetual hope when in the midst of the struggles in life. the film itself is possibly my favourite of all time and manages to keep my attention on the 10th time of watching it. a must-see for anyone who has a good taste in films and is looking for a movie that will change their perspective on life and give them the hope to pull through in the darkest of times.of all the movies i must say that this had the best visual effects. this was my most beloved book and to see it come to life on screen was absolutely amazing. peter jackson once again worked his magic. the characters are still as amazing as ever. legolas has incredible stunts that make you want to stand up and cheer. eowyn becomes a hero. merry and pippin arent up to there usual mischief. gandalf is as awesome as ever. aragorn is a very important role in the film. gimli still brings some comic relief into the film. and arwen is still as fair as ever. this film is a must see by all lovers of tolkien although you must expect to see a few scenes missing the houses of healing the scouring of the shire and a couple others. it goes without saying that peter jackson brought home the gold with this one...literally. he won best director at the golden globes and the film won best dramatic film at the golden globes. now they need to bring home the little bald guy oscars on february 29 2004. film rating: 10/10Óä - i love you pumpkin - i love you too honey bunny Ó_ pulp fiction is a cult and timeless film because based on a director with a unique treatment of cinema quentin tarantino has a real talent for turning the violence in derision so that even the dramatic moments are hilarious actors including john travolta uma thurman samuel l jackson and bruce willis play wonderfully and its soundtrack is really great the fact that the film focuses on the stories of several characters intersect at one time or another is interesting and original moreover the dialogues are memorable and the story is very fascinating besides we can almost say that all scenes are cult scene cheeseburger the dance scene the scene of the cellar finally i would say it is essential for any movie buff : a head of workoccasionally you go into a cinema and all the films you wanted to see were full. as youve come this far and youre a bit of a film fan you go to see a film youve heard nothing about. i did this 6 years ago with expectations low and a boredom threshold to match i sat and waited to be disappointed. 2 hours later i walked out of the cinema a different person before i had not been moved by a film i didnt care if : indiana jones made it sonny corleone got wacked fred married ginger et got home. before films were either plot driven or character driven they were action or comedy sad or happy a few came along that combined a number of facets that i enjoyed respected or challenged how i viewed an issue or a person. shawshank was different there were characters i believed not just one or two but virtually all. throughout the first hour i was gripped the full range of emotions were explored the second hour building on the characters was even more powerful some characters came and went but ultimately this was a story of 2 people: red and andy. i have never seen a film that so eloquently and beautifully illustrates friendship and hope. this has become the benchmark by which i judge all movies. i am pleased that i am not alone in feeling this way. i am glad that it did not win oscars as i feel individual endorsement is stronger than any vested interest award ceremony i relish telling everyone this is my favourite film. i have seen it many times and will see it many more.now im aware the lord of the rings is three movies but in my eyes it is one giant movie and story. they next one also picks up right where the other left off. here we go the review of peter jacksons epic trilogy the lord of the rings. lord of the rings is a trilogy of books written a long time ago by j.r.r. tolkien and it is the most clichÍ© story of good vs. evil. the story is stereotypical but it works. tolkien created his own world of middle-earth and it is filled with different races and languages. in the beginning magic rings were made but there was one ring made of pure evil one ring to rule them all. the maker of this ring was named sauron and long story short he was defeated but survived through the ring. the ring passed from person to person and it ended up in the hands of a hobbit named frodo baggins. he has been chosen to destroy the one ring before the armies of sauron destroy middle-earth. the storyline is very clichÍ©. it is a good vs. evil story of epic proportions. if you think you have seen this before you have but this is completely different. the little guy saves the day and nobody expected the hobbit with hairy feet to defeat the dark lord. one of the major aspects of this movie is the relationships between characters. gandalfs relationship with frodo and the ring. frodos relationship with sam gollum and the ring. gollums relationship with the ring. merrys relationship with pippin. all of these relationships drive this movie. nothing is more powerful then the relationship between frodo and sam. samwise gamgee is more than frodos best friend he is basically his protector. sam acts as a barrier between the evil of the ring. frodo could not have survived without sam and the roots of this trilogy are the relationship between frodo and sam. sauron has all the power of persuasion power of armies fear and all the power in the world. the only thing more powerful is the love and friendship between two young hobbits who take on this evil power. coming in second with relationships is between gollum and the ring. think about it gollum spent more time with the ring than anybody else excluding its master sauron. gollum lived with this ring for 500 years. it literally poisoned his mind and turned him into a gangly creature that you cant help but pity. he is easily my favorite character with his complexity and how it isnt his fault that he is the way he is. he is obsessed with the ring and calls it his precious. any fan of these movies knows what im talking about. over the span of three movies the audience gets their favorite characters and sees them develop. gimli and legolas didnt like each other at first because one was a dwarf and the other an elf. i never thought id die side by side with an elf gimli says in the final battle. how about side by side with a friend legolas answers. these two against all odds became friends and were inseparable. you also see merry and pippin evolve into something i know i did not expect. in the first movie they were silly and naÍöve but in the second movie merry begins to understand the dangers of the world and that it needs saving. pippin matures a bit late but nevertheless they are two of my favorite characters. these three movies are filled with incredible action scenes and special effects. from hobbiton to rivendell to helms deep and all the way to the crack of doom every place in middle-earth comes to life. the designers of these sets and cgi went into extreme detail and any fan of the movie should check out the six discs of special features. you learn how hobbiton was actually dug out in a hill in the ground in new zealand. my favorite battle has to be the battle of helms deep. it was 10000 uruk-hai vs. around 500 men and elves fighting at a castle that has defended the country of rohan for centuries. aragorn falls into his place as a leader and he develops into the man he needs to be in the third movie. these movies are made with incredible detail with every movie being made at once. peter jackson and his cast and crew spent 15 months in new zealand and filmed this masterpiece. costumes were made and weta workshop made all of the sets they needed and used miniatures and made the world of middle-earth come alive. actors took the books and looked for details fans would look for from the books. the only real problem with these movies is that if you dont know the story you cannot really enjoy the full experience. i saw the first movie when i was really young and i had no idea what it was about and i had to see the movies many many times before i knew what was going on. as soon as i did i was hooked and now i know almost everything there is to know about these movies. overall the lord of the rings is possibly the best trilogy ever made. the way the filmmakers dove into the world of middle-earth with such detail is commendable. this movie won so many awards made a bunch of money and it deserves everything it got. these are movie that need to be seen by anybody who even remotely likes the books and even if you dont go in pay attention and join the experience. lord of the rings is my favorite movie next to titanic and gets the willyt seal of approval.now i see what everybody was talking about. it took me 4 years to see this in my opinion masterpiece. if you have not seen this movie rent it anyway you can. the performances delivered by robbins and freeman are to me the pinnacle of both their careers. this film cannot help but evoke tactile imagery to the fullest capacity. you feel what the main characters are going through the sensation is uncanny. robbins andy and freeman red are a balance of the human spirit. andy is your freedom-seeking hope side and red is your rational pessimistic counterpart. find your equilibrium in the shawshank redemption.  aragorn turns to his men and says for frodo....then little merry and pippin run full speed. i have seen this film easily by itself about 15 times as a trilogy roughly 10 times. from shelobs layer to the battle of minas tirith it doesnt leave much to be desired jrr tolkein did a fantastic job writing the book and peter jackson did an amazing job portraying it to the big screen. if youve yet to see lotr watch it from the start and really take notice of everything because it has a lot to offer if you like being told a story. excellent 10/10 now here we are with the big one. the film that is often called the best film of the decade. the gigantic mass of epic known as the lord of the rings: return of the king. everyone looks at this film as the best. in fact not only the best but the best by far is what people consider this film to be. it was nominated for 11 oscars including best picture and won every oscar it was nominated for. it was a huge success and yes this film is fantastic. it is one of the biggest adventures i have ever seen. everything that was great in the first two are great here also. the writing visuals acting are all top notch stuff. so is it the best in the trilogy well i consider all 3 to stand together as one huge film experience. if any one of them didnt exist the others wouldnt be as good. all of them standing together give us a complete and epic adventure. 4 stars out of 4now after about 9 and a half years after we first watched the lord of the rings: the return of the king i and my friends decided to have a tolkien movie marathon watching the lord of the rings trilogy and the hobbit. as much as i adore tolkiens book and jacksons movies this is my absolute favorite. this is it you now the war saurons fall and aragorn becoming king. the top of the movie the absolute thrill is the arrival of the dead commanded by aragorn and its just a joyful felling watching them through minas tirith killing orcs. the cast is great but my favorite is sir ian mckellan. i thin he should have won an oscar for this role. hope that the hobbit 2 and 3 will be better. absolute success for jackson for that he has found inspiration in tolkiens book cause i dont think anybody else would have given us movies and cast as good as it is now.. so for that bravo cantt wait for the second hobbit movie :pnot really a lot you can you say about this film that hasnt already been said. one of my all time favourite films. how morgan freeman didnt get a best supporting oscar for this film ill never figure out. wonderful amazingly written film. the cast are superb tim robins always underrated as an actor. pulls you through every emotion. if you havent seen this film then you you dont know what youve been missing. a must have for any movie buff. it didnt do so well at the box office but this movies reputation has grown over the years through word of mouth showings on television and then of course along came the video then dvd rentals.not only the greatest story ever told but what and ending easily one of the best battle scenes to be seen and im not talking about minas tirith either im talking about at the gates of mordornot only is this film one of the most touching i have ever seen it also has one of the most unexpected and inspiring endings i have ever seen. the bond that grows between the two main characters is unforgettable and the  is the best ive heardnot my favorite film of all time but i think it is probably the last great movie of the decade sure the movie is super cool but it also happens to be fine filmmaking some people cuddle up to brain candy movies like forrest gump because they think a feel good movie is the only kind of emotionally compelling type of film out there there are other emotions to evoke besides sympathy or just plain ol garden variety sob-fest there are also movies which disturb you incite you etc pulp fiction is such a movie besides its got super cool dialogue and an ensemble cast that kicks @$$ everyone is at their best and havent topped those performances since i might add except for travolta in battlefield earth that was supposed to be sarcastic by the way bruce willis proves he can act to the world and very well too some of us already knew it and how can you not like a movie with a scene in which a hit man slams a gigantic needle into the chest of the wife of a mob boss who has overdosed on heroine how can you beat that 10/10 all the way babynot many people i knew of had confidence in peter jackson when it was announced he would be bringing these movies to life 11 years ago. me and my friends all loved heavenly creatures and bad taste is fun to watch but we werent confident in jacksons ability to make a blockbuster based off a book series i love to death. happilyi was wrong when we saw the fellowship of the ring in theaters. i found to be a successful tolkien adaptation and a great film in its own right. the two towers came and went and i was feeling confident about the final chapter in this epic trilogy. then came the day. i went to my nearest theater bought snacks plopped into my seat and had to datethe greatest film experience of all time. i literally sat in my seat not wanting to leave middle-earth behind when the credits finished. the adaptation was incredible. parts that felt odd in the book flowed better in the movieand changes were made that i still dont complain about. the acting was stellar the highlights being elijah wood sean astin viggo mortensen ian mckellan and bernard hill. the chills that went through me during the rohirrims charge the quiet explanation of death the entire climax at the cracks of doom and frodo leaving forever deserve to be hailed as some of the greatest moments in film history period. the music sound and visuals still hold up to date which to me says something. now as we wait for further news of the next peter jackson movies detailing more adventures in the lands of middle-earth we should take the time to look back onto why this is even possible. thank you peter jackson for making something that cant be ignored.not many movies have come out that make me stand up and cheer but pulp fiction definitely did just that quentin tarantino put together a movie with great characters an interesting intelligent storyline and pulp fiction set the standard for an entire genre of movies the way of the gun two days in the valley nothing has come close to the theatrical genius of pulp fictionnot many films can retain a certain air of gravitas without alienating the common movie goer. though nolan can be slated for making cerebral films that are dumbed down so that many can get it it is my belief that this is entirely a meritable ability. with the dark knight we see the clever story lines that nolan has become known for become fleshed out with enough action and thrilling suspense that there is no point where boredom starts to creep in. the characters still are believable enough that this film could take place within our modern day society. unlike the usual batman films which have been slightly camp affairs with characters that are bound to fiction nolan manages to keep the joker just real enough that the audience fears what he will do next. every watch of this film highlights the depths to which every actor in this film went and most of all how developed ledgers joker was. i am not an entirely unbiased critic and me saying that i use this film as a comparison for most other films with ledgers joker in my mind being the perfect acting performance should be taken with a pinch of salt though i believe this film to be one of the stand out creations of our generation.  music visuals script and acting. these elements each equally important must succeed independently yet still form a harmonious union because this mixture determines the fate of the artists opus. though already well known amongst his colleagues for his notable skills at writing and directing frank darabont emerges with his feature film directorial debut the shawshank redemption. proving himself already a master of the craft darabont managed to create one of the most recognizable independent releases in the history of hollywood. the shawshank redemption defines a genre defies the odds compels the emotions and brings an era of artistically influential films back to hollywood. the story begins with the trial of a young banker andy dufrense victimized by circumstantial evidence resulting in a conviction for the murder of his wife and her lover. after a quick conviction andy finds himself serving a life sentence at shawshank prison with no hope of parole. he exists in this prison only in appearance keeping his mind free from the drab walls around him. his ability to do this results in the gaining of respect from his fellow inmates but most of all from ellis redding. ellis commonly referred to as red finds gainful use of his entrepreneurial spirit within the drab walls of shawshank by dealing in contraband and commodities rare to the confines of prison. andys demeanor and undeniable sense of hope causes red to take a deeper look at himself and the world around him. andy proves to red and the other inmates that in the conventional walls of shawshank prison convention will find no home in his lifestyle. by creating the films firm foundation the meticulously chiseled screenplay paved the way for this films success. frank darabont outdoes himself with the phenomenal adaptation of stephen kings equally noteworthy novella rita hayworth and shawshank redemption. in this novella king demonstrates that he can break free from the genre he dominates and still create a marvelous piece of modern literature. though the film mirrors the novella in many ways darabont illustrates a focused objective of improving upon the areas where the novella came up short resulting in one of the best book to film transitions ever. while maintaining some of the poetic and moving dialogue of the novella darabont also proves that a films  can generate a great deal of emotional response from its audience as dialogue does. he employs the cunning thomas newman son of the legendary hollywood composer alfred newman. darabont shows recognition for the films needs by employing newman who makes the gentle piano chords whisper softly to the viewer as if a part of the scripted dialogue. newman lends himself to individualism and tends to drive more towards the unique in the realm of  composition. his effort in shawshank did not go unnoticed as his  received an oscar nomination in 1995. while unique and independent newmans  never once intrudes on your concentration or distracts from the film. with work from vast array of talented scene designers costume designers composers cinematographers and various other hollywood artists the cast of the shawshank redemption had a strong foundation to work with. the marvelous cast of this film will dazzle you with some of the most convincing performances you will witness in a film. while both tim robbins and morgan freeman shine as andy and red respectively the true spectacle of acting lies within the plethora of amazing supporting actors who easily disappear into their roles. most noticeable of these the veteran film star james whitmore who portrays the elderly brooks hatlen. brooks a man incarcerated for an unmentioned crime for so long that he finds himself attached to the shawshank and the daily life he has lead. each of these actors show a true dedication to their art and a focused purpose in their motivations creating a convincing setting that never once caters to anything unbelievable. with all of the aesthetic touches and attention to cinematic detail the most beautiful part of the film lies within its thematic material such as its focus on the human desires for the most abstract concepts like hope and freedom. these themes which concern things the human spirit undoubtedly yearns for seem so intricately woven into the plot that it easily draws its audience in to its story. though full of hardened criminals your heart will go out to these men as they display the most basic of human emotions and deliver some of the most quotable lines in a film to date. like a great novel this film manages to succeed at greater things than simply entertaining an audience. darabont tells his story most masterfully illustrating principles and inspiring his audience to think. he leaves us a poignant film with a powerful message of hope and redemption something we all seek. this film manages to redeem hollywood in the eyes of people who feared it long lost in a dark sea of clichÍ©s and predictability. darabont shows us that artists still work in the hollywood studios and production facilities. these artists show their capability to produce art  real art that inspires you to look at the deeper aspects of life and the world around you. the shawshank redemption delivers much-needed breath of fresh air for anyone who realizes the capability of film. it proves that masters of the craft still live on this earth and still bless us with timeless masterpieces that we will never forget.not being a huge fan of superhero movies i didnt have much expectations for batman begins. however viewing the 2005 christopher nolan production i was pleasantly shocked. then after my huge expectations for the dark knight christopher nolan blew my expectations to the dust. will the same happen with the 3rd and last film the dark knight rises quite simply yes my big expectations were once again blown away. what a production this is a true cinematic experience to behold. the movie exceeded my expectations in terms of action and entertainment. the editing sound  visuals direction and action are all top notch. this movie is amazing. it is interesting like all of batman are. when the end of the movie comes you start to turn surprised and you do not hope that. although this is the best thing of that movies. im in love with them. i do not know when this movie ends you are like: oh my god really it just happened there are no words to explain the feeling this movie causes in you. i love it. i suggest this movie to all the fiction lovers like me. you gonna love this movie. seriously.normally a summer blockbuster this huge can never for some reason deliver on both acting and the usual crazy action. most of what happens in this movie is pretty bad and i mean bad. but i am not going to spoil that for you. i have never seen a movie as brilliant as this. every scene in the movie has to be there for if you wood just scrap it the movie would somehow collapse because there is a bit of information the audience did not get. and i have to say that this christopher nolan batman franchise is really up there for me with star wars indiana jones and the lord of the rings. this story really tells you why the joker is who he is and why batman becomes who he must become. because this joker is all about destruction and chaos. really looking forward to the dark knight rises.nolans directing is sublime the pacing of the movie was so well kept managing to keep the audience enthralled in an almost 3 hour movie. there were several shots in the film that had me saying now how in the hell did they do that brilliant s by james newton howard and hans zimmer. every actor shines no one person steals the film. i dont want to say much about it because whatever is said cannot do it justice there is enough hype surrounding its release but its there for a reason. top notch film. bravo to nolan and his crew for giving a movie that batman truly deserves.brilliant s by james newton howard and hans zimmer. every actor shines no one person steals the film. i dont want to say much about it because whatever is said cannot do it justice there is enough hype surrounding its release but its there for a reason. top notch film. bravo to nolan and his crew for giving a movie that batman truly deserves.nolan returns to the helm of what many consider the perfect batman film. bale caine oldman freeman murphy and mcfarlane all reprise their roles spectacularly and flawlessly without upstaging one another nor their performances from begins. holmes is replaced with gyllenhaal who look nothing alike but the story itself is too strong to be setback by a recast. heath ledger portrays the most chaotic and theatrical -- yet most convincing memorable and realistic -- joker to date. the joker is as amusing as he is intimidating and will stop at nothing. ledgers role isnt as pronounced as nicholsons was in the 1989 film which is actually a stronger move because it avoids any upstaging. hans zimmers wonderful muddling  just adds to the jokers prominence. eckhart makes harvey dent his own. nolan succeeds in continuing an absolutely plausible take on a renewed batman series_„_ its almost too real for some people. its conservative undertones can be excused for its moral depth. **** out of four  from the cinematography to the acting the casting the writing...everything. its a fantastic example of the power of hope and the true nature of the human spirit. when you watch it you just know that every scene is classic  so many moments will be remembered forever in film history. if anything it just keep getting better with each time i see it. i will continue to enjoy this film for the rest of my life.nolan made a wise decision in separating the dark knight from batman begins in that he never tries to mimic it. while the dark and gritty feel of begins is certainly prevalent in the sequel knight is its own film with its own story. it rarely if ever feels like batman begins 2. it goes without saying that the performances are stellar but i cant not praise the actors. christian bale is as he needs to be as is morgan freeman michael caine and gary oldman. even though maggie gyllenhaal was cast due to katie holmess inability to return i think she was a necessary change in order to show rachels growth. aaron eckhart is always a joy to watch and he certainly doesnt disappoint here. heath ledger deserves an oscarnolan is one of the best director ever wonderful gotham risk and superb joker excellent one of the best batman movies ever and i just applause after the movie was end great movie great sequel great trilogy and so this is recommended for superhero maniac good job nolan. and also the dark knight rises maybe a loser after watching this movie. great ending and just great plan vs. great power. maybe some good movies arent better like this. joker inspired we that a good person will be fallen and will be same-asshole-like a criminal a great movie for a great person that love batman and bales acting was amazing alfred was greatnolan has made another exceptional movie.he has given a new identity to joker. not like the other batman seriesthis one is a sure winner. excellent casting and the dialogues are witty. heath ledger steals the show.gotham city was portrayed in a nice manner. hans zimmer has done an excellent job in scoring the background theme. coming to the field of screenplayit keeps the audience engaged throughout the movie and jokers next move keeps everyone guessing. the movie gives us a hint that there will be a sequel to this one. on the whole it is a well knit movie with excellent acting skills. we can expect more from christopher nolan in the future.  about continuity in a lifetime based on friendship and hope that can reduce the most hardened into misty-eyed wonderment. the shawshank redemption warrants repeated viewing nolan has done it again with arguably his best work ever i must say first i am not a comic book reader nor have i ever been. although i like some heroes more than others i am not a very big batman fan either. i just never thought he was that special or a good superhero more like a rich man with armor and guns. while i was never a big fan of batman i am a huge fan of the dark knight this movie was perfect nothing short of perfect. first off i tip my hat to the late heath ledger for his flawless performance of the joker. second christopher nolan has shined once again. i saw this in theaters and when i left i was amazed. not only was the overall movie very well paced and interesting the ending was perfect: batman took the wrap for two-faces crimes so gotham could keep their hero while batman became the enemy. truly incredible. even the music was great..hans zimmer never fails his music was great in inception too also a nolan movie. i didnt think the sequel to batman begins would be as good i was wrong it was 5x better if you want a movie that is serious but also exciting and amazing the dark knight should be at the top of your list. 10/10 truly a great all time movie.no words could give enough justice to this film. it is truly a masterpiece. me and my friend decided to go to see this film in the cinema as we wanted to see heath ledger in this final film. i am so glad i went to see this movie. ill admit that i wasnt sure whether to go and this film at first as im not really a big fan of batman and have never seen any of the other movies to do with batman. i am glad i took the chance to go and see the dark knight because it was such a treat. the joker was my favourite character and not because heath ledger portrayed him. i found myself feeling sorry for the joker and then not liking him and there has only been one other movie that has made me feel that way the godfather. christian bale was great as batman and in my opinion they could not have cast anyone better for the part. heath ledger really did go out with a bang as he astounded me with his acting. the dark knight was truly his best role that he has played well at least thats what i think. my list of favourite movies always changes but i know that this one will stay at the top for years to come. hope my review helped.nick dunne ben affleck lives in the small riverside missouri town that he grew up in it hasnt always been so for a number of years nicky worked in manhattan as a journalist where he met his brilliant wife amy rosamunde pike also a writer amy grew up in the area with two somewhat famous authorparents who concocted

stunning with affleck and pike doing grand work while neil patrick harris tyler perry kim dickens and all of the others are fantastic too the watery setting is likewise intriguing but its the story script and direction that towers above everything else gillian flynn who wrote the novel has fashioned a script that mirrors the book and is quite wonderful as for the direction david fincher with great editing too keeps the relentless pace and mystery in every moment equally good is his camera shots opting to fade in and out with visual power so add it up and the sum is one fantastic flick indeed as mikey said long ago oh yeah shes gone and viewers wouldnt want it any other waynice movie best batman part love the joker sorry that he died waiting for the new movie nice movie best batman

as i was while watching the dark knight. its a peach of a movie and is fraught with every element a movie needs to create history. not everyday you come across a movie like this. spectacular to say the least. the dark knight starts its journey from where batman begins ended and slowly we get into the gripping duel of the batman and the joker as the beautifully crafted story scarily moves into its epic climax. not only is the plot an engrossing epic it has a sense of an agonizing tragedy which hits you and gets into you. kudos to nolan who is maturing with every film for his impeccable direction and awesome portrayal of batman. the way he has portrayed the psyche of the joker harvey dent and batman and the way he has convoluted the story-line by pitting against each other the complicated ideologies of good and evil is sensational. not to forget the electrifying performances of almost everybody who has been in this movie. bale is flawless as usual and he handles the dual role of wayne and batman with perfection. aaron eckhart shines as harvey dent and maggie gyllenhaal does a far better job as rachel than katie holmes did in batman begins. michael caine is as usual proper as alfred but the icing on the cake surely is heath ledger. mr ledger pulls off a stunner and oh man is he not good quite rightly an oscar winning performancedeserving all the accolades that has been showered upon him and sadly his last. may he rest in peace. folks to sum up all i can say is that the dark knight is by all means one of the greatest movies that has ever been made if not the greatest. please dont miss this and be prepared to be mesmerizedmy wife and myself parents of three little kids rarely get to go to the cinema. two weeks ago during our holidays we got my parent to babysit the little monsters so that we can finally get out again. taking a peek into the papers actually *real* papers i had no internet access :-  revealed that the dark knight was the only watchable movie playing in the small nearby town. somewhat reluctantly we decided to give it a try. what the hell we thought we are on holidays anyway why not check a kids movie sorry to all fans of previous batman movies but thats just what i think of them. boy were we surprised after the movie it took us a few minutes before we both burst out this is one of the best movies i ever saw i wont go into any details for the multitude of excellent comments on this board already presents this movie as it is: a masterpiece especially the performance of the late heath ledger joker was unbelievable posthumous oscar anyone i actually felt quite nervous and actually even a bit scared during some joker scenes - something i didnt experience that often in a movie theater and yet we both felt that quite a few lines of his could have been from us... :- its a must please go watch it either in a real movie theater or in a damn good home theater. while the special effects in this movie are just what they *should* be a mere vehicle to transport the message the atmosphere of the movie just wont come over if you watch it on a 19 monitor with your 5.1 headset on... :- id gladly pay again to see it one more timemy wife and i went to boyhood on its opening day in christchurch new zealand we had recently seen the trailer and were keen to see the film it did not disappoint us the acting was excellentso good that at times we found we forgot we were watching a movie rather than a documentary it was great to see an understated american movie rather than the overblown dialogue* and direction we so often seehear its a long movie but time just flew we have two adult sons and although life and culture in nz is not the same as shown in boyhood we found many situations in the movie which struck a chord for us i would write more but other reviewers have expressed it much better than i suffice it to say of all the movies i have seen in the last 68 years this one goes straight into my top 10 *what i call the seinfeld syndrome theres a joke coming raise eyebrows look at camera    did you get thatill say it againmy story is one of fate. i went to the video store expecting to get terminator ii on laserdisc. it was out and out of desperation to rent something i asked for what was new. i was given the shawshank redemption. i had never heard of it quite honestly but i gave it a try but was not expecting much but two hours of time pass. the first time through watching it i thought it was good. nothing extraordinary. but something made me watch it again. and i was hooked. i cant explain it but this movie gets better every time you watch it. i ended up watching it about 8 times in that 4 day timespan. watch this movie as your bucket list of things to do in life. you really have not lived till you have seen it. i admit to being completely obsessed by the movie owning it on every medium imaginable and having all the books and posters about it. but do not let my obsession dissuade you. i do not impress easily but i can tell you this is simply the greatest movie ever made in cinema. every moment and every dialog of this movie fits in perfectly to create the greatest masterpiece in american cinema.my overall review for the movie  it was amazing. its a masterpiece. i mean i have never watched any superhero movie this good. what an acting performance by heath this is the only villain which is more liked than the actual hero. and a whole lot of good direction by nolan. hattsoff to him.the story overall describes the fearthe pain and the agony that dark knight suffers. this movie is a must must must watch.n addition to new characters like harvey dent played superbly by aaron eckhart by the way all significant characters from nolans previous film batman begins return for this new adventure. police lieutenant jim gordon played by gary oldman bruce waynes faithful butler alfred played by michael caine waynes go-to guy for fancy gizmos lucius fox played by morgan freeman and assistant da and waynes love interest rachel dawes played this time by maggie gylenhaal are all back and have respectable roles to play here but the dark knight is ultimately about batman and the joker. its a much darker film than any of the previous batman movies and it goes into directions that few comic-book films have taken before. much of that edginess comes from the joker and his sinister plans. not merely content at killing his enemies the joker chooses to psychologically torment his rivals by forcing them to question what they stand for.my life is forever changed due to this movie. it is a movie of hope redemption and friendship. it shows a deep growing friendship between two prisoners andy and red. they each are shown growing through their distinct hardships at shawshank prison. as time passes hope wanes but a flame burns bright in andy. his hope and unrelentless nature carry over to his friend red. as reds long stay in prison comes to an end he sees the light at the end of the tunnel. andy has left it for him to see the way to freedom and he follows it. this film parallels my life and leaves me wondering if my advice will help somebody see the light. for some of those people time will tell. as for now ill be patient to wait and see. dont end up like brooks there will always be someone to help you out. there is someone out there that cares for you. thank you andy dufresne your hope is the flame of my life.my favorite of the series ghost protocol 2nd this film s high marks all the way around the story acting and directing all are first class i read that many people who have seen the movie for the first time were confused by the plot so was i but after screening it a second time i was pleasantly surprised at the many subtle nuances to the story there really were its a story that doesnt treat you like a child so many movies directors think they have to go out of there way to spell everything out for the audience scenes that have no other purpose than to drive home an obvious point not this one if i had my way brian de palma would have been involved in the other three de palma was the only one who captured the feel and the look of what i thought the movie should have been if youve only seen it once see it again and enjoy it for the classic that it ismy favorite movie of all times. excellentbrilliantexquisite.... soooooo emotional and so epic at the same timethe best example is the scene when king theoden encourages his soldiersand tells themthat they have to fight because there are greater things at stakes than their lives. i cry every time. the battle for minas tirith is very dramaticmakes you sit at the edge of your seat all the time. the ending contains very tolkien-like feelinghappiness mixed with a bit of grief and loss. if there is anyone on this planet who havent seen it yetknowyou are very wrongthis movie is worth your timeand it will give you so much pleasure.my favorite movie ever. these are words that basically describe how i feel about this movie. a prison drama does not sound like an entertaining movie but this is very entertaining. tim robbins the player i.q. stars as andy dufresne a smart man convicted of killing his wife and her lover. he arrives at shawshank prison completely out of place but adapts and becomes best friends with one of the prisons head convicts wonderfully played by morgan freeman driving miss daisy seven. soon the warden played by bob gunton midnight in the garden of good and evil broken arrow enlists his help as a banker to help with getting some extra illegal money and other things. it doesnt sound like a great movie but trust me this is the best movie ive ever seen and everyone i know liked it. tim robbins is great in the lead. bob gunton is good as the twisted warden. william sadler solo die hard 2 is solid as a fellow convict. clancy brown starship troopers highlander is excellent as the sadistic head of the guards. finally james whitmore the relic and gil bellows snow white: a tale of terror give the best supporting performances as fellow convicts. a must see.my favorite movie by far. the path of the righteous man is beset on all sides by the inequities of the selfish and the tyranny of evil men. blessed is he who in the name of charity and good will shepherds the weak through the valley of darkness for he is truly his brothers keeper and the finder of lost children. and i will strike down upon thee with great vengeance and furious anger those who would attempt to poison and destroy my brothers. and you will know my name is the lord when i lay my vengeance upon thee. the path of the righteous man is beset on all sides by the inequities of the selfish and the tyranny of evil men. blessed is he who in the name of charity and good will shepherds the weak through the valley of darkness for he is truly his brothers keeper and the finder of lost children. and i will strike down upon thee with great vengeance and furious anger those who would attempt to poison and destroy my brothers. and you will know my name is the lord when i lay my vengeance upon thee.  the serious violence of american gangster movies. prizefighter butch coolidge has decided to stop payment on a deal hes made with the devil. honey bunny and pumpkin are young lovers and small time thieves who decide they need a change of venue. meanwhile two career criminals vincent vega and jules go about their daily business of shooting up other crooks that are late on payments to their boss. while one is asked to baby sit their boss dangerously pretty young wife the other suddenly realizes that he must give up his life of crime. my ex-girlfriend refuses to watch this one and shell probably still live a fulfilled life but for those of us who can never regain our innocence you have to admit this is one hell of a movie some of the sharpest funniest dialogue ever written yes a bit contrived at times some times tarantino sounds like hes trying to sound like tarantino but still stunning the verbal sparring is every bit as exciting and violent as the blood and bullets and little bits of brain interesting postmodern take on spirituality camus wouldve been proud even if jules conversion was based on the possibly incorrect assumption that god had directly intervened in his life postmodernism says hey what they hell go for it its not any more or less true than anything else so more power to you praise be to god interesting tarantino is sometimes criticized for being too clever with his influences and allusions but i dont think thats true of pulp fiction yes we can see shades of kiss me deadly deliverance etc but i dont think they take over the movie also the music works in the movie but not in my opinion on the soundtrack cd tarantino was once asked if he had intentionally put songs like jungle boogie in with the intent to be campy but q said that basically he didnt care what was considered corny and what was considered art he just knew he liked it probably gives us a little insight into his view of movie making toomy brother had told me about this a month or two before it was to come out and i watched the trailer and found myself really looking forward to the film i love action films and the fact that my brother had described it as alex rider but better set my hopes pretty high and i was not disappointed matthew vaughn is a great director and it is an unspoken rule in my house that if stardust is on tv we must watch it and i also loved kick ass this film had the slight gore of the latter which is fine by me since ive always watched films like that and the characters and aspects that dont turn out to be how they look on the surface in my opinion the perfect balance has been achieved between comedy violence action and even tragedyseriousness the actors used are amazing in their parts and it is a star studded cast of michael cain colin firth samuel l jackson and mark strong but i think that taron egerton gives an amazing film debut performance ive read some reviews where it has been described as laddish and brash but what else can you expect from a 15 rated spy film based on teenager from south london? in fact eggsys contrast to the typical gentleman spy is what makes this film so good we need more films that are like this one and push boundaries on the genres that we are used to i came out of the cinema desperate to talk about it with my friends but none of them have seen it so i will have to think about how good it is by myself it is also the first film that i have come out of cinema desperate to actually buy a copy of the filmmy boyfriend and i got invited to a prescreening first time ever and we had no idea what kind of film this was going to be i knew the actor from the kings speech and my bf told me this was by the same director who had done x men first class which i think is the best but because of the main actor i thought this would be some british comedy i was not prepared for this hilarious crazy action film its really really funny and its very violent i dont know whether many women are going to like it i do but i prefer south park over sex and the city and i usually hate chick flicks it is a comedy but not what youd expect and despite this being not at all like xmen i absolutely loved the film and samuel jackson is in the film if you like spy movies and if youre not offended by gory violence and very dirty language go watch this film the last 30 minutes or so are like the craziest ive ever seen in an action film and i have seen a lot of action films believe me the storyline is a bit like men in black without aliens and the young actor who plays the rookie is perfect in this part the film might not be very realistic but i thought this was one of the best action comedies i have seen in a long timemy biggest beef was on so much missing about aragon and i found most of them in the dvd. one of the vital elements in the fellowships strategy is to draw saurons eye away from frodo and here aragons role is crucial. the last debate in the movie is totally inadequate in explaining the suicidal march to the black gate but the dvd makes it very clear with the additional scene of aragon revealing himself to sauron though the palantir. he is the bait that sauron cannot resist. another important aspect is that aragon comes into the city of minas tirith first and foremost as a healer not as a king. the kingship comes afterwards. this is again brought out in the additional scenes in the dvd although still missing a lot of details from the book. still disappointing even for the dvd is that so little is given to the story of eowyn and faramir. the dialogue through which they come to accept each other could very well be the most beautiful in the entire book. the few shots in the dvd that trace the development of their relationship are far from adequate although thats a least a slight improvement from the film version. another disappointment is aragons arrival at the pelennor fields which is hopelessly lame compared with the original treatment in the book: amidst the despair of the rohan and gondor soldiers in witnessing the approaching black ships aragons standard suddenly unfurls at the main mast: there flowered a white tree and that was for gondormuch too often these days superlatives are thrown around to describe the greatness of movies and music. in this case any superlative used is an understatement. this is unlike anything that has ever been made and probably ever will be made. few films i have seen can stir as many emotions as effectively as rotk. after more than three hours the film still leaves the audience wanting more. if there is any justice rotk would sweep every awards ceremony in existence. combined with fellowship and two towers the unprecedented trilogy helmed by peter jackson towers over any achievement in the medium in scope character and impact. the bar has been raised and the standard has been surpassed. motion pictures will never be the same.  and as well dont spend ever hour of the day sitting at home sharpening their knives. although the sopranos later perfected and brought reasoning to this fact making their characters part of society and disguising themselves as members pulp fiction places them within the daily activities of an odd group distinguishes them from ordinary civilians and keeps them afloat through simplistic dialogue demonstrating the needs and wants of a first world audience  such as relationships religion or something as simple as what to eat for breakfast  and i dont know about you but i was thoroughly disappointed when fabienne had to get buttermilk pancakes instead of blueberry. it feels like a clichÍ© to say it but for a long time pulp fiction was my favorite film. it was as influential to me in 2010 as it was to the people who first saw it in the mid-90s. i could go on for hours discussing the unconventional style of chronology the homages to such films as the bodyguard : jules famous ezekiel 25:17 biblical quote is shown within the films opening crawl on the waterfront : bruce willis character butchs resemblance to marlon brandos character through a self-dilemma or the aristocats : from the famous twist-dance contest where uma thurman bases her moves from that of the duchess character in the 1970 disney animation. yet what makes the film so unique is not the homages to films or magazines mainstream audiences wouldnt recognize nor the bleak humor but through these characters and their reflections through an array of bizarre and oddly connected events. i continue to adore this film for several rationales but to me the people were always the most specific. they were original just like the film and shaped the american audience into viewers ready to find enjoyment from extraordinary people discussing foot massages and european hamburgers for several minutes of screen time. quentin tarantino... you are a geniusmuch has been written and praised deservedly so about the shawshank redemption. the fact that its #1 on this list gives me faith in humanity. instead of talking about its obvious care with excellent writing directing editing and cinematography ill just say how much the film has meant to me personally. its message of hope and above all perseverance kept me going through many of lifes travails. i think i responded to how it dealt with the day-to-day grind of life albeit in dramatic fashionand even the stress of boredom. the other thing it demonstrated was how profoundly one person can affect another without even saying much to them. after all andy and red only have one true baring-their-souls conversation in 19 years together one of the greatest scenes in the history of movies by the way. yet we are fully aware of how much these two meant to each other and how moved we are when they are reunited. its a real spiritual journey visually as well  it is before these walls that the doom of our time will be decided. the city is a spectacular achievement by the special- effects artisans who show it as part fortress part emerald city topping a mountain with a buttress reaching out over the plain below where the battle will be joined. in a scene where gandalf rides his horse across the drawbridge and up the ramped streets of the city its remarkable how seamlessly jackson is able to integrate computer- generated shots with actual full-scale shots so they all seem of a piece. jacksons achievement cannot be denied. the return of the king is such a crowning achievement such a visionary use of all the tools of special effects such a pure spectacle that it can be enjoyed  tolkiens story is so sweeping and jackson includes so much of it that only devoted students of the ring can be sure they understand every character relationship and plot point.movies simply do not get better than this. inspiring captivating intense funny at times tragic at times. interesting and thrilling. every aspect of this movie is perfection: the acting story dialog production setting cinematography etc... all perfect. this film is truly flawless. i could not describe this movie as fun but i would describe it is unparalleled in its excellence- and not in some stupid artsy sense- just plain and simple it is story telling at its finest. if you havent seen this movie you absolutely need to watch it right now. fantastic. i wish i could give it a higher rating than 10 out of 10 stars.mission impossible tells the story of wrongly disavowed secret agent ethan hunt trying to prevent the theft of a list of all the secret agents in the world with the help of two other disavowed agents played by ving rhames and jean reno while all this is going on he must find the true mole in his agency that set him up mission impossible is the perfect film for anyone who enjoys a good spy movie the plot is quick and to the point it never lets up for a minute unfortunately when it comes to spy movies im left stumped with some of the details with mission impossible even though they talk about things that are hard for the layman to understand it can be easily figured out before the end of the film but who cares anyway? the action scenes are amazing particularly the famous sequence of ethan hunt dangling from a ceiling and catching a sweat droplet so it doesnt trigger the alarm since im young i never had the pleasure of watching the tv show but if it was anything like this movie im sure id truly enjoy it all the roles in the film are played very well i particularly enjoyed the fact that ethan hunts team is made up of well established actors such as jon voight emilio estevez and kristen scott thomas youre saying great cast this should be good then without a moments notice theyre all dead in the first 10 minutes mission impossible is an amazing thrill ride movie just what youd expect from the director of scarface and the untouchables 810mission impossible is an action thriller that features tom cruise as ethan huntit directed by brian de palmabased on from the television series of the same name the story follows a new agentethan huntplayed by tom cruisehis new mission is to uncover the mole within the cia who has framed him for the murders of his entire imf team this film are shot

confusing but if you listen closely you should be able to follow it it has an incredible amount of suspense and intrigue and i would recommend it to anyone who is tired of the same formulaic bondtype movies the ending is probably my favorite in any movie and is well worth sitting through some of the dialoguebased scenes in the end there is nothing not to like about this movie if you find it confusing you are probably used to badly written movies this movie was not written for audiences and is not meant to be easy to understand it is more believable that way i think 910mission impossible a 1996 film directed by brian de palma is a great film i do know others have found it jarring with a confusing storyline and i have to somewhat agree however there are many other elements which make this a very enjoyable film  first and foremost i love the cinematography  the tilted angles which shows how chaotic the situation that ethan hunt played by tom cruise is put in jim phelps played by jon voight expertly plays his mentor in an interesting role ving rhames stars as luther stickell the only other character besides ethan hunt who is in all 3 films so far emmanuelle beart as claire phelps also makes an appealing love interest the action sequences are topnotch especially the helicopter sequence at the end and the music is very fitting by master composer danny elfman i would recommend this film  a high 8 out of 10misery and stand by me were the best adaptations up until this one now you can add shawshank to that list. this is simply one of the best films ever made and i know i am not the first to say that and i certainly wont be the last. the standing on the imdb is a true barometer of that. #3 as of this date and im sure it could be number 1. so ill just skip all the normal praise of the film because we all know how great it is. but let me perhaps add that what i find so fascinating about shawshank is that stephen king wrote it. king is one of the best writers in the world. books like it and the castle rock series are some of the greatest stories ever told. but his best adaptations are always done by the best directors. the shining was brilliantly interpreted by kubrick and of course the aforementioned misery and stand by me are both by rob reiner. now frank darabont comes onto the scene and makes arguably the best king film ever. he seems to understand what king wants to say and he conveys that beautifully. what makes this film one of the best ever made is the message it conveys. it is one of eternal hope. andy dufresne played by tim robbins has been sent to prison for a crime he did not commit. but he never loses hope. he never gives up his quest to become a free man again. his years of tenacity patience and wits keep him not only sane but it gives his mind and a spirit a will to live. this film has a different feel to it. there has never been anything like it before and i dont know if there will again. im not going to say any more about this film it has already been said but just suffice to say that i am glad that forrest gump won best picture in 94. i would have been equally glad if pulp fiction or shawshank would have won. it is that good of a movie and one that will be appreciated for years to come.minor spoilers but only if you havent read the book. some of the more awe inspiring moments for me were the rohirim riding into battle at gondor faramir leading his troops into osgillioth against impossible odds the moment pippin becomes a man so to speak and the whole of minas tirith bowing down to four halflings who might earlier have been dismissed as insignificant... its moments like these that allow you to forgive the hollywood showboating of orlando bloom on the battlefield and other such excesses.  watch it and just go along with it. if you feel inclined to look up how it played out on the internet go ahead or if you want to give it a rewatch that is fine too. viewing multiple clips for a second time i think i finally understand it more but a lot of questions youll still be asking after repeated viewings. one of the most famous questions is whats in the briefcase that is recovered by vega and winnfield in the early scenes of the film. im sure when writing the film tarantino himself didnt know what he wanted to put in the briefcase. im also sure he didnt think it would blow up into such a debacle on the message boards and through word of mouth. what truly makes pulp fiction worthwhile is the genius dialog. tarantino cranks out the best script possible combined with enough wit and violence to please the most demanding and picky action-film fan. one moment the two are discussing why a quarter pounder with cheese from mcdonalds is called a royale with cheese in france. next they are threatening violence if a victim asks the question what again. why do i not condone constant swearing and gratuitous violence in other films but for some reason award a perfect  to a film that is made up of it because pulp fiction shows how it should be done. it depicts realistic situations handled intelligently and with wit and soul. it doesnt utilize them for the purpose of being monotonous or dreary but to advance an already crafty storyline. the character are under such stress it only makes sense that they are constantly shouting four letter words. is it necessary not really. but pulp fiction isnt just about swearing. it proves that true cinema still exists and that even a story that appears choppy and inconsistent on paper can still produce one of the best films of the decade. starring: john travolta samuel l. jackson uma thurman harvey keitel tim roth amanda plummer maria de medeiros ving rhames eric stoltz rosanna arquette christopher walken bruce willis and quentin tarantino. directed by: quentin tarantino. mild spoilers ahead. like many people i had very high expectations when i walked into the theater today but unlike some people whos reviews ive read here i wasnt disappointed. i loved this film. sure there are things that are bothering like they way certain characters are changed as in the case of faramir and denethor - and theoden as well in my opinion or completely left out as in the case of saruman and grÍ_ma. but there is so much beauty in this film which makes up for it. the musical  is amazing. someone here loathed howard shore for writing pompous and sentimental music - i dont understand it. this is the most wonderful soundtrack i have ever heard except for maybe the one in fellowship of the ring. if this is not rewarded with an oscar in february something is very very wrong. during the first two movies i was always bothered by the fact that merry and pippin were turned into comic figures simply there to lighten up serious moments. in this movie billy boyd and dominic monaghan finally get to work a little more on their characters - characters which i love. and they do it so well. i have to admit that my absolute favourite moment in the movie was pippin singing before denethor while the battle goes on outside. it was a beautiful and very strong scene. does anyone think that the academy will remember billy boyd when its time for the oscars but there were things that were left out that should not have been mainly in the ending. there were no explanations to how faramir eowyn or merry were suddenly healed there was nothing with pippin being in minas tirith before the battle and as i said saruman and grÍ_ma were left out. not good. one can only hope there will be more of this in the extended version of the dvd. im very much looking forward to it  legolas the elf  gimli the dwarf  aragorn and boromir both men  and three other hobbits sam merry and pippin. this unlikely alliance comes together in a spirit of acceptance and tolerance to fight the satanic sauron and his devilish henchmen. those of us who do not consider ourselves fans of fantasy initially may have thought to dismiss the movies as far-fetched overblown silliness. it was hard to imagine the films as relevant or transcending their genre. but many of us have come around to another point of view: the films tell a classic story that espouses the virtues of love hard work and compassion and decries greed deceit and abuse of power in a mighty struggle against temptation and the corrupting forces of power. the storys message about conserving natural resources has profound significance for our times as does the notion of taking up arms against an evil tyrant and the importance of overcoming prejudice to work toward a common goal of peace. ironically these simple messages were massively complicated to pull off requiring a budget of nearly $300 million a crew of 26000 extras and a production team of 2400 which included medieval weapons designers stone sculptors linguists blacksmiths and model builders. bringing to life such a wide-ranging story with technical proficiency and visual dazzle is an unprecedented achievement one that likely will define jackson much as george lucas is forever linked to the star wars movies he directed. though the acting ensemble is strong the movie does not belong to any one of them. while elijah wood capably carries off frodos transition from boy to man his is not the most indelible performance. gollum voiced by and physically patterned after the movements of british actor andy serkis is the most realistic other-worldly character since e.t. and similarly will remain etched in moviegoers collective memories. ian mckellens gandalf has a larger role in the third film morphing from wizard/prophet to army general and one cannot imagine the role played by anyone else. viggo mortensens principled aragorn is the king to whom the third films title refers. a key character is the landscape of middle-earth. the movies feel mythical but look historical. in the third installment for example minas tirith a seven-tiered city of kings looks european byzantine and fantastical at the same time. there is a bittersweet quality in the trilogys coming to an end _„î even if the return of the king seems ready to conclude at least three times before the movie finally comes to a rather anticlimactic close. many moviegoers like jackson and the cast _„î who grew quite close during filming _„î may understand and even appreciate the lingering goodbye. and while s of film goers clamor to see the final installment no one is eager for the journey to end. jacksons masterpiece will no doubt have a long life on dvd and be the subject of countless revivals over the years. the directors next project is a remake of king kong which seems a bit like hiring michelangelo to paint an office building. though if anyone can make something out of that tired vehicle jackson can. should jackson sign on to make the hobbit the rings finale might feel more like a temporary till we meet again than a formal goodbye. maybe im writing a review too late for this movie but i think i must write something for this. shawshank redemption is a truly a class movie that teaches us many things like friendship and never gave up your hope. unlike other users i think this movie deserves to be in imdb top 250 list. today imdbs top 250 list approved and considered by everyone. so everybody must see that this movie is in top and must watch it to see why imdb puts this movie on top and not godfather. i really like the role of red by morgan freeman. he really acts like a experienced jail-mate. andy dufresne is okay too. what i really like is that i really love the end. maybe this is the best ending ever. i really like how red laughs to andy about pickaxe and andy dig 19 years  wow  to made a hole in the wall how he escape and become a person he made it up for wardens dirty job how his dreams come true and lastly after 5 years in jail after andy escaped how red not decided to suicide decided to follow andy. best movie ever... 10/10maybe for me and i think most of true batman fans at first glance this isnt comic book batman that i was expecting. its marvelous how nolan succeeded to present in one movie batman that is so realistic and that we can connect to it and really be pulled into movie and that he preserves all craziness of joker that is demanded from his character. batman movie can be done in various ways and one reason is because batman and his greatest enemy have no superpowers and i see that as a good thing because then you have more space and need to present these characters not as someone who can really exist but as someone who put you more into movie and unreal world of comic book at the same time. he put this two things together in something that almost everyone would watch and like but without losing true representation of dark knight.mark my words the nolans brothers will be on the same level as the coens shortly. their films provide a dark and disturbing world into batmans persona and the illusion of the life he desires bruce wayne. simply put this film possesses every attribute a viewer looks for in a film. it has tremendous writing directing acting scenery and plot. how can you go wrong with oldman eckhart caine gyllenhaal ledger freeman and bale. a superstar cast that doesnt disappoint. i wont spoil the film for anyone but i urge all to see it. it is my own selfish need but i feel robbed that cinema will never again see such a disturbing and entertaining character personified in ledgers performance. rip...many went into this film with high expectations and hype that was unprecedented much like the somewhat disappointing godzilla 2014 from earlier this year not many knew what to expect with this film considering that the guardians of the galaxy were for the most part unheard of characters to the general public this film did not disappoint in any way it is by far the greatest marvel film ever made downing the avengers and days of future past i went into this movie with a feeling that i dont usually get with a film i knew that this was going to be different and good at the same given time and i was not let down from the very opening scene to the ending credits there was not even a second of boredom to say that this film was entertaining would be putting it under the bus this film was exhilarating never have i seen a film that grasped my attention and kept me in awe from start to finish as for the technical aspects this film has the best cgi i have ever seen not once did the animation look even relatively fake or cheesy the cgi will probably revolutionize the field much like 2009s avatar i felt as though i could reach out and touch these alien creatures and the amazingly designed ships the  of the film was beautiful as was the cinematography there were emotional scenes that were played so well with the  that it was as if they were interchangeable parts that had to be together to work in unison every shot of this film was gorgeous and breathtaking i saw so many things that i have never seen in a film before and for them to capture it so crisply is truly astounding the acting was very well done by all of the cast members there may not be any oscar buzz for the cast but that doesnt mean that they werent perfect for their roles chris pratt was genius as star lord bautista was hilarious as drax the destroyer and bradley cooper and vin diesel did great jobs for voice acting both being highlights for the film as far as writing this movie did something truly unique it focused on all of the guardians with equal screen time and equal information of their lives though star lord may have a bit more for obvious reasons all of the personalities of the main characters were written so well that i forgot for a period of time that it was even a movie the humor is not dirty for the most part and is not slap stick and tiresome every scene with humor did its job to make the whole crowd in the theater laugh hysterically the dialogue was simply that well written every aspect of this film was great obviously it isnt a perfect film but it manages to do something that directors have forgotten about it entertains the audience and that is the sole purpose of the entire film films now rely so heavily on art and the directors ideas of uniqueness that most films are only appreciated by certain groups guardians of the galaxy is a film that anyone can watch and they will enjoy themselves from start to finish and never want to leave the theater while watching this movie at the opening friday i couldnt help but think to myself over and over again that this is the next star wars it has the same chemistry and formula but in my own opinion it exceeds the original star wars it is an updated and modern form of that film technique of pure entertainment mixed with humor and character development that adults can relate to as well it is rare that i say this but this film will make you cry make you laugh make you excited make you fearful etc it is every genre and yet no genre guardians is going to be a staple in film and will one day be considered one of the greatest sci fi films ever james gunn was the director of one of the worst films of 2013 in movie 43 but he has proved that he is one of the elite despite a horrible effort a year prior this film resurrects the original intention and purpose of film to entertain i believe it will be the next star wars and spawn many more films to comemany tarantino fans differ on what tarantinos best film was. reservoir dogs pulp fiction inglorious basterds having seen all three the opinion i submit is the majority opinion_„îpulp fiction. but why pulp fiction in my view represents something few movies can pull off. a completely pointless narrative made into an astonishingly good film. what is so good about a movie with no point its actually rather simple. pulp fiction doesnt use extensive special effects or mind-bending plot or bizarre character development. tarantino in fact wrote this one pretty much by-the-book along with co-writer roger avary. the plot is nothing unusual or never-before-seen. but its the careful eye of the artist in front of and behind the camera that makes this film such a treat. i have watched it six times already and each time the movie just gets better. each time i see something in the background that i didnt see before. i catch something someone says or see some minor backdrop detail that i didnt pick up on. however this isnt why i love pulp fiction so much. these details are not the main thing. its the complete package. when you step back and look at pulp fiction as a whole it is nothing short of a masterpiece. tarantino specifically chose 50 asa film stock to make it look older than it was. this film created a beautiful look for a movie set in the sunny hollywood heights. the music was perfect for the crime thriller part of the feel of this movie and the use of the hawthorne grill and the chevy nova were perfect selections to add to the classic feel of this movie even though its quite apparent that its set in the modern day. butch is driven to the hotel in a checker cab everything in general feels older than it really is. but what really sells it is the actors. today this wouldnt be a star-studded cast it would be a diamond-studded cast-on-platinum cast. john travolta and samuel l. jackson make perfect hit men and are crucial at the beginning of the film to setting up a surprising scene. uma thurmans small role is nevertheless appreciated and she makes the most of her screen time not only on the part of the writers but also because she has excellent delivery on her lines. at the end though i feel that jackson is the star even though there is truly no primary role here. his monologues are to die for in this movie. all in all if you have not seen pulp fiction change that.many people i know havent yet seen this film put off by the comic book aspect. batman im not really into that its for kids isnt it wrong forget the genre this is a timeless masterpiece. unlike a lot of recent superhero movies including batman begins this doesnt waste time with how they gained their powers what their backstory is a love interest distraction etc. it starts with batman and ends with batman. the film grips you from the very beginning and takes you on a mesmerising roller-coaster of tense action and drama. whilst there is a grand finale of sorts the brilliant spirit of human race boat scene you could pick 4 or 5 different scenes from the film which all could have merited any films climax. take for example the attempted shooting of the major scene batmans dilemma of who to save between harvey dent and rachel the hospital exploding etc. quite frankly the film leaves you physically exhausted. heath ledgers joker is also one of the most brutally savage badies in movie history. savage in the sense that he has no super power no physical strength of skill but has the mind of a genius. when he talks you start thinking hold up why do i want this guy to succeed its a thriller with no filla i can never pull that phrase offmany batman films have seen their day. you had adam wests comical batman portrayal to michael keatons classic performance. then comes the embarrassing stages of the batman franchise. batman forever which was decent. then the terrible batman & robin which was terrible. then you have the great batman begins. then there is this masterpiece. the characters are spot on. heath ledger is a great joker. aaron eckharts performance as harvey dent blows tommy lee jones role as the same character in batman forever away. maggie gyllenhaal michael caine and morgan freeman are always great. and christian bale proves to be the best batman yet. graphics are great acting is great great plot and a great movie.man all the movies this guy had made is just great he is simply a mastermind this movie had great actors great story and well u can say that everything is just perfect ultra highly recommended movie a must seemaleficent starring angelina jolie takes a new view on the sleeping beauty story from the life of maleficent the fairy this is much like the musical wicked which tells the story of the wizard of oz from the life of the wicked witch everything about this movie just screamed awesome the special effects the cinematography and the acting were all spot on the magical forest home to maleficent and all of the magical creatures almost the entire forest was computer generated but it looked as real as ever the detail that was put into the creatures of the forest was incredible they didnt cut any corners when making this movie even with the smallest of fairies you could still see every wrinkle every smile and every movement clear as day and watching as maleficent soars across the water and watching it ripple or as she flies through the sky breaking through clouds was nothing less than breath taking everything in this film looked as real as anything ive ever seen the camera angles and lighting were also just as superb everything just seemed natural it didnt like i was even watching a movie more that i was actually experiencing everything that was happening the lighting for the movie was great when it was bright it wasnt too bright and when it was dark it wasnt pitch black but the low light scenes are what really got me in the castle where most of the low lighting scenes took place the amber lights from the torches never clashed with the casting lights and blended right in and when maleficents forest was dark they added soothing yet eerie purple orbs of light all over the place to give the scene an ominous but peaceful feel the acting was as spot on as the rest of the movie angelina jolie was truly born to play the role of maleficent she was sweet and kind but strong and vengeful while still keeping her wisdom and she wasnt the only amazing actor copley played a proud but paranoid king who will stop at nothing to destroy maleficent fanning played an innocent and beautiful if you can get past her blonde hair and brown eyebrows but strong aurora and riley played a obedient yet free spirited diaval the crow even the small actors in this movie did an amazing job this movie is one of the best nonanimated disney movies that i believe has ever been made the acting special effects and the cinematography were just plain incredible you could really tell that the actors and the director put a lot of time into this movie and it couldnt have been any better 1010 for suremaleficent is magnificent the story is sophisticated enough to delight adult audiences with a brilliant take on the beloved tale with a delightful twist including the meaning of true love the characters are sympathetic and there is enough excitement the art direction and cinematography are beautiful the fairy land scenes resemble a pre raphaelite painting the castle was a bit generic cgi the right blend of human faces with cgi so it didnt look too animated the director stromberg who did oz the great and powerful did an even better job here angelina jolies expressive face is the perfect showcase for the character  it is the role of her lifetime like the way they did her cheekbones to make it like the disney cartoon sam riley as her sidekick morphs into many fairy tale creatures crow dragon horse the creatures are well done not awkward in movement and not overwhelming elle fanning is sweet and picture perfect for the role of aurora and brenton thwaites plays her prince the fairies including juno temple and imelda staunton are cute too liked this more than the snow white movies mirror mirror and snow white and the hunstman the first was fun but a bit silly and the second was too grim maleficent is the perfect blend of excitement and fairy tale most enjoyable film of the yearmaleficent disneys maleficent is a retelling of their 1959s sleeping beauty that was derived from charles perraults the sleeping beauty it is a beautiful movie the story is so well written the scenes are well directed and acted i will say that the 3d is not worth it if you are going to go go to the 2d because the picture is better i give maleficent 9 out of 10 stars it is a great family movie that everyone will enjoy as long as you enjoy fairy tales with a great twist from what we are used to hearing ****************spoiler alert below********************* maleficent retells the original disneys sleepy beauty it does a fantastic job at it it aids in the frozen redefining of the phrases true love and true loves kiss which i am a huge fan of linda woolverton is the writer of this version of sleeping beauty she is truly a master at finding the voice of maleficent it is based more on the life of maleficent it is written so the it rounds out and mirrors the characters of maleficent and aurora while at the same time bringing depth to all of the characters in the movie except prince phillip which is intentional when you see the movie youll see why i say this the actors do a superb job angelina jolie as top bill was phenomenal she does for maleficent what margaret hamilton did for the wicked witch of the west she brings the character to life there are moments that steal your heart between aurora and maleficent you see maleficent harden and then you see her soften aurora is played superbly by elle fanning and a few other young girls one of the moments that will really grab your heart is between angelina jolie and her own daughter playing aurora at a very young age it is a moment of truthfulness between the characters imelda staunton leads the three fairies that are to take care of aurora there are really great moments there sharlto copley plays the infamous stefan just as he was a fantastic psycho baddie in elysium he is so in maleficent he masterfully shows a plunge into a psychotic king that is paranoid of losing his own life sometimes seemingly over that of his daughter as far as directing and the cinematography go this is top notch this is robert strombergs directing debut and he really shows off his chops as well as the cinematography work of dean semler i hope to see these two team up again the picturing and mise en scene is perfect there are moments of close ups and the scene filled with other characters that just take you by surprise and make your heart melt the hits that i really have for you are the moments where actors jolie and copley slip in and out of their accents copley has moments where he attempts an irish accent and it is a wee bit disastrous see what i did there the greatest moments are when he accepts his southern african accent and just goes for it in the last moments of the film they have prince phillip and he really isnt needed in that scene hes used as a plot device earlier in the movie and the pay off is great but his reentrance into the forest isnt needed the 3d and 2d are not needed 2d in this movie is what you want to see it is brighter and has a greater sense of detail to the beautiful pictures there are moments in the 3d version where everything is just way too dark whereas in the 2d it is not there are also moments such as the dragon scene and the moores scene that couldve been outrageously beautiful but they fall completely flat on their face if i were a producer i wouldve called out the 3d editing and the last and slight hit i wouldve liked to see a green tinge to maleficentmagnificent. this is one word and it does the film the justice it deserves. its a triumph on so many fronts technical and creative or both at the same time. great story innovative and clever direction super editing high quality acting stirring soundtrack composition nigh on flawless special effects well drilled stunt performers wonderfully authentic prop design. hell i could go on all day there are so many elements here that are excellent i find it hard to spot and point out the flaws. maybe as well the fact that the film has left me speechless on three occasions. fundamentally though one could strip away the fantasy elements the huge battles and dazzling effects and youd still be left with a fine film. why well because the themes it deals with are so affecting and beautifully written and acted that there would still be a gripping humane drama to play out. the corrupting lure of power against the strength of friendship. as the ring takes hold of frodo he could be lost to the evil that has taken the pitiable smeagol but through courage and willpower from both himself and sam his character triumphs. it is to the credit of elijah wood and sean astin that they convey this spirit so well on screen. it is also to the credit of andy serkis and the nice chaps at weta digital that smeagol/gollum is so compelling. he must be one of the most complexly deceptive characters to have ever been written about. sweet and innocent but brutally cold and calculating. a true enigma of a person. this couldve gone wrong but we are at once disgusted and pitying of gollum frightened by his treachery but understanding of frodos continued trust in him. he is the dark heart of the film. the other cast members also do fine job bringing the heart and emotion of tolkiens text to the screen. there is tragedy and heroism in equal measure through to the films lump in throat climax. when you have these elements welded to some of the most stirring and powerful battle sequences put to celluloid picture thousands of horse riding warriors riding to battle tens of thousands of orcs and assorted monsters then you have a genuine classic. i can safely say this film will be loved for years to come and will sit well next to the likes of casablanca. ten out of ten. i would give it more if that were possibleloved this movie..im a big fan of heath ledger from his 10 things i hate about you days and will always and forever remain a fan of his acting the plot was great every actor/actress were phenomenal..especially maggie g. as rachel. so yeah maybe the batman didnt have to make his voice so deep but he definitely had to change it to separate himself from bruce wayne..i thought it was fitting. so..to the poster mozared below me to answer your questions why did dent turn bad and why didnt he kill the joker when he had the chance...dent believed in fairness his entire life thats what he lived by...when things started to become unfair in his eyes such as his love being killed and his current predicament to him the only fairness that was left is flipping his coin. when he flipped it with the joker he landed on heads..the joker lives same with maroni in the car scene and ramirez. even if it causes chaos like when you stated...him turning bad. the joker as well convinces him that chaos is fair as well as convincing him hethe joker was locked up at the time so dent needs to go after the people who actually put him and rachel in the warehouse. it was fairness in a sick way if you will. basically dent is just like batman..he has rules he lives by. we all know what batmans was and dents rule was fairness. now why does the joker have so many loyal men well its simple these men arent working with a full stack of cards and actually in the original series his men came from an asylum called akhram...crazies bi-polar schizophrenics you name it. he was able to lure them to do bad things for him it wouldnt be that hard when theyre not well to begin with...as you saw with the guy dent interrogated in the alley..batman explained the joker feeds off these men. and lastly why is the joker able to get around with explosives and no one noticing him....well he has too many people working for him that he bribes with money as we saw and you definitely dont think he set those traps up himself do you plus theyre cheap.loved this movie the special effects were amazing and the acting was excellent especially matthew mcconaughey and jessica chastain hanz zimmer also did a tremendous job as always the  was mesmerizingi really enjoyed this movie and if your a scifi you will enjoy on some level this is a good movie i thought it was great but that is just my opinion some may say it is good or just okay but if you love movies and enjoy good stories that connect on an emotional level this is one such movie all i have left to say is dont listen to other reviewers go make your own opinions about the film please lastly i saw it in regular format and it was still impressive and im sure it is beautiful in imax but if you dont want to see it in imax you wont miss out on anythinglove them all. great movie and story action magic and drama. the cast as they have been all the way are excellent.i am a massive fan of the first two films - i loved them.frodo baggins and sam continue their quest to destroy the ring led by the untrustworthy gollum. meanwhile the rest of the fellowship prepare for another battle to hold a human city against an onslaught of orc.peter jackson has done it. he has created an all-encompassing epic saga of tolkiens lord of the rings books and after coming away from the final chapter ive never seen a series like this. i must say that the lord of the rings is an amazingly powerful visual experience.as a film though this is amazing. a true lasting legacy in story telling and now cinema. bravo mr. jacksonlotr: return of the king is an amazing movie. i saw the trilogy on december 16th and was very impressed. it was all that i expected and more. obviously a must see but i think it was just that much better because i got to see all 3 one after the other. hats off to mr. peter jackson for a great interpretation of j.r.r. tolkiens masterpiece.lotr 3 is one of the best movies ever made and all the oscars it got were completely well deserved in fact i would add a couple. viggo mortensen ian mckellen and bernard hill all deserved a best actor nomination. and i would also mention sean bean whos performance of boromir in the first part was completely underrated it was a great performance and i cant believe he wasnt nominated i am usually a big fan of the books. ive noticed that some people complain about peter jackson completely changing the dialog and some scenes. its true. he did do that but i think its actually better this way. dont get me wrong the books are magical. its just that certain scenes and dialog would look and sound dull when seen on movies. peter jackson knew it and he had to make a certain changes. im glad he did visuals are revolutionary for the time and great for today writing is great directing is great acting is great cinematography is great make up is great costimography is great fighting choreography is great... and so on... and so on... all in all this movie is just brilliant one of the best movies ever to be made and definitely the best movie in its genre. deserves all the awards and all the hype it got a true masterpiecelord of the rings: the return of the king. is an historic epic film in the modern age of hollywood. the storyline is very well done. the cinematography by annie collins and jamie selkirk was breathe taking. director peter jackson and frances walsh has inspired young movie makers for the generations. great story and screenplay. four stars. byron warelord of the rings: the return of the king is no doubt the best movie ive seen. the film captures you instantly up to the words the end appearing on the screen. the return of the king is nothing short of excitement. for all those who doesnt know what the lord of the rings is about im thinking everybody does either through the books or the movies heres a brief summary: just over 50 year ago j.r.r. tolkien published a tale about a long dangerous quest to destroy 1 ring. this tale is split into 3 novels the fellowship of the rings the two towers and the return of the king. this tale is called the lord of the rings. nearly 50 years after the novels were published peter jackson tells the tale in another way by bringing it to life onto the big screen. this tale is about 9 peoples quest to destroy one magic ring and return peace to middle-earth. if this one ring goes back to its maker the evil sauron the world will be under his control bringing death and misery everywhere. the only way to destroy this powerful ring is to cast it into the fires of mount doom where it was made. only one hobbit could resist the temptation to keep the ring and this job was given to a hobbit named frodo baggins. to help him along the way a fellowship of nine people were brought together. in it was a wizard 2 men an elf a dwarf and three other hobbits. together they set out for mordor where mount doom is situated. getting to mordor is not as easy as it sounds. on the way theyll have to battle orcs uruk-hais giant spiders and other results of tolkiens fascinating imagination. the return of the king is the last addition to this vast trilogy. peter jackson does a great job in interpreting tolkiens thoughts and feelings into a film. watching the movies is just like reading the books themselves. if it was only the movies it wouldnt have made such an impact on the public. the music in all three films practically takes you on your very own journey and the acting from the actors was also very impressive. if anything was missing from these movies they just wouldnt have been such a success. peter jackson has done this to perfection. overall this is a must-watch movie. plenty of action and special effects not to mention a very heart warming ending to the trilogy. ill just say one more thing dont criticise anything until you have saw heard or done it especially lord of the rings.lord of the rings: return of the king is the third film in the film trilogy the lord of the rings. it was released in december 2003 one year after the second film in this trilogy the two towers. aspects like light and colour camera work and editing will be discussed and to sum everything up the conclusion will give a final verdict. in the third and final part of the lord of the ring sam frodo and gollum continue their trip to mordor to destroy the one ring. at the same time aragorn gandalf and the remaining fellowship find out that sauron is about to attack the city minas tirith. they try to gather a human army to battle. then gandalf finds out that denethor the steward of gondor is mad with grief because of his son boromir who died in the first film. gandalf therefore leads the human army to give them a chance of winning the final battle. aragorn finds personal motivation to win the battle as when sauron is getting stronger his love arwen is dying. to save her he must reclaim the throne and lead the human army against sauron. but even with his new army to aid frodo he still has to have the strength to destroy the ring that has enchanted him. but does he have the strength to do this the usage of light and color in this film is used particularly to accentuate the moods of various characters in the film and to immerse the viewer with the feelings felt by all characters. for instance the colors are dark when aragorn gimli and legolas visit the city of the dead and even the brightly dressed characters seem rather bleak when inside the mountain. this changes the moment aragorn whips out andurill as the saturation seems to increase slightly at the moment. especially when the eye of sauron gazes at aragorns army the harsh light and the colors bleak it may at first seem threatening but gives a feeling of hope and serenity as aragorn says: for frodo the overall lighting is quite dark and the colors particularly unsaturated with the exceptions of the happy moments of the characters. the way the cameras are used in this film is absolutely brilliant. as the director peter jackson refused to use cgi to make actors playing hobbits seem smaller compared to other actors he used optical illusions placing the hobbits further away while giving the audience the impression the actors mare standing next to each other. when it was not necessary to show the faces of both or multiple characters at the same time peter would use scale doubles for the characters whose faces werent necessary. an example of this is eowyn riding to war with merry. as they are waiting to charge on the battlefield the shots only show eowyns face with the top of merrys helmet at the bottom of the screen or merrys face with eowyns torso behind him. the cameras are angled so perfectly that you wouldnt notice this the first time but would still remain non-intrusive to the entire experience even if you were to notice it. in this film special effects play a huge role and a total 2730 of special effects were used in the lord of the rings series were used of which 1477 in return of the king. special effects are the main reasons this film has been released such a long time after the animated series as the technology was not present or too expensive to create visual effects as flying dragons or even many scenes which were filmed in front of a green screen and the dÍ©cor was later added in the studio. the biggest example of an incredibly necessary and important special effect is the by all loved smÍ©agol. the special effects help accentuate the mystical feeling you get by all the happenings that are impossible in real life. once again great care has been taken to carefully adjust the film in such a way that the film is perfect and balanced correctly. during conversations reverse-shots were occasionally used to get as much involved in the conversation as possible as you experience it as if you are actually amongst the characters and joining the conversation. whenever the action commences the average shot length decreases. this means that before the action the shots are fairly long but as the action starts to build up the shots get shorter and shorter to create the feeling of chaos and excitement. the shots are transitioned in such a way that the audience gets more curious to what will happen and what really happened since the shot are so abruptly ended/ in conclusion we have all enjoyed this great film as the plot was great and the cast perfectly chosen. the acting was of high quality and it was also the best adaptation of a book we had seen so far which cant be said about a lot of recent films. the camera-work and editing was done perfectly and the light and color was just right at every moment and the special effects were staggering. we also loved the original soundtrack as it dragged us deeper into the film making it an unforgettable journey through middle earth for us. together we came to the conclusion that this film was worth a ten out of ten and fully deserved all awards it had received.lord of the rings-the return of the king is surely the greatest movie ever made. i consider that is has the most fascinating plot ever written.the universe of the movie is unique: a fantastic world which includes almost every mythical creature we heard of. elvesorcstrollshobbitsall these make up a charming atmosphere. the idea of a ring that can submit the will of its bearer is surely unique is recalls all throughout the movie.also the love story between aragorn and the immortal arwen is the most original one seen in the entire history of movies. the fate of king debethor reminds us of greek tragedies and the film contains great moral learningsmost in the words of the wizard gandalf. the fantasy and the charming sublime atmosphere make me consider this movie the greatest work or art ever created by mankind.lord of the rings the return of the king is arguably the best movie in the history of movies. it is almost perfect if not perfect. peter jackson will go down as one of the greatest producer/director of all time. so many times we see great books series butchered on the big screen but not this time. this is 2nd best movie series of all time the only reason its not first is because star wars wasnt a book before the movies which made it a little harder to make. but if you are just looking at how well each movie was it is the best series of all time. im not gonna go into much detail because i feel like a review on here should just let the person that is reading it know if the movie is good or not. if you have seen the first 2 than get ready to be blown away. finally you get to see what happens to the ring and all the characters responsible for getting the ring to the place they can destroy it. will they get there if they do will they lose anybody else what happens trust me watch this movie along with all of your questions being answered you will also witness one of the greatest movies ever if not the greatest.like i did a few years back you might be hesitating about watching this film. the title didnt appeal to me and neither did the subject matter so it was only by chance that i started to watch it. i can only say that the film was a revelation for me and has stayed with me ever since. there are so many dark and hopeless films out there which whilst they leave an impression leave the wrong one i.e that there is no hope in life. watch this film and be uplifted and be encouraged by the message...that there is always hope....in any situation. please watch this film and the watch it again. its a great answer to all the cynicism that is out there.like a beautifully crafted french wine this movie keeps getting better and better with every passing year. every time i have viewed it over the past decade and it must be at least more than 20 times by now i have found newer shades subtler indications and deeper meanings. and it has amazed me like very few have. * no overacting * humour in the drab hopeless environs of shawshank * method in the madness of running the scams from inside * the complete secrecy maintained for 20 years not even red knew * the best that a highly-educated intellectual could do inside such a prison * what a great actor the warden turned out to be - totally despicable * what a bunch of speakable quotes.. what a bunch * totally recommended for any young person - students especially * hope truly is the best of things - a message that shines throughlets open this review with the fact that batman is the best superhero ever with no other even coming close to his levels. so when a sequel is made for an unforgettable movie like batman begins expectations are extremely high. i think that if you could describe this movie in a few words it would be 152 minutes of pure awesomeness. christopher nolan probably created the best ever comic book adaptation of a movie. the movie itself has been adapted in a much more realistic fashion than the comic book series. first of all this movie is perfect for people who like punches drama shooting and explosions. the movie has a complicated plot that keeps your eyes glued to the screen. its anything but corny since a few important characters die and the ending isnt happy but its flawless. christian bale has proved himself one again as an amazing actor. michael cane portrays alfred pennyworth makes you fall in love with batmans loyal butler. now anyone that has seen the movie and is reading this review is probably wondering why i havent mentioned the main reason why this movie is flawless. and yes there is one main reason: heath ledger. heath ledger portrayed batmans arch nemesis in this movie: the joker. now anyone who has a clue in comic books knows that the joker is incredible. heath ledgers acting in this movie has turned the joker into a legend. i have never seen such perfect and realistic acting than the portrayal of the joker in this movie. the joker is portrayed in a much more mature fashion than the comic books and thats why it was so good. its simply impossible to describe him: hes bold insane smart twisted and hes so awesome in this film that at some points you love him even more than batman. if i havent mentioned it by now this is without a doubt the best movie i have seen.those who come with high expectations after seeing batman begins will not be disappointed. i advise that no one under the age of 11 watches this movie as two-faces appearance is rather frightening and the film contains intense action.lets get straight to the point. the plot is set out to perfection. it doesnt rush itself and tells the story brilliantly. the way it elegantly portrays the jokers sick humour when threatening the 2 boats containing prisoners and citizens. not to mention the tension when one boat has to blow up the other leaves you hanging on the edge of your seat. the film also shows that batman is shown not be a unbeatable hero and has a side of realism that christopher nolan directs really well. but my favourite thing about the dark knight is the excellent acting of the late heath ledger and his role of the joker is quirky sinister and what makes the dark knight one of my favourite films of all time.lets begin by stating that this movie should only be watched in imax. if you are a big batman fanatic spend a couple extra dollars and youll get your moneys worth. this is the best movie of 2008 no other film will come close. christopher nolan has made his masterpiece with the help of his brother jonathan creating the script. the perfect balance between superhero action and drama can be found here in the dark knight. the acting is top-notch. not a single actor in this movie comes up short. christian bale portrays batman better than he did in its predecessor. aaron eckhart impresses with his take of harvey dent. maggie does a fantastic job playing the role of rachel dawes. heath ledger is oscar worthy in his attempt at the infamous batman rival the joker. ledgers performance is just absolutely stunning. no words can describe how much he attracts the viewer and shines on the big screen. there is no reason why anyone should say this movie was bad. those who gave this movie a poor rating should be ashamed of themselves for their lack of intelligence. yes i said. lack of intelligenge even if your not a batman fanatic this film has a meaning and purpose. it will give you excitement and also something to ponder about for the rest of the day night morning etc. no spoilers but its lengthy running time of 152 minutes beats the hell out of any other superhero comic book adaptation previously made and for years to come. ledgers stunning acting portrayal of the joker is good enough for you to spend the money. do not wait for it to come out on dvd watch it in imaxlet me start out by saying that this is one of my personal all time favorites and as such i may be a bit bias whole reviewing it. on the other hand theres a reason its a personal favorite. the movie revolves around the wrongly imprisonment of andy dufrane played by tim robbins for the murder of his wife. the story focuses on andys life in prison relationships with other inmates particularly with red played perfectly by morgan freeman and passion for life and freedom. i recently had an argument with one of them regarding this movie. he claimed it was too plain to be considered so great  in another story he is with his partner jules winnfield samuel l. jackson trying to transmit a message to a group of guys who owns money to marcellus wallace  in another story he only makes an appearance in which is actually the story of butch coolidge bruce willis a fighter who works marcellus wallace which after a fight which was supposed to lose he tries to flee the country with his french girlfriend fabienne maria de medeiros. many other characters form the movie mixing in stories each one with a different theme but all have something alike long dialogs. the film features unprecedented writing addresses several topics some do not have anything to do with the stories and the situations of the characters but the way they are written in a way so simple and interesting is really from a true master on writing screenplays that is quentin tarantino. despite having had help from roger avary on the screenplay this time but all the ideas are still from tarantinos mind keeping his good dark-humor and his bloody fun violence. the film with so many stories tarantino mixes the different chapters leaving them out of order. not to leave more confused but to leave the film more entertaining and extremely interesting with the insane dialogs between characters. a legendary film excellent performances perfect writing with interesting stories covering various topics and all very entertaining. undoubtedly the best tarantino film a classic and a legendary masterpiece.let me start by telling this i think this movie is the best movie ever made. there are different reasons for that conclusion and part of it certainly is due to the buildup this movie had with the first 2 other movies. i think this movie is much better than both of them though. it pretty much everything a movie needs to have imo. it has good storytelling great characters outstanding visuals and good pacing which is something i found the other 2 movies to be missing. what can be said about the story obviously is that it is giant. there are stories that take place on a smaller scale where only small things are at risk and i am not saying these stories are worse in fact if theyre done right they can be better but i also like stories that tackle a giant worldwide danger. this is what all of the lotr movies do they deal with something that threatens pretty much the entire world. the good storytelling in it is that we find different people in this situation and they all come together through some circumstances which of course happens in the first movie not this one. what we get in this movie is those characters working together to solve this one problem. they all do serve a purpose in solving the problem and the story does a good job to show why they do. that is good storytelling that is how you tell a giant story right. and also the way it ended is great. then we have the characters. we have a lot of different characters in lotr. we have people like aragorn who are in self doubt although this isnt really present in the books. i think its a great addition to the story which they manage to lose in the end and which makes them get to the peak of their power. this is what we get to see in return of the king. we finally see aragorn actively deciding that he will take his rightful throne and he does what he needs to do to deserve it. on the other hand we have characters that are like legolas the knight in shining armor kind. we do also have crazy people denethor we have people like sam who are just very loyal. what i am getting to is that those characters all seem believable to me which is what makes a good character. the best example would be frodo who also is in a constant struggle because of the ring. his story is a great story about a guy that is not big enough for the task hes up against which is a sad story. the good thing on that part is that everyone else got their happy end but frodo didnt because frodo basically failed. this characters are interesting. so lets talk about the visuals. my favorite scene of the trilogy from the cinematic standpoint is in this movie. it is when the riders of rohan attack the ork army in front of minas tirith. it is just a very beautiful scene. from an artistic standpoint it is brilliantly made. what gives this scene a lot of power is the horn that announces it. when you hear that horn you have a slight idea of what youre going to get. you get the fact that rohan is arriving but to see it play out on the screen to see them ride down those hills being bombarded by arrows and crushing through the pikes of the orks was the most beautiful thing i have ever seen on a screen. if i have ever been close to an orgasm while watching a movie it was during this scene because this scene is epic. now to the pacing. this movie does pacing in a better way than the other 2. what makes the difference is that noting in return of the king seems irrelevant to the story. yes it is long. but the length this movie has is filled up with relevant stuff and everything seems very important which is why it doesnt stretch as much as the other 2 movies do. it feels shorter although it is massively longer. this is quite an impressive thing. now those are my reason for liking this movie. i truly think that it probably isnt the best in any of the categories i mentioned but i think it combines them in the best way. the complete package of the lord of the rings: the return of the king is bigger and better than that of any other movie which makes it the best movie i have ever watched. if there was any way to give it more than 10/10 i would definitely do that but i will have to stick to a 10/10.ladys and gentleman oscar season has officially begun with gone girl and i would be shocked if it doesnt take a oscar or few especially rosamund pike holy cow she steals this movie sorry affleck your good shes great dont forget the masterful eye of david fincher ben affleck is good tyler perry is surprisingly good after those madea movies he gets this neil patrick harris is good anyone you see is good and the twists and intense is no less than great this is one of the best movies i seen in while certainly best movie so far as this year but its going to be tough to beat gone girl i got to say i did see one twist but it was only like a minute before they shown it i couldnt stop watching it i didnt want it to end and thats the only movie i ever saw to say that and i have to praise this movie for this achievement and thank you for making this movie thank youkingsman the secret service is anything but an average action film or average spy film its much more the film genuinely blew my mind because of its take on modern day action spy films the comedy tint was absolutely brilliant  if there werent as many funny scenes it still would have been good but just not as good as it was i loved it taron egerton is great in the film as the main protagonist  eggsy the film revolves around the young man who trains to become the next kingsman colin firth was the most standout character alongside taron egerton colin firth was incredible in this film  sheer fantastic acting also its good knowing that we had so many great costars in the film the likes of samuel l jackson mark strong mark hamill and michael caine woah what a fantastic cast i enjoyed everyones role but my favourite in particular was probably colin firth as galahad samuel l jackson was funny in the movie and played a rather unusual yet interesting and good villain valentine i seemingly enjoyed every single thing about the movie  the opening the soundtrack the acting the visuals the comedy the action the little scenes of romance  the whole film was outstanding and so unique i say unique as in its take is so completely different from other generic action films or the simple spy film you get now and again and yes i liked this movie better than any james bond filmwith maybe the exception of moonraker and a few others nonetheless kingsman is an unexpected comedy joyride that explores inner levels of action adventure comedy and more i hope you go and see the movie  i hope you enjoy it simply inexplicably goodkeeping the high standards set in the first two parts and upping the ante in terms of detailed action sequences and effects - but never disappearing up its own arse like those god-awful matrix sequels. this is sheer stunning edge-of-your-seat cinema that demands to be experienced on a very big screen. i appreciated the gradual coming down as this film - and the epic series - concludes. its button-pushingly emotional - but rightly so weve been through one hell of an adventure. i stayed to listen to annie lennox sing and to view the names of all the cast and crew whove done their very best to make this tale a reality. they deserve utmost praise and sincere gratitude. kudos too to christopher lee - who may not have made the initial theatre-release cut but who was none the less there in spirit. im hoping the extended dvd will include his contributions.keeping in mind that the two previous movies are really all meant as a complete picture i can truely say that this is a masterpiece. like the books that the movies are based on the movies are not always perfect in a traditional movie sense nor do they confine themselves to traditional filmaking. i have read the books three times now and yet pj and his team has manaaged to keep me on the edge of my seat and feel anxious when the characters or in peril... i do know certain aspects were left out including sauraman and the love blossoming between faramir and eowyn. with that said though pj made sure he did the theatrical version true to the books in the sense that we are never torn from the main characters of this story. i do have to say however that the real test will come when we have all three extended cuts of these movies and watch them in a marathon of 12 hours and watch them flow into one another. i cant wait 10/10  this movie has it all. if you love a movie that energizes all of your senses then check this one out. this truly is american film making at its finest. just watched richard linklaters film boyhood a picture that was shot over 12 years and its done so great as the viewer sees the main character masonin a super performance from ellar coltrane change and grow up over that period on screen as time changes things and people it starts in texas with young masoncoltraneat the age of 5 and hes your typical little cute boy with an older sister and its typical with the problems of life his mom and dadpatricia arquette and ethan hawkeare divorced and thru the film its a tale of journey and change as soon masons mom gets married and divorced again while becoming a teacher and even dad marries and becomes a father again and the change of address is common for mason and his sister during it all a young man discovers life is about pain like and dislike with trips family and birthdays as age and time changes it all one finds out about life thru time age and change overall beautiful film one of time and coming of age while learning life and discovery is so common with time and changejust like the two previous this one explores a action packed adventure/fantasy world with a extremely well crafted story line thanks to jrr tolkien books. not every adaptation from book to movie lives up to the hype but lets just say this one is relatively close. if tolkien was alive today i think he would certainly be pleased about the outcome of this brilliant trilogy. this movie has all the right elements andis a boys dream and the entertainment value makes this move next to perfect for its genre. i dont need to brag the movie speaks for it self. eleven oscars is all time record high and only two other movies has reached that benchmark. this is a true adventure classic and i truly envy those who have not yet seen this remarkable movie they have a amazing movie experience awaiting them. enjoy 9.3/10just and outstanding film really good plot great action the type of film you want to sit in to watch with your mates or girlfriend i just cant say it enough holy f*** i love this freaking film just love the way colin firth portrayed harry in the comics and samuel l jackson made it better by just showing up in the film as well as mark hamill with a surprising entrance so this makes me want to go and see the star wars film more hahahaha overall the kingsman is and outstanding film and i cant wait for the sequel i just love the work of matthew vaughn like kick ass for examplejohn travolta got all the press but its samuel jackson who provides the snap crackle & popjohn travolta & samuel l jackson at their best four stories one great film the small time robbers tim roth & amanda plummer the gangsters john travolta & samuel l jackson the gangsters wife uma thurman the boxer bruce willis & ving rhames in my opinion quentin tarantinos best film you will need to watch this movie more than once to truly appreciate just how good it is you will see something new each time you watch it the dialogue is natural convincing and witty there are so many great characters in this film it difficult to pick any one the main characters in all four stories give excellent performances but so do the supporting characters such as the drug dealer and his girlfriend the shop owner and police officer harvey keitel as the wolf christopher walken as captain koonsj. r. r. tolkien was one of my first fantasy writers that i have ever read. i have read this book many times so when this film came out it was like a birthday present to me. the 1978 animated lord of the rings at least gave me something to visualize but with peter jacksons version i felt like dorothy waking up in the land of oz for the first time. the filming was great even with all of the cgi content. great actors will make this film a long-time favorite for fans of the books and those who have only seen the films. a great movie has details and in the return of the king you can appreciate the details and history that is brought out by the characters in their words and actions. i absolutely love the scene when the witch king is defeated i remember the audience in the theater cheering when this took place. even at the end when the hobbits are honored it still brings a tear to my eyes. i have watched these movies over 100 times already and i am always ready to watch it again. i use these three films every time we play games as background music.  the serious violence of american gangster movies crime movies and films noise mixed up with the wacky violence of cartoons video games and japanese animation  and the fragmented story-telling structures of such experimental classics as citizen kane rashomon and la joete. the oscar-winning script by tarantino and roger avary intertwines three stories featuring samuel l. jackson and john travolta in the role that single-handedly reignited his career as hit men who have philosophical interchanges on such topics as the french names for american fast food products  bruce willis as a boxer out of a 1940s b-movie  and such other stalwarts as harvey keitel tim roth christopher walken eric stoltz ving rhames and uma thurman whose dance sequence with travolta proved an instant classic. ive watched this film several times and i really enjoy it i think films wouldnt be the same nowadays without tarantino i fell in love with tarantino with this film and i started watching all of his works including the films that werent directed by him this is his best motion picture and its one of those films that you just cant miss like the godfather or irrÍ©versible or a clockwork orange or the shining you may say it sounds stupid but to me this film has the soul of the western ones you can see in it all the references of the best pictures ever made it has great violence the good one the one that tarantino talks about when he says that movies were made to violence and nothing elseive watched this about 20 times now and im captivated from start to finish every time. its a gripping emotionally draining and exciting film. id go far to say that it is the greatest film of all time. along with the best trilogy of all time. this film set a new standard in film making and jackson is probably the most sort after director going thanks to this movie. you have to really watch the last film as it starts straight after the last one had finished. frodos task is hanging on a knife edge has he starts to lose strength and his trust in gollum grows to strong. andy serkis and weta do an absolutely fantastic job of gollum once again. he looks extremely realistic once again and really plays a big part in the film. i thought the expansive scenery and battles added to the brilliance and build up towards the end. in particular the battle of pelannor fields just left me jaw-dropped at how brilliant it was filmed. some of the huge backdrops played a big part also i.e. the part where gandalf finally sees minis tirith. you feel very involved throughout the film with frodos quest. jackson creates the sense of pity fantastically on the viewer regarding gollum. the only issue i have was jackson did squeeze to many endings together making them feel a lot less emotional on the viewer. i thought it was awfully sad when frodo passed into the west and they should of just left it at that however it was a lot to cram in and i think 3 hours of film was absolutely masterful. its hard to review a film with so many qualities and very few faults. if you look at professional critics they will agree at how good this film is 11 oscars well done and more awards. the most solid 10/10 ive ever given.ive watched all films that tarantino directed but for me this pulp fiction is the best of all of them its a little bit difficult to explain this movie this looks like a omnibus and consists of prologue  three stories and epiloguethey seem to be disconnected but after watching everything is connected prologue is about a couple planning to burgle a restaurant and two man from mafia vincent and jules  they takes a order from their boss marsellus to collect his possessions first story is about vincent and marselluss wife vega he is asked to take care of her by marsellus second is about one boxer who refuses to order to lose on purpose third is about vincent and jules again they happen to kill a man and asks a professional to solve epilogue is also them at a restaurant if theres a word describes this movie it must be crazy in a good sense all of the stories are completely crazy full of sex talks and violence and theres no message from this however i do love this craziness i have to admit that tarantino really has a great sense of humor and is good at creating wonderful characters particularly i like jules acted by samuel jackson im fascinated by his way of speak and the scene he recites ezekiel 25:17 its imprinted on my mind also i think conversations of this movie are really amusing theyre meaningless and not important but for instance one about hamburger is awesome every time after watching i come to want to eat a hamburger the story i like most is second the scene bruce willis and ving rhames get caught and they kick asses of stupid two young guys is amazing this is a cheap b movie but its waste to miss this sophisticated story  direction like music and enjoyable acting after watching you may feel refreshing and have a desire to watch againive seen this film on imdb so many times before on so many peoples lists. but i just ignored it because i thought it was not what i was looking for. when i finally decided to see it i immediately regretted not watching it any sooner. the film is heartbreaking and frustrating from the start but in the end you would truly feel redemption. you could feel the pain and injustice brought upon andy the protagonist. as i watched the movie i felt as if i was in prison with him  we get guy ritchie and jeremy clarkson. travolta and samuel l jackson play vincent and jules a couple of bantering hit men working for marsellus ving rhames who is highly protective of his wife mia uma thurman and about to conclude a payday from a fixed boxing match  marselluss fighter butch bruce willis is haunted by a childhood encounter with his late fathers best friend a jaw-dropping cameo from christopher walken. everyones destiny plays out with that of a couple of freaky stick-up artists played by amanda plummer and tim roth. in 1994 all the talk was of former video-store clerk tarantinos indifference to traditional culture. that patronised his sophisticated cinephilia and in fact 20 years on the writerly influences of edward bunker elmore leonard and jim thompson seem very prominent. don delillo began the 90s by warning that the us is the only country in the world with funny violence. maybe pulp fiction was the kind of thing he had in mind. unmissable.ive seen this film many times before  and every time i watch it it just seems to get better there really is nothing bad i have to say about this film  because the overlying message of the film is infinite  and its just such a timeless classic . i cant imagine the movie without tim robbins and morgan freeman in their respective roles so bravo to them  because ultimately these two characters are the heart of the story. while there are some scenes that truly stand out to me  you just need to do yourself a favour a watch this amazing film. its one of the best of all time and i can promise you that you will enjoy it ive seen the dark knight many times. once you start watching it you just cant stop. -batman begins was the perfect change for the usual batman - atmosphere. - -it was easy for us to accept things in the dark knight because of the first movie. -the dark knight was the best of the trilogy because of heath ledger. -the dark knight rises was surely one of the best movies in 2012. but honestly without the dark knight the trilogy wouldnt have been nearly as popular as it is now. also christopher nolans name suddenly is all over the planet.ive seen a lot of movies in my day and a lot i have said are the best ever but pulp fiction has to be the best the way this movie depicts the world of la crime is like no other ever will the unique way the stories are told will never be matched the way scares the heck out of you so fast then makes you burst out in laughter is awesome the way tarentino built up the characters it felt like you knew all them personally and finally the cast the cast was absolutely perfect for this movie  i mean who else could have played jules except samuel l in conclusion see pulp fiction it will be like no other movie youve ever seen if you are worried about the language it fits in with the movie so when you think about it its not really that bad ive read a lot of the comments here. ive never voted for this movie once but now im going to give it what it deserves. and i am going to try to describe why a lot of shawshank fans are voting this the best movie ever. the reasons that this movie is great are: it has incredible acting incredible story-telling incredible pace incredible writing and dialogue incredible imagery and an incredible twist and ending. the godfather also has these qualities. but the reason shawshank is better is because it literally is potentially life-changing. people watch shawshank and someone truly may believe in hope. they may truly believe their lives will get better. they may truly believe others lives can be made better. its message is not only told but it is felt and oft times absorbed. for men for women for old for young for everyone. it is a masterpiece. what other movie affects people in this way you dont get that with the godfather. gf is a great film but you just come out of it saying wow that was one of the best films ive ever seen. with shawshank you say more than that. you feel more than that. you will never see another like it. and the mere perfection of this movie by a novice director will frustrate experienced and future directors forever.  its an epic in the class of the ten commandments or gone with the wind but with lots more fighting. and what fighting it is the combat scenes capture the full intensity and brutality of medieval warfare of pounding clubs and maces bodies impaled with spears and arrows or crushed beneath catapult stones within the bounds of pg-13. yet theres also is the precision even beauty of aragorns swordsmanship and legeloss skill with the bow their ability to fell an enemy with every swing of the sword or release of an arrow. and then theres the sheer scale of it all. the climactic battle of pelenor fields is the largest ever filmed with dozens of siege engines more than two-hundred thousand orcs and a charge by six thousand horsemen. there are few sights that can surpass six thousand armored cavalrymen at full charge but a counter charge by a line of mumukhiel is surely one of them. add the piercing shrieks of fell beasts and an army of vengeful dead and you have perhaps the greatest spectacle ever to grace the screen. this may seem hyperbole or even heretical but cecil b. demile has nothing on peter jackson. im also highly impressed with the effects and technical aspects of this movie. the set pieces are among the largest and grandest ive seen and the models have a nearly unprecedented attention to detail. and there are thousands of weapons orc masks and suits of armor all beautifully _„_ or gruesomely- done. few projects can equal this one in the costume and make-up departments. new zealands weta workshop might just be the new industrial light and magic. now obviously all this was already present in the original version. so you may ask if this new version is worth paying to see especially if you already have the original. my answer: absolutely. theres more humor exemplified by a side-splitting drinking contest and more character development especially with faramir and denathor. and theres lots more action including gandalfs encounter with the witch king a longer fight scene with gollum and far more material with the dead men of dun-harrow. jackson has also included important vignettes from the book like the house of healing scene and negotiations with the mouth of sauron. and i particularly enjoyed christopher lees death scene near the beginning. bottom line lord of the rings return of the king is one of the grandest most exciting and most inspiring movies youll ever witness. try as i might i can find no fault with it. you owe it to yourself to see this movie especially in its new and improved state. ive never seen a series like this. a trilogy of movies created with such love and care and utter perfection of craft that you cant help but walk away and wonder how did peter jackson make this possible i have always loved the original star wars and indiana jones series for their epic storytelling and just for just fitting in as a great moment in cinema. this should be will be remembered with as much revered fondness for generations to come. they do not make films like these anymore. as a stand alone film it picks up immediately where two towers ends so brush up before seeing it. ive read the books and the anticipation of seeing some of the more profound moments in this film made me kind of view it with a rushed sense of perspective. i wanted to make sure everything in this film was done right. and when it happened it was. i will need to see this again to enjoy everything on a more casual level. the cast comes through once more. the musical  retains its beauty elegance and power. the special effects notably gollum again are nothing less than breathtaking and simply move the story along. the battles are monumentally huge and exciting. there are some liberties taken with the story especially during the end with the homecoming and yet everything that needed to be covered regarding the main characters was handled. after the greatest moment of the series resolves itself the story provided a breather. and gives a good-bye to friends seen on screen for the last three years. it was truly a bittersweet feeling in realizing that there will be no rings movie in 2004. i will miss this talented group of actors. as with the first two the film is very long but goes by without you ever truly realizing it. this film is so much more than a simple fantasy epic. its a story about strength of character friendship loyalty and love. and while every member of the fellowship has their part to play i finally understood why some critics have said this series is a story about sam. its his unwavering resolve that led the quest to its victory. sean astin is a true credit for adding the inspirational heart to this epic. as as far as the ending goes they ended it the way that it had to be ended. jackson ended this film the way it should have been. i will miss looking forward to a new rings movie but these movies provide hope that high-quality films can still be made without special effects taking over a story bathroom humor or a top 40 soundtrack. george lucas could learn a lot from these films about how not to alienate the fan base. each film has earned a 10 from me for the last two years which for me to give is a rarity. this one however is as equally deserving as its two predecessors. the academy had better not look over this film for best picture of 2003. to do so would be greatly disrespectful of the craft and care that anyone involved with these films put into them.ive never seen a series like this. a trilogy of movies created with such love and care and utter perfection of craft that you cant help but walk away and wonder how did peter jackson make this possible i have always loved the original star wars and indiana jones series for their epic storytelling and just for just fitting in as a great moment in cinema. this should be will be remembered with as much revered fondness for generations to come. they do not make films like these anymore. as a stand alone film it picks up immediately where two

wanted to make sure everything in this film was done right. and when it happened it was. i will need to see this again to enjoy everything on a more casual level.ive never really been a major fan of superhero films they all seem too similar and they generally get boring after a while but batman: dark knight stunned me. fantastic acting- particularly from heath ledger r.i.p. and christian bale- made the film thrilling and suspenseful. the storyline setting and props where spot on and really made gotham city seem as realistic as possible. the film was also quote galore with the joker adding an utterly menacing atmosphere to the film. in terms of character development harvey dent was portrayed brilliantly originally being an authoritative policing figure who ultimately ended up as two-face a wreckless broken-hearted villain. the ending was also thrilling leaving it open and adding an air of mystery as to what was going to happen next with the final showdown also hinting at another batman film. however batman: dark knight rises was a great film but batman: dark knight is the better of the two. a must see filmive just been to see a preview screening of the dark knight. now im no film reviewer/critic/whatever but this film blew me away. blah blah blah on all the performances they were brilliant heath ledger is a truly psychotic joker as one of his final performances he will be remembered as a villain who thrived on kaos and mayhem. maggie gyllenhall christain bale gary oldman michael caine morgan freeman and aaron erkhart all gave such oomph to their roles. technically the movie was fantastic. with all the explosions you expect and the body count wasnt too high. may be a little too much for children under 13 to grasp. go see it. go on buy your tickets nowive heard of this movie before i saw it to be honest not a single disagree on the perfectness of the actors or the production or the story or the dialogue man when i saw it i agreed and supported it to the last very minute its one of the best movies i ever watched and it really deserve to the 1st top movie in the american cinemas history ... id like to thank all the people who worked in or share in it i give it up for their great effort that will last in every ones memory for his life time. im sorry for my weak expression as i am impressed and my words may fail me i did my best to deliver what i think. hope to see new production with this kind of quality and this kind of mastering in every single detail.ive decided that there are two types of people in this world: people who get pulp fiction and people who dont i feel very sorry for the people who dont this is one of the funniest most enjoyable two hours ive ever spent in a theater i went into it halfway expecting not to like it and i came out a rabid fan samuel l jackson is the finest actor in film today and this movie is responsible for putting him on the map not to mention jump-starting the career of john travolta sure theres lots of violence and profanity--but thats what makes the movie im not one of those die-hard tarantino fans either i hated reservoir dogs ugh my other favorite movie along with this one is when harry met sally hows that for diversity i dont understand how anyone could not like this movie its been imitated many times since but when it came out it was very different than anything else that had been done if you find it hard to follow the first time watch it again youll understand the back-and-forth-in-time concept then every performance in it was great--and it has many lines that will be quoted for years to come i couldve done without ving rhames rape scene but other than that it was perfect 5 out of 5 starsive always been a fan of the batman legacy and when the hype was going around about batman begins and a fresh start for the caped crusader since tim burtons movies i was looking forward to the movie. but at the movies ending a sequel was guaranteed. when i went to see the dark knight on the day of its release i thought it was brilliant a great sequel christopher nolan did an amazing job once again. christian bale was excellent as bruce wayne/batman again aaron eckhart was also brilliant as harvey dent/two-face he made that part his own and pulled off the good guy district attorney role brilliant and he pulled off the evil coin flipping two-face brilliant also so i can only applaud aaron on a brilliant performance. the person who stole the show was the late heath ledger as the joker. when it was announced that heath was to portray the clown prince everyone was unsure on nolans choice of actor including myself. but heath proved everyone wrong he did a brilliant job as the joker. with jack nicholsons unforgettable performance in the jokers first big screen appearance to compete with and no doubt nicholson is a superb actor a true legend. but as much as nicholson did a good job as the joker heath ledgers performance puts nicholsons in the shadows. to change the character from nicholsons joke filled funny man persona to ledgers sick twisted psychopathic persona was brilliant and the actor pulled it off brilliant. the way he captured the insane clown personality was perfect the character was brilliant taken away from your normal villain who robs banks for money trying to take over the world blah blah blah... but ledgers joker was the villain who if he had the money hed burn it like in the movie he dont care for world domination jokers only interest was to as michael caines alfred line goes some men want to watch the world burn which is what joker wanted he dont care for anything or anybody not even himself. which was genius his performance as the joker will go down in history as one of the best and will not be forgot for a long time. as for the rumours going around on the net on threads saying nolan should cast the joker character in a 3rd batman movie if there will be a 3rd i think they shouldnt cast another joker even though the joker wasnt killed off at the end of the dark knight they shouldnt re-cast a joker for a 3rd because i dont think that any actor in the business can fill ledgers boots as joker. even though there are some brilliant actors out there they should introduce new villains for a 3rd and let the superb performance heath ledger gave us be remembered for what it was... excellent and just adding ive read some threads and rumours surrounding a 3rd movie about philip seymour hoffman as penguin and johnny depp as riddler for one hoffman is a brilliant actor and would be brilliant in the part. depp dont need my praise his work speaks for itself the man is amazing. so id give the nod to those two for those roles but the rumours around about a possible return for eckharts character dent/two-face would be good too with eckhart still playing the role but if they keep eckhart as two-face they should cast another villain and not cramp it up with too many characters like spider man 3 did which was poor. anyway brilliant movie amazing work from nolan brilliant performances from the cast mainly ledger and heres to a 3rd movie. rest in peace heath ledgerive already mentioned that david fincher is one of my favorite directors and i think that next to christopher nolan are both of my favorites of the moment when i learned that gone girl would be the new finchers movie without reading the eponymous novel by gillian flynn i hitch with want to see you because he called me much attention to the kind of story that was because it is not just a suspected murder and i think its a movie that although many will say is to see it once because the surprise no longer exist in a second chance i personally did not see it couldnt praise fincher is one of the most known to the hour of handle stories with murders and this is no exception go way to adapt the great novel of flynn perhaps even so is still the movie without that fincher or is in the hands of another director would suffer less than any other of its repertoire even so it seems to me the task of effective fincher with the staging and on with the address in general perhaps it is not looks with the camera as it has done for zodiac 2007 perhaps not his best film but the best directed by him although raises too much the first material of which it has at its disposal in that area has not gone girl dodging decadence notorious or much less ben affleck and rosamund pike is look as ever especially the first because in my opinion never before vi as sober and speaking of pike an oscar nomination does not surprise me at all in conclusion with this the best performance for both since fincher worked with two actors who in their past does not have to wide acclaim beyond the indent shared of ben affleck and matt damon in good will hunting 1997 which led them to be crowned as the statuette for best original screenplay oscar however lucidity for both and i think more of pikes side that at times she steals the movie with her interpretation together with its director it seems that things are made easier too besides fincher makes affleck seems like a good actor with his interpretation of nick dunne but nor is it to diminish the afflecks interpretation because it is clear that this time he made it gone girl develops in any moment things with calm and does not reach to sacrificing too much that is why the surprises are functional and integrated into the story in an extraordinary way work on the creation of atmosphere is another of the strengths of the film as is worth by moments of a purely environmental music accurate and full of mystery really what works wonderfully and helps a lot with the burden of suspense that we all want to see perhaps many leave surprised after the outcome because it is not for less however many criticize its particular end which in my opinion it is just perfect in fact there is a great honor to everything that has been the whole movie i am not sure to say that gone girl is the best of fincher because i have in the head seven 1995 andor the fight club 1999 but what if i am sure of is that so far is the best of the year and could not be otherwise with fincherits what you called showing in a culture or rather re emphasising a culture its an important film and no doubt one of the most important ones to have come in the last 20 years not many films threatened to change the rules of the game as this film did in terms of writing its non-linear now non-linear in the real sense it does not have a proper line of scenes or proper interpretation either but they are connected by characters this film has some iconic scenes which you will never forget like that adrenalin shot scene to mia uma thurman or reciting bibles eziekel 25:17 by jules samuel jackson though its nearly 2 and hours its not long and seems short as they are many questions unanswered so is vincent dead or not what is there in that briefcase to marseilles and these are left unanswered with just 7 scenes you make a 2 and half hour movie that redefines in its own way the perspective of the audience so i am amazed more than anything even as i watch it for nearly 10th time and the surprise keeps coming each time i see this there is something that always works in pulp fiction but what makes this film work is its writing its writing like madness there is no proper thing called this is it it can be referred to anything and you may be right the righteous man and the evil man interpretation is just a tiny example that can be taken out for how we can interpret a character if i want to write one favourite scene here its gonna be the whole movie coz i like everything in it technically i like the cinematography sound design and costumes but above all i liked performances and dialogues thanks to quentin who has given us more memorable movies in the last 20 years that are far superior in writing than anyone else but for me this is is my favourite quentin film and i will stick with this till he out performs himself by writing something much more weird than this a sure 5/5 for one of my favourite films no less everits very rare that you find such diversity in a movie now days. i like the story and its concept.a thumping good ode to friendship hope wit wiles and wisdom brimming with crackling characters and topped with the most twister of twists since the crying game. the shawshank redemption is a powerful and uplifting not to mention oscar-worthy film. in 2006 it was ranked as the greatest film ever by empire a film magazine. the year it came out it was nominated for 7 academy awards but did not win a single one because of a movie you may all remember forrest gump. its the no-bull performances that hold back the flood of banalities. robbins and freeman connect with the bruised souls of andy and red to create something undeniably powerful and moving. some of the shawshank redemption comes across as outrageously improbable. yet the film keeps pulling you back with its sense of striving humanity slowly turning the tables against evil.its very good film i watched it more than 10 times i like scene of the actress on the wall and the plan to escape i loved the actor personality morgan was protector to the movie i liked prison manager in acting all actors were perfect i adore adore adore this movie i will watch all movies of this actor thank you a lot but i need to know itits true linklater took 12 years to develop his family of characters while i was intimidated by the 3 hour run time i have to admit there was not a moment of this film i could have done without this is more than a coming of age story the title family or motherhood would be just as appropriate set in texas the screenplay is natural and reminiscent of plenty of linklaters other work a film that begins with dialog unlike any other linklater films evolves into thoughtful poignant discourse not unlike that from the before series one character in a latenight nacho scene was perhaps a callback to the heady waking life with that said this absolutely is not a mere think piece what makes this film truly fantastic is how accessible the material is given its scope without giving any narrative away ill say that the story itself is absolutely engaging and not without surprises i watched many films at sundance 2014 including comedies and this was the first that had the audience reacting throughout we laughed gasped covered our eyes and i am sure more than a few of us wept the characters are well developed dont be fooled by the title  the spirit of boyhood is alive here but the female characters are thoroughly developed distinct and alive unfortunately though its 2014 this is a rarity in cinema like in waking life and a scanner darkly linklater has again delivered true visual innovation this time however his setup is simple shooting on film linklater replaced rotoscoping with time lapse has a single film ever intentionally traced a character over such a span of time? linklater wisely chose to reveal the main character to us subtly despite this the effect is riveting i am not exaggerating when i say that after i watched this film i sold all of my other tickets to sundance films viewing boyhood for the first time was such a joyful experience that i didnt want to tarnish the experience by any comparison everyone in the eccles theater shared a special few hours together though this only premiered a few days ago i am confident that this will go down as one of the most ambitious and rewarding film projects of our timeits the screenplay that runs a movie at the end. however prolific may be the story its the screen script that makes or breaks a movie. it applies other way too. the necessity for a movie is just screenplay and nothing else. quentin tarantino is the man if you agree the lines i said above. he is the master of characterization and intriguing screenplay. at times we feel fallen out of lengthy dialogues but it just happens to the opposite with tarantino. you would love to trade anything for a few extra verbose outbursts from winnfield. the blood the boldness the script the pace the magnificence. this is pure film making. and nothing is compromised. many wonder if this movie is overrated. i guess its about time we changed. this has all the elements for a blockbuster all time hit it never goes out of style. its unfortunate it came out in the gold age of american cinema- the 1990s. nonetheless its the crown of english cinema and will always be.its the only movie i will remember forever & wont ever refuse to watch once again there are many films which are great but this one is the most: stylish but democraticits the best sequel in box office in which the joker role is outstanding. bales batman is the definitive batman because we see everything in this character finally on film. martial arts skills cunning great tactical thinking forensic application technological genius to advance or improve luscious foxs inventions/technological breakthroughs intimidating personality and even a little swashbuckling at a running time of almost 3 hours the film never becomes dull which is pretty impressive. the movies action sequences are spectacularly well created and very intense. the dialogue between the characters are intelligent and highly believable. the movies soundtrack is terrific and really exemplifys many of the movies scenes. extremely well editing and sound use really develop many of the movies action scenes so its not just explosions and visuals like in many other movies. nolan creates a grand dirty engrossing world and his action sequences just hum. even if you hate batman you will love this film. if you dont then something beez wrongz with youz stunning in every aspect and exceeds all hype and expectation... cant wait to watch it again or for the blu-rayits the best movie ive ever seenpulp fiction made my believe to the chance strongerit really existsi mean luckthe screenplay is wonderfuldialogs are interesting and the characters are understandabletarantinos made a miracle that will never be forgottenpulp fictions incredible dialogs and great acts and informal storymade me not to move until the endmrdirector and his movie changed my idea about all the movies i watched after thattheres a dialog throughout the movie from the holy bible:and i will strike down upon thee with the great vengeance and furious anger those who attempt to poison and destroy my brothersand you will know my name is the lord when i lay my vengeance upon theeit may be about meat first i suspected him and i wanted to poison and destroy his brothersbut he really did ithe revenged me and after he got finished i really felt damned and crushedi thought pulp fiction is not a good one to spend your time and watch itbut it actually cost im sure it was one of the movies that its beginning was the end of itor in better languageit was one of the first postmodern moviestake it easy how can your luck be badthis movie has lots of bad chancesyour bosss wife overdoses and is dying on you and this thing must be unknownwhat will you doyou get out of the toilet and see your enemy is standing right at opposite of you and wants to kill you with your own gunor youre talking to your friend and hes sitting at the cars behind seatyou look at him during the talk and your pistols in your handsuddenly your gun takes the shot by itselfyou havent shot the legshandsor even the chest youve shot straight at your friends headand when you wake upyouve taken s--t in the car and its full of blood and skull pieceswhat will you do to hide from the copsthere are many things like thiswell its greatenjoy the acts and screenplaysome dialogs are so funny some are about bad thingspulp fiction is a real pulp fictionpulp fiction is the lord its strange in the last few years whenever ive watched a movie ive been counting the minutes even if im enjoying it has seemed like a task too some extent and i was aware of it boyhood was different at the risk of sounded pretentious it seemed like it was a version of my own memories linklater obviously played on this whether intentional or not it was there he manages to tap into your own life and make this film seem like you are the only person who is ever going to see this movie and its all for you which is am amazing feat im not sure whether ive ever felt this way about a film before i found myself coming to tears at points which werent even sad partsthe whole thing seemed like i was living out a life a strange and abstract version of my own even though the story of my life is a million miles away from masons i cant recommend this film enough the runtime just breezed by and i didnt want it to end i felt like i could have watched masons story for another 12 years simply breathtaking one of the greatest achievements in cinemaits really good. every single thing about this movie is cool. its my number one favourite movie of all time.  well actually the entire trilogy together is my favourite number one movie of all time.  theres no swearing or nudity. i still dont recommend it for the younger audience because there are some slightly frightening scenes though. but anybody over eleven shouldnt be bothered. i dont recommend it for arachnophobia because it might give them a heart attack. anyways this movie has an excellent beginning and a wonderful ending. and everything in the middle is great too. by all means rent it but make sure you watch the two first movies first.its not just the best batman film ever. its not just the best superhero movie ever. its more than a money-spinner a franchise a comic-book cash-in. the dark knight is a stunning piece of work that deserves every word of praise spoken about it. thank warner bros. for letting nolan make such a smart thrilling emotionally involving just terrifically well rounded and fully realized entertainment that challenges and elevates notions of what a so-called summer blockbuster can do. the dark knight is the best kind of sequel -- one that uses its predecessor as a gateway to explore new facets of its characters and its world.its my favorite movie not only because tarantino is a genius but because it have a lot of the greatest actors in it and is a complete masterpiece with violence blood bad words love and everything you want in a movie it is the best tarantino film for sure. usually i ask myself why does anybody make a movie like this it would be the best thing happening.because the movies we see today are almost all bad. so if you want to watch a great movie if you like action if you like gun shots if you like blood if you like black humor if you like john travolta uma thurman bruce willis tim roth if you like samuel l. jackson and if you like quentin tarantino and if you have not watched this movie yet go ahead and watch it.its hard where to start in such a great film i shall begin at the start in the early scenes of pulp fiction two hit-men come to interrogate a mad named brad although it is not a normal interrogation the language used is very witty and comical this is what makes it my favourite scene what also is comical about this scene is where brad begins to stutter and summer jules begins to threaten him waving a gun in his face whilst delivering his famous what phrase jules is one of the top characters of the film he clearly has more power and intelligence than his sidekick vincent he also is the main speaker of the film a few times throughout the film he delivers his famous bible quotation before executing his victims but as we progress in the film jules understands he has been saved by a miracle and he slowly begins to turn his life around john travolta and samuell jackson were great actors in this film and i think this was the beginning of jacksons acting career this film was well thought through and the final result was beyond expected its no wonder that fans spend so much time debating what was in the suitcase as pulp fiction leads you on a trail of mystery throughout the whole film you think you will see the contents of the box but you never do it is discussed but the item is never revealed the film has so many astonishing details many of which you wont pick up on the first viewing every time you watch it you pick up a detail that went unrecognised before what is the movies purpose exactly marsellus is the sort of character who is mentioned over the entire film while being unseen most of the time marsellus has extreme power over his men without even being present this power is what gets vincent to act in ways you would not ordinarily expect from a dumb stoned gangster faced with an attractive woman whose husband has gone awayits hard to put in words how much i love this movie but here it goes. pulp fiction is an absolute masterpiece. a story thats told in non-linear fashion and keeps you guessing what will happen next...even if youve viewed it before. its so amazing that its nearly flawless where to begin where to begin. the dialog is interesting yet realistic. rather than giving us frequent exposition which most filmmakers suffer from tarantino has found a way for his memorable characters to discuss pointless things that are fascinating to listen to while developing strong character traits. the movies time-line is complex but to summarize it in one sentence it shifts around both forward and backwards between sequences. the direction is sure-handed and tarantino isnt afraid to hold a shot that flows smoothly with the way its edited. the casting is first-rate this is the movie that helped revive john travoltas career and made the rest of the actors reputable to the hollywood system. for those who are concerned about the level of violence its actually not as graphic as it seems. yes its intense but if you look closely the content of it isnt gratuitous or repulsive. gene siskel touched upon this in one of his reviews with roger ebert. for example bruce willis swipes a man with a samurai sword. the victim is faced away from the camera so you dont see the weapon attack him. then when willis stabs the sword into the guys knee its out of frame and we only hear the sound effect & see his reaction. dont worry im wrapping this up. if you can surpass the hype and enjoy it for what it is you are going to have a fun two hours. hope you see it after reading this and enjoy your tasty burgerits hard for me to rate a comic book movie 100% the only movies of the genre that deserve this are superman1978 spider-man 2 and the dark knight but why right in the beginning we see the joker robbing a bank with a plan that is for me as good as the final plan of oceans eleven and this is only the first scene youll see  in the movie at least 2 equally brilliant plans. the jokers philosophy is so well made that in sometimes youll forget that he is just a maniac and even think that he is right. despite the fact that cristian bale is not very good playing bruce wayne its not that bad hes just there. now lets talk about the ledgers performance of course it deserved the oscar of course it is awesome but i think that its not only him that made this character great i mean almost every lines that comes out of the jokers mouth is memorable and its not only because ledgers performance its the excellent script that makes this. like the critic pablo villaca said  see the vulnerable and tragic figure of batman diving in the shadows of a city desperate for heroic figures is one of the strongest and saddest images that the genre ever produced  this complexity is what makes the dark knight different that other good superhero movies like iron man. verdict: with an unusual complexity the dark knight puts superhero movies in another degree of film-making and storytelling now go watch this.its easy to say that lotr: the return of the king has the most interaction of frodo baggins and samwise gamgee of all the lotr movies. a result of that is you get to really see the great chemistry exhibited by these two actors working together. this is the best of all the lotr movies in my opinion the way all the stories tie together just works to perfection. finally you can see aragorn taking his rightful place as the new king. when frodo finally gets to mordor and throws the ring into the pits of it is an extremely well done scene. this is probably the longest single movie not counting the godfather movies ive ever seen but it entertains from start to finish.its easy to create an action movie based on big guns big men screaming and big name actors not this movie this movie had a style all of its own it was fresh fun and exhilarating something that this movie does differently than other action films is actually use the camera in its advantage instead of having the camera be something to put on a tripod while waiting for the special effects to happen the camera is used to portray fluid motion you can see every punch gunshot and stab easily and the camera compliments them perfectly if i were to complain about something it would be the characters i feel that the characters werent anything special and they all seemed to be the same person played by a different actor however that doesnt necessarily matter for what they lack in characters they succeed in a surprisingly interesting story the antagonist wasnt the runofthemill mad man who wants to take over the world the antagonist had solid reasons for what hes doing and the film explains it fairly well essentially this was a very fun movie and i highly suggest it if youre in the mood for a brand new type of action movieits been 5 years since the dark knight was shown into theaters. i was 9 when i watched it and it was good. i kinda appreciated it when i returned on becoming a dc fan back in 2011 when the new 52 came yes i am a new 52 non-hater. the movie is so good that i kept on watching it over and over again. a total reinvention of batman. it received a heck lot of awards and nominated for so many times. first superhero film to reach 1b worldwide and it is not. the avengers heath ledger did an amazing job as the joker. christian bale once again took over the role and nailed it again. it is better than the dark knight rises which happened to be a not so good work for nolan. nolan wasnt planning for a third film but it happened. this led to a lot of mistakes and flaws. the dark knight had lots of interesting scenes and intense action. i just hope we can study the movie for my literature class. scene by scene we can discuss. ha ha. it had good music good tone and epic directing. it went on into a good direction rises not so much. i loved the movie and better than man of steel. it didnt waste your 2 hours in which in mos did. even though i loved the movie.......i like how each character bruce alfred lucius joker harvey gordon did a great job. two-face had an amazing reinvention too. better than the tommy. lee-jones two-face in batman forever. the dark knight was an unexpected movie. it did amazing great after. batman begins was released in 2005 and three years later you have the perfect superhero movie sequel. rip to heath ledger. won best supporting actor in the oscars....died with a great movie and one of the best movies in hollywood history and it will always be remembered. now that ben affleck will take over i expect good acting skills and how he acts as both batman and bruce wayne... thanks for readingits an exciting movie i didnt get bored in this 2.5 hours great there are several reasons attracting me to watch this movie. i think the first one is that movie was actually filmed in hk. when i first heard this news i felt quite excited about it and so wished i could see the real batman on the top of ifc or central plaza.. of course i didnt come to see him. its actually amazing that seeing hong kong in that famous hollywood movie hong kong is very beautiful of course its sweet to hear some cantonese as well the second reason was heath ledger. i was very interested in seeing how this character made him that stressful did he die for taking too much drugs which could relieve his stress or he was just a drugs abuser i dont know but i am sure its very pity for a young actor like him died so early he acted actually quite good in the movie his facial and body expressions were too great as well as the way he speaking the third reason was edison chan. how did his sex scandal affect his character he was appeared in the movie within 5 seconds and spoke 1 sentence. i had no idea what he supposed to act in this film but i couldnt see his character is necessary in that movie. in fact another unknown chinese guy mr lau was an important character. i like that scene most when the joker planted explosives on two ferries of evacuees and gave the passengers on board the chance to destroy the opposing vessel one full of prison convicts and another with civilians in order to save their own lives. when the civilians first heard that some of them had already suggested the cops to push the button and let all prisoner die. to be fair the cop decided to distribute everyone a piece of paper and let all people to have a vote for saving themselves or killing others. surprisingly there were still quite a lot of people voting to not kill the prisoners. i think its a very hard decision a man stood up and said the criminals were deserved to die and they were sinless. nobody wanted to take the action to kill the people in other boat that man thought he could do so he stood up and pick up the controller and eventually put it down and returned to his seat. on the other hand the boat with prison convicts were silent they were humbled as they realized they had committed different types of crime. at the very last minute a big man stood out and told the cop that i know you dont want to die you can tell everyone i attack you and steal your controller and he got the controller and threw it into sea. what a brave man i think this guy is much better than those civilians. at last both vessels occupants decide they would rather not sacrifice the lives of the passengers in the other vessel for their own. eventually nobody killed as the joker didnt put the timer on its just a trick that he wanted to test how selfish people were in the very hard moment its great that people won on the other hand even a very good men can fall like harvey dent the so called white knight of the city corrupted as her girlfriend was killed. good story that let me to think more about the meaning of scarify never think how important you are. dont be that over-confident and arrogant always be humble like the sinner instead of heroits an action movie starring christian bale who to me is the best batman ever.in the movie batman tries to save gotham city from villains along his servant alfred he manages that with his technology and martial training. bruce wayne a billionaire uses his technology of building weapons from wayne enterprises in the purposes of good.fox morgan freeman builds the weapons and the car of batman. after joker exits the picture of villains in gotham i looks like its time for batman to have another enemy so the producers introduce bane tom hardy a very powerful enemy who always wears a mask because of an awful accident.it has an amazing cast with marion cotillard anne hathaway joseph gordon lewitt and others. christian bale represents very well the epitome of a billionaire at day superhero at night.  you feel as if you could reach out and touch the prison walls. and darabont is an accomplished button pusher. he coaches the actors so that you always know exactly who to root for and against. when it comes to a character like the warden bob gunton all bible- thumping righteousness the movie has no compunction about turning up the hissability factor. he starts out mean then turns meaner then meaner still. when andy blasts mozarts the marriage of figaro over loudspeakers to the prison work field it becomes a full-scale opera-soothes-the-savage-breast number with the prisoners standing open-mouthed at the sublime sounds. the scene is meant to fire our righteous liberal hearts. it helps of course that most of the prisoners dont actually behave like criminals. they never say a word about their pasts-even andy remains a downtrodden cipher-and this lends the proceedings a hollow generic feel as if darabont had constructed a blueprint out of old prison melodramas. a movie like the shawshank redemption with its brazenly mechanical plotting and its wish-fulfillment finale requires a lead actor who can carry us on the wings of his good spirits. tim robbins is crafty and likable when andy is hoodwinking the guards and he makes you feel the characters mute anguish. yet in shouldering what is essentially a laconic- good-guy neo-gary cooper role robbins never quite makes emotional contact with the audience. his face foggy and placid suggests an overgrown babys  theres something naggingly unformed about him. morgan freeman on the other hand with his delicate smolder his eyes that seem to peer directly into everyones soul makes red feel genuine lived-in. speaking of the prison walls he says first you hate em. then you get used to em. after long enough you get so you depend on em. thats institutionalized. with his gift for rapt pauses for caressing just the right syllable freeman can make a speech like that sound like one of the philosophical nuggets of the ages. then again isnt it time morgan freeman stopped playing the soulful sidekick while were on the subject of prison walls an actor as great as he is shouldnt get too used to movies like this one. b-its amazing how some people think this movie is so awesome it has everything you need you want a love story its there you want revenge its got you covered they took an old classic and gave it a nice twist they brought the story to life and gave it flare the movie is not dull at all seeing how stephans love turns to hate was great how they showed him become the monster was classic angelina jolie acting was on point she played the part of the scorned fairy so well you emphasized with her story i wanted her to get revenge against stephan the girl who played snow white fit the ideal character her smile and demeanor showed caring and wonder you believed the fairy land was real i have nothing negative to say about this movie its a nice take on an old storyits always refreshing to see the backstory of how evil develops in past days it was too easy to show the simplistic snidely whiplash versions of villains twirling their handlebar mustaches its even better when the villains redeems themselves and the cherry on top is when a 53 old moviegoer can enjoy the same film among a theatre full of children albeit the crying babies note to parents dont rule out giving your bundles of joy just a very tiny bit of nighttime tylenol about an hour before the movie starts theyre too young to remember being there anyway and everyone else doesnt have to hear their screeching thanks in the tradition of those writers who helped bring to the screen the latest versions of darth vader dr baltar and mila kuniss witch theodora theyve shown very effectively the complicated layers of how evil develops from otherwise good souls such is the case in this departure from the original sleeping beauty reimagining angelinas winged maleficent starts as a loving but aggressive protector of her home but like two of the above mentioned characters betrayal and heartbreak provide the catalyst of transformation from peace and love to revenge and hate then to vindicate the audience from having any misplaced empathy is the redemption the catalyst for this is the love between maleficent and aurora played by elle fanning who adopts her as her fairy god mother this is quite a departure from the animated version i saw some 43 years ago which was 12 years after its 1959 release and angelinas version of maleficent is equally as different from eleanor audleys voiced version not to disparage the original i like this story retold much better i can remember not being that impressed at 10 as i am by this latest version other moral lessons such as the effects of greed ambition fear etc are well taught without the unnecessarily preachy exposition to me this makes a film experience that can be enjoyed by children and adults alike this is one the better efforts put forth by disney lets hope the tradition continues with the upcoming star wars features too bad walt didnt live to see cgi and the latest talent lastly im hearing these rumors about this movie being angelinas big comeback? hmm i never knew she was gone then im always rewatching gia and tomb raider in between her projectsits a usual misconception when people say that dark knight is overrated just because of an amazing performance by heath ledger as the joker. the jokers acting which by the way is one of the best acting you will ever find is just an icing over the cake. from the start the movie is fast paced which is necessary for a thriller movie which makes you lean forward with your chin on your palms elbows on your thighs and mouth wide open throughout the movie. the movie is one of its kind because you experience the best dialogues memorable performances great direction and an amazing message that goes through your heart. i have already mentioned about the performances which is topped by heath ledger as the joker but the dialogues cannot be appreciated unless you see the movie itself but the movie has nerve-chilling dialogues that you cannot miss. the message on the other hand is something really extra ordinary. something that you wouldnt expect from a superhero movie. at the end of the movie batman takes the responsibility of killing a certain number of cops. or in simple words he portrays himself as a villain in the eyes of people. what kind of a dumbstruck superhero would do such a thing well only batman can. for the sake of people retaining their faith in good which was ignited in them by harvey dent batman risks his image by turning into an apparent villain. he believes that at the end of the day these citizens will be the heroes of themselves. he believes that some day gotham city will no longer need batman to bring justice. he wants them to be independent on batman. many people never like it in the first go. i myself never did. but watch it once more to understand why everything happens because the movie is directed in a very logical and planned way. everything in the movie has a reason for its occurrence. so those who havent seen the movie yet - you cannot miss this movie those who didnt like it for the first time - watch it again. and for those who loved it id still say - watch it again.its a masterpiece the best batman movie ever .. awesome screenplay by nolan brothers and all the other writers .. beautiful direction by nolan .. incredible acting performances by all the cast cristian balemorgan freemangary oldmanaaron eckhartand all the others did a fantastic job but according to me heath ledgers joker overshadowed all the performances ...he was exceptional . n surpassed jack nicholsons joker in all aspects ..plot was good ..action scenes were awesome .. dialouges were super awesome ....camerawork was beautiful ..its the movie u ll never forget .. its a thrilling experience ..u cant expect more from a batman movie ...its a must watch a true eye candy its 400 in the morning and i just saw that almost three hours long movie but yet there was not a single moment of sleepy like it would come with other movies that is the greatest story ever made the true life so much ordinary things that it becomes noordinary film whit lots of energy enthusiasm i got that feeling like falling in love or being on the most beautiful place you ever seen it forces you to think a lot                           i could probably wrote much more but than no one would start to read  ps sorry for my englishit well deserved the 11 oscars it is brilliant these movies will never be forgotten. peter jackson is a genius these movies are well acted visually rich have great dialogue and a great story. i wont bother with the story because it is one of the most famous of all time and pretty simple so i will just get to the movie. revolutionary visual effects cast - perfect. elijah wood is perfect as frodo ian mckellen as gandalf best casting choice ever viggo mortensen who would have though everyone else is also great even christopher lee who i dont think has ever not played a villain but that is just because he is so good at it and of course who can forget cate blamchett who is barely on screen but all the same is excellent. dialogue excellent what more can i say if you havent seen this movie you have not been born yet this is one of the best series created. fantasy 1. lord of the rings 2. chronicles of narnia & harry potter 3. cant think of one worth putting up there have been plenty of dudsit was the film that never seemed to have a break cut out for it. adapted from a steven king short story usually a sure sign of success yet a disappointment at the box office. nominated for seven oscars yet emerging with no wins. but hope sprung eternal and as life began to imitate art like its central characters the film the shawshank redemption overcame such initial adversity to become one of the most revered and cherished films of all time. director/screenwriter frank darabont working from steven kings short story rita hayworth and the shawshank redemption brings the tale to life in a superbly powerful and emotionally flooring fashion. darabonts script executes the incredibly difficult task of speaking directly to the human spirit with its tale of passion and dedication overcoming captivity and adversity. few modern films are bold enough to tackle such shamelessly inspirational themes as shawshanks without coming across as painfully clichÍ©d but darabonts airtight script chock full of timeless lines and steady careful directing are enough to raise the film above such concerns instead marking a film of which the emotional magnitude is seldom paralleled. from roger deakins sweeping operatic cinematography to thomas newmans truly beautiful and inspiring musical  to the dank gritty realism of shawshank prison itself the films consistent quality on all fronts is truly stunning. it is easy to see a story such as this easily falling flat with an inferior cast taking on the material but darabonts incredibly gifted and memorable cast is truly up to the challenge taking a wonderful story and making it truly timeless. tim robbins truly brings unconventional convict andy dufresne to life never without a passionate twinkle in his eye even in his most beaten down and hopeless of scenes. rather than typical leading man grandstanding robbins is wise enough to remain subtle and detached throughout making the role all the more mysterious and endearing as a result. the inspired casting of morgan freeman as fellow inmate red resulted not only in a series of sumptuous voiceovers by one of the most melodious voices in hollywood but also in a genuinely heartwarming supporting character with freeman building a career of playing similar wise mentor figures off his performance. the supporting cast being comprised mainly of relative unknowns strengthens the believability of their characters leading the audience to see them as their character and not as the star behind the role. bob gunton is chillingly effective as the hate-inspiring prison warden infusing more menace into his reedy voice and deadpan stare than any scenery chewing antagonist could capture. character actor clancy brown also crafts another simple but effective antagonistic role as the captain of the guards. gil bellows is a strong presence as a rebellious inmate and james whitmore is charming and lovable as aged prison librarian brooks. overall the shawshank redemption is an astonishing accomplishment addressing shamelessly uplifting themes in a fashion which is sentimental but never sappy larger than life but never melodramatic. in many ways the film feels like a throwback to the days of classic cinema where directors strove to make films which made their audiences happy but darabont easily dodges contemporary scorn by unabashedly and honestly pitching the film towards the human spirit and firmly establishing it as a timeless classic with its impeccable package of flooring technical work screen writing and acting. far from being a simple prison drama the sheer emotional voyage of the shawshank redemption is enough to drain any viewer both crushing their spirits then euphorically raising them in a truly peerless fashion. while red may declare hope to be a dangerous thing its darabonts fearless tackling of the tricky subject which really sets shawshank free. -10/10  beautiful but plain  action-packed but clever  touching but cynical  and oh these characters.. i love the film though i dont count tarantino a genius or something as you may think not. it was the best film i have ever seen and could watch it over again. it was quite disappointing that saruman wasnt in there but because of that you had a slightly happier ending. if he had been in there the film would have been 45 minutes longer. anybody that is still confused should read the book rather than wait a year until the extended version comes out.it was a great moviede palma did a great job all the writers did a great job tooif only mission impossible 2 could have been as good as the first mission impossible the story line in the first one was great along with the actingit was a great movie. i would love to play a part in it i am a huge fan of all of the lord of the rings. i love how each one leaves you wanting more. you cant stop at just one. you must keep going... its infectious its got plenty of mysterylovefriendshipbattlesmagic its really just a great set. good verses evil as most movies have but so much morei am a die hard fan of lord of the rings all of them and that is including the new hobbit is awesome i can not wait to see the next one i will be at the theater as soon as it comes out everything i imagined as a small girl comes to life in these movies. its such a beautiful fantasyadventure movie for every child and adult who has an imagination.it was a day like any other. wake up early morning eat school jack off etc. etc. etc. i would come back home from school shower eat then try and find ways to waste time. i would flip through channels like a magazine or probably treat myself to a snack. the thing that made this day special was that i was going to watch imo the greatest movie of all time. before watching this movie my taste was.... generic to say the least. my favorite movie was the a-team. my taste was horrible. i recently watched inception so i was slowly being... devoured or welcomed whichever way you see it into the movie world. after watching this piece of art however i was just amazed. the acting was amazing. the directing was pitch perfect. and the script... oh jumping jesus on a pogo stick the script left me speechless. i envy those movie watchers who get to watch this for the first time. anyways fast forward a couple of months later i already watchedit took me a while before i saw this movie i read the plot and saw a trailer but it didnt quite managed to catch my attention i had the idea that it would be more of a kids movie one reason was rocket the raccoon yesterday i finally watched it and boy was i wrong the guardians of the galaxy is a random band of rascals made up of an assassin a raider two bounty hunters kind of and a huge blue guy hungry for vengeance for different reasons they find them selfs fighting an evil set on destruction on epic scale that is threatening any planets in the galaxy now you think thats really nothing new and youre right it isnt but take my advice ad see it if you have any interest in scifi action or comedy you will find all three the performance is good at worst and excellent at best the whole range from cgi and environments are perfect right down to small details and corny things like a precious walkman goolge it   see it just doit starts out with two talking about job it continues with two people talking about job actually all this movie shows are two people doing their job but these are different people throughout the film tim roth and amanda plummer give a good reminiscent view of true romance while john travolta and cool coiffured samuel l jackson simply do a job - it is just that their job is killing people their killing scene is one of the most nerve wrecking imaginable especially for the victims due to jacksons quite eccentric behavior bruce willis and ving rhames turn from partners in betrayal to enemies to partners in revenge in an unheard of plot twisting sequence the flic actually looks more difficult than it is by far we have three stories woven into one apart from the pre-credit intro and the subsequent travolta / jackson opening stories #2 and#3 are told first and then rounded out by #1 #2 vincent vega and marsellus wallaces wife shows what could have been - under different circumstances - the beginning of a romance and what turns into pure horror due to mixed-up addictions #3 the gold watch shows prize fighter willis who - more or less - accidentally breaks a deal and thus is not longer safe in town before he can run away he has to go back to his apartment to pick up his gold watch that his girl-fiend had forgotten after an encounter with travolta he bumps into ving rhames whom he had the deal with after this the movie gets really weird - and good then in #1 we are shown travolta and jackson who kill a few guys who did wrong witness a miracle and see a quite normal business day turned into bulls**t when travolta loses control of his finger - enter tarantino and keitel the movie ends with plummer and roth in a different-angle version of the pre-credit sequence what makes this movie really good are the dialogues plummer / roth travolta / jackson travolta / thurman willis / rhames willis / taxi driver angela jones keitel / tarantino and sequences like the christopher walken scene this movie is so good that nobody misses the box fight which could have made a good scene all in all this is a true cinematic masterpieceit seems that pulp fiction is one of the most discussed films on the imdb and the opinions seem to be split totally 50/50 like with almost every other tarantino pic out there but whether you like it or not whether you hate it or love or whether your a big qt fan or just hate the guy you have to admit that no film is more 100% sure on becoming a classic later on in fact this great rift between movie-goers about this film is one of the things that will make it a timeless classic whether you like it or not personally i think this is one of the 5 best pictures ever made both from a totally critical perspective and also from a more personal point of view since i think that quentin is the best living director/writer in the business so go out and rent the movie and decide for yourself if you arenÓ‰t squeamish youÓ‰ll probably love itit seems kenneth branagh have been trying to recreate the success of their first 90s anime ripoff dead again  with little or no success for over a decade now sometime even going so far as to credit the original as is the case with the magic flute  no attempt was made to distract from the plagiarism but here they decided to pull out the stops and make their films as wild as possible some may defend cinderella 2015 as some have defended the hunger games mockingjay  part 1 but trust me this is worse than the hunger games mockingjay  part 1 i dont know where to begin with the awfulness of this film its so corny minddumbingly so all of the dialogue is ridiculous wow how low do you have to be? what kind of sociopathic creature stoops that low to wantonly and ignorantly destroy beauty and by this i mean kenneth branagh who? simple jr and his boyfreind thats whoit may be over 10 years old now but return of the king definitely hasnt lost any of its shine. after a lucky victory at helms deep aragorn legolas gimli and there new friends from rohan set out to isengard to rescue merry and pippin. we also see sam and frodo bravely continuing there journey to mt doom with the aid of gollum. the acting throughout this film is brilliant with more amazing performances from ian mckellen gandalf viggo mortensen aragorn and of course sean astin samwise gamgee. andy serkis gollum also deserves a lot of credit. he did a fantastic job of playing gollum and really put his heart and soul into creating such a memorable character. and with two major battles this really is the icing on the cake for the lord of the rings series. with stunning backdrops impressive effects and a brilliant ensemble cast this is a must see film for any fantasy fan. it also has the perfect balance of action fantasy romance and fighting. looking back its no wonder this film won 11 oscars and peter jackson deserves all the praise he gets for adapting tolkiens wonderful stories onto the big screen. whether you watch the original or the extended edition this film will not disappoint you.it looks as though maleficent is another of those movies that sits under the disney banner yet is far from a childrens only movie theres death destruction duplicity and derring do in equal measure yes despite the fact that there are fairies nymphs and other mythical creatures that might inhabit the usual childrens story this would probably sit more comfortably with the original grimm stories than disneys animated version from 1959 the fact is though after the pirates of the caribbean series we are fast becoming used to a more adult story line in disneys live action movies and in my opinion theyre all the better for it maleficent appears to follow the same course as sleeping beauty but is far less predictable and has a large number of twists and turns seeing the story from a refreshing viewpoint that of the socalled wicked witch  who this time isnt a witch at all the stereotypes that usually accompany disney films with this kind of story premise are still there but this time are somehow more real maleficent presents us with a very believable plot  despite and including the fairies  and strong characters with very real motivation the approach used in this movie was enough to keep us glued to the screen from beginning to end with jolie in brilliant form in the lead role the story was riveting keeping us guessing right up until the endit is year 2009 and yet this movie is still the best movie i have ever seen. it truly and rightfully deserves to be the best movie of all times. story telling acting directing anything that you can imagine about a movie is so perfectly done. i believe everyone will have his own message from the movie but if you want to see a movie that tells how important the role of hope in our life is you are at the correct address. the atmosphere in the prison the way people feel and the way all these things were put together in a two hours movieit is the most great film in the history of american cinema. robbins and freeman are fantastic. it implants hope in our soul. friendship relation between the robbins and freeman in the film is very nice. i know that movie is the first in the imdb schedule  and its really worth it. when i watch any movie i always return to your appreciation of it and relied upon but in this film ive seen just so i said it deserved to be the best and when i returned to the evaluation have really found is also.but i do not know why did not achieve high income while movie display but perhaps it was due to have been introduced in the early nineties of the last century and the film does not usually attracts young researcher substance or sexual violence.it is the best superhero film ever made. the batman proved that he is more than a hero the dark knight n heath ledger the joker commendable villaini think the best villain ever complete portray of lucifer a great n best child of lucifer. the all praise goes to the whole team of the film n especially to the christopher nolan. the script is extraordinary the screenplay is unbelievable classic and cinematography that is basis of the featured filmsis truly exceptional and remarkable. i think the joker more ruled than the dark knight and its seemed the serious and grave tom and jerry storyin which the jocular criminal joker is tom and the classic hero is batman:the dark knight and at the end the good won. loved it most....  i felt as if ive gone through the struggles that he went through as well. you could see how time is irrelevant in prison  you feel minutes go by when its actually days weeks months and years. and then youll feel disappointed at all those years where you could have done something different in the world outside. the film is also an eye-opener. you open your eyes to what its like in prison  although the prison in the movie seems more ideal than real life prisons. you get a glimpse of brutality and rape inside prison. you get to see how some prisoners become institutionalized and never seem to want to leave anymore. there is also a depiction of how rampant corruption is and its sad to think that those involved are the ones who are supposed to be protecting and abiding by the law. the cast is great. i couldnt ask more from tim robbins and morgan freeman. even the other prisoners are good too. overall i think that the main point of this movie is never to lose hope  that hope is always a good thing. this movie is as equally good as forrest gump and pulp fiction movies that were made in the same year as this but i cant understand why only these two movies got most of the attention. all in all this movie certainly is the kind of movie to watch before you die. it is really amazing movie i have ever seen in my lifetime. the cast and the story of the movie are really successful. andy is a passionate character and he is convicted of murdering his wife and her lover despite his claims of innocence. it is so touching to spend almost two decades in the prison. old-fashioned prisons in the 90s are full of bad guy who dont expect anything from the life. and  they dont think how we escape here. howeverit is one of the most important movies of the 1990s if not ever because it put quentin tarantino on the map as one of the directors to look out for pulp fiction stars tim roth amanda plummer john travolta samuel l jackson bruce willis ving rhames uma thurman christopher walken harvey keitel and many many more and was written and directed by quentin tarantino why is pulp fiction considered a masterpiece because it has really well written dialog _„_ the driving force behind this movie is the dialog despite all the mob and gangster elements this movie has if you love superbly written dialog in movies you will probably like pulp fiction from the get going pulp fiction you know exactly what movie you are in for _„_ great dialog a lot of racial slurs and the movie being obscurely original instead of running in chronological order from start to finish the movies chapters are all mixed up in a really stylish way half of the fun you will have with this movie is piecing the movie together after the first time you watch it moreover the characters are awesome as well _„_ samuel l jackson and john travolta make this movie however they are not the only ones who make the movie great another thing that works for pulp fiction is the soundtrack after you watch pulp fiction you will have all these songs in your head that will make you buy the soundtrack cd because they are all so catchy the songs are also very well edited into the scenes in this movie a dialog based movie that should be extremely boring but in this case it is not _„_ great acting a great premise great dialog it even proves that violence can indeed be funnyit is one of the best movies ive watched as a great admirer of angelina jolie i confess i was watching the movie just because of her but i liked everything the story we all already know totally changed its like if who told the story had never thought like the wicked witchwicked witch who no longer deserves to be called in this way the way what the film shows that true love neednt be between a man and a woman maleficent was the mother that aurora had not even after all the disappointments maleficent shows his good side that had never died was just hiddenno matter what you think about fairy tales you need to watch this film because you will not see anything like this for a long timeit is great how they portrait the joker with his jokes and smiling. the whole entire movie is rally good drama. every cut-scenes is carefully taken and well prepared and i think is really awesome. the fighting is great to even thought you dont see so much fighting in this film because i have always think of the batman is more like a cool detective dress up as a bat that uses really cool toys. i dont know exactly if this film follows any comic book because i havent read any of them but i like how they introduce the joker and two face. the its film based more in a way of curing the city of the criminal activity and gangs which i think is great.it is a movie made by a passionate film maker whose passion could be sensed in every set pieces and story elements .i happened to be very fortunate to get to watch it on its opening day 18 july 2008.and whatever ill assumption i made before entering the theater was completely vanished and i was speechless from its glittering imax footage action chase sequences to human emotions  everything is top notch i hardly believe ever there could be any film made with such perfection. this is not an ordinary movie which is made from computer graphics footage but believe me the stunts are for real and performed under strict guidance and a lot of practice and a lot of hard work . talking about the story  you could sense minute details of human emotions and it feels so refreshing that you would definitely be not forgetting at all .it seems pretty rare for some blockbuster movie to offer that thing. 10 on 10 from me worth more than 100 time watchit is a masterpiece quentin tarantino arrives to immortality a different film language that had never seen that said tarantinos twist on the pulp genre is also damn near a work of art at 31 he shows a disdain for flashy style and lofty pretension his passion is for storytelling that allows the most outrageous characters to reveal their feelings in long takes and torrents of words poetic and profane pulp fiction proves that tarantino is the ideal director for preserving the verbal rhythm and wicked playfulness of his scripts he revels in pop culture especially that of the 70s and hes no snobit is a great movie because you can see it in two ways: as a normal spectator enjoying the scenes the story and the sketches and as a really accurate spectator trying to keep in mind all the little details understanding all the connections between facts words and characters if you watch it this way at the end of the movie when you realize the correct time order of the scenes you notice that you missed so many details and you want to start the movie again watching it with another point of view it does not matter how many times you watch the entire film there are always new details and links you may discover the characters are great with a good balance between action fun serious moments and drama a really must see film that defines a cinematographic styleit is a great movie amazing this movie is one cool movie i never saw anything like this before you will like it a lot i like this movie more than any movie this movie is the best pg13 i ever saw you have never seen a movie this good before i think this maybe one of the best pg13 movie in the whole world i can not wait till the dark knight rises in imax now that will be good this movie is a masterpiece it is amazing i never saw a movie this good before it is the best pg13 movie in the whole world this movie is a knockout it hits a home run it is a movie that you will like a lot it is one of the best best pg13 movies i ever saw i think this is the best pg13 movie pg13 movies i like this movie more than any pg13 movie i ever saw make this the number 1 pg13 movie in the whole world this movie is one awesome movie make this movie number 1 of the best pg13 movies i like this pg13 moviesit is 2014 and i still dont get tired of seeing this movie. and by this movie iam not referring to the third part but all of them. it is a movie that has everything youd like to be in a movie: it is the movie with more body count 836 only in this part it has action adventure and even you could see romance between some characters.it is impossible to get bored with this film it is full of epic quotes epic scenes and epic wars all this complemented with a good story. all in all this movie deserves a 10 and in my humble opinion it is the best movie you can see ever. many years will have to pass to see a movie better than this.it honestly does little to his stature by mentioning that author j.r.r. tolkien was a genius but its as true as anything i know. his words told a story but its what they leave behind with the reader that made all the difference. something deep touched director peter jacksons heart when he first read it and i know this because i felt it too when i read it and again the same feeling when i saw the movies. say what you will about the integrity of events or characters in this adaptation but theres no denying the passion and solidarity to tolkiens work. `the lord of the rings: the return of the king is the point where all lines characters story events from past to present draw together and complete the picture so wide in scale so epic in its execution that it takes more than just a few minutes to truly appreciate the complexity of this giant film. i have seen nothing like it before in my life and remain in awe of the gift of success that came at such an enormous risk. much that was once doubted or criticized has been washed away in a sweet tide of victory from the filmmakers. but aside from all the obvious technical and narrative achievement of each film the most amazing feat that jackson and company was able to accomplish was bringing these three continuing films together seamlessly as one free flowing tale. as the camera lens widens with epic visuals of massive armies and battle scenes the story simultaneously narrows in on the relationships and character struggles. on one hand its about the peoples of middle-earth and on the other its about the individual characters whose fate is entwined into these horrific circumstances. neither one overshadows the other as jackson manages to juggle everything with such care and expert deliverance. much of the films success is due to the intricate development of so many wonderful characters that remain at the foreground of jacksons film versions. superb casting has seen this become the most beloved element in the films something you remember strongly toward the end when we see them saying goodbye there is a genuine feeling of loss and accomplishment as we conclude this journey together. peter jackson has worked hard its plain to see and the rewards are more than one could wish for. what he has done with this legendary tale is go far beyond just making three movies. he has ushered in a new era in film with outstanding quality and approach ever vigilant of the viewers. these films are for the fans by the fans and he has done all this without taking his eye off the ball as a filmmaker. it is over now but the films are instant classics that will live on through the test of time. i am thankful for the chance to see these movies in my time and will be forever grateful for peter jackson and his good heart. here at the end of it all i look back spellbound. `the return of the king is an amazing conclusion not only to the hard long journey but also to the captivating world of middle-earth. so much has gone into these films and so much has come out of them to the lives of the people around it. i am touched by peter jackson and the work from his amazing visionaries who knew above all else that what they had was something special to tell. every frame is littered with detail and splendor. not a moment is lost to carelessness or brevity. its loving and frightening. it will take you on the trip of your life into golden fields and dark tunnels. overall it just tells a fantastic story. its a story that has lived on for generations and will continue to inspire and entertain. we will never see the likes of it again as it respectably slips into history as the great trilogy that ruled them all. for the quest is achieved and now all is over. i am glad to have been there too.  - 5 out of 5it faithfully showed all the best things from the books and brought middle earth to our tv and cinema screens which is awesome and legendary all in all one of the best movies iwe ever watched and i strongly recommend for everyone to see itthe remorse will not be shown i guaranty you that.the movie can surely be watched by non fantasy fans because its beautifully shot effects and the music were perfectly done and mixed...i just have one thing that bugs me:peter should show the audience extended edition because it shows what happened to sarumanand that is a big minus to all book lovers.aside from that everything else was more than satisfying for me and for most people...it couldnt be another better ending for this wonderful trilogy. all the work is fantastic but this third part of this story couldnt be better. congratulations to all the team. i had read the trilogys book before watching the film and i thought in a epic history that is how it has been i was not wrong. so the only more thing i can say is if there is someone that has not seen this film yet dont wait more. also i recommend the new trilogy based in the world of j.r.r. tolkien called the hobbit its awesome. perhaps one of the most important point to have made this film the best option it has been the choice of the environment. simply amazing.it almost goes without saying that pulp fiction was one of the most influential and iconic films of the 90s in all honesty it probably was the very top film in this regard i can still remember seeing it for the first time and being amazed i had loved quentin tarantinos earlier reservoir dogs but thought he had upped the ante even higher with this movie seeing it again recently i have to say it remains an incredibly well made and entertaining bit of cinema and even though i have enjoyed all of tarantinos films since there is no doubt in my mind that his three 90s crime films tower above all of his post millennium filmography in those ones he seemed to integrate his obsession with pop cultural references into strong stories as opposed to nowadays where his movie references have become so blatant and full on that they have become an actual handicap of sorts pulp fiction is the movie where he best showcases his style in a movie that is consistently brilliant from start to finish its essentially three stories entwined all on the face of it standard crime cinema tales where something goes wrong but tarantino focuses on unusual details that make them completely original the chief aspect that differentiates them from others is his brilliant dialogue that is never afraid to go on non-plot related diversions in ways that utterly humanises the thuggish bad guys that populate his film the script is full of pop cultural references inventive profanity witticisms and even many moments of wisdom tarantinos primary gift and the one he will be remembered for is his gift for dialogue you get the impression that actors are instructed to deliver their lines word-for-word  this isnt a film that feels improvised in any way on some very odd occasions this can result in some lines feeling a little forced but the pay-off is massive as the script is quite simply genius in many ways this great writing has created some excellent iconic characters it doesnt do any harm either that the acting is top level throughout well with the exception of tarantinos cameo that is _„_ hes pretty terrible and should really never act but otherwise its quality all the way with standout turns from samuel l jackson john travolta bruce willis harvey keitel christopher walken and uma thurman jackson probably steals the show with the character jules but travolta is very impressive and convincing as vincent vega _„_ you really believe he is a pretty nasty bit of work under the charm thurman and willis play typical film-noir characters namely the femme fatale and the boxer who throws the fight _„_ both are excellent while keitel and walken have cameo roles with the former as the very memorable mr wolf while the latter is in an extremely funny role as an ex-soldier who wore a watch up his butt so whats it all about well the title says it all really because this is an unashamed bit of pulp fiction but a wonderfully original presentation of it its influence is other movies such as italian poliziotteschi and american film noir with a huge post-modernist make-over films specifically referenced include the italian connection a black and white gangster hit men are sent to sort a situation out and kiss me deadly a plot revolves around a suitcase that when opened has a mysterious glow it is essentially a crime-comedy with a real focus on humour this means that some of the strong violence is played simultaneously realistically but also for comic effect while the staggered time-line is constructed for maximum impact it is for example a pretty rare thing for a film to kill off a character vincent and then go back in time a little to watch his exploits in another escapade we know he is doomed but cant help but completely forget this fact its one of many reasons that this film stands out one of the very best of the 90s and tarantinos masterpiece is there anybody out there that was more excited about this movie than i was maybe_„_ but most probably not. ive been looking forward to another batman movie since the credits rolled on batman begins back in 2005. batman is a movie that needs no synopsis even for non-fans. but in case you are totally clueless all you need to know is that batman is a guy that dresses up in a bat costume and fights crime in gotham city. the dark knight continues where batman begins left off. christian bale reprises his role as barman from the last movie and this time he has two new villains: the joker played by heath ledger and two-face/harvey dent played by aaron eckhart. this is no doubt the most hyped movie of the year especially with heaths sudden death and i must tell you it was up to the hype or very very close to it. theres a buzz for an oscar campaign for heath and ill tell you right now that he was absolutely amazing and deserves an oscar or at least a nomination. if warner brothers didnt tell us heath was playing the joker i swear not many people would have guessed it was him. i know i wouldnt have. so is this a good movie or just a good-joker-used-to-promote-an-average movie good question. but an even better question is did you watch batman begins did you enjoy it if you watch this movie youll never want to watch batman begins again because the dark knight will make it look like the worst movie youve ever seen. i promise you. everyone is talking about the joker but harvey dent/two face is equally as good. his make- up as two face will blow you away and his acting is nothing less than amazing. everyone else reprised their role from the last movieis the dark knight best film ever made for me yes. the dark knight is a film thats fantastic on the action front seeds its acrobatics in its own reality and always feels relevant even when its ideas are drowned out by clatter. its just the best batman film ever. its just the best superhero movie ever. its more than a money-spinner a franchise a comic-book cash-in. the dark knight is a stunning piece of work that deserves every word of praise spoken about it.christopher nolan is much much smarter than your every filmmaker.this film is more than a comic-book adventure this is a sprawling epic crime. anyway chis nollan and batman for me  is a best picture.is the best movie of all time. not only for imdb users but also for other rewires. this movie has it all. suspense drama comedy tenderness friendship etc. the photography is also magnificent. the characters are the best actor in hollywood at that time. an incredible morgan freeman and tim robbins. the story is complete

transcends time and space i am not sure whether i am intelligent enough to review this film but as a normal viewer i am going to share my views about the interstellar experience my interstellar experience started even before watching the film itself i spent some time brushing up my knowledge about the theories discussed in the film the advantage of being a physics student made my work easy in fact the movie became much more understandable in the near future our earth becomes more polluted and human beings have to find a new home to survive or at least to stop their species from extinction nasa sends a group of explorers into a newly discovered wormhole to find a habitable land for the humans this is just the basic plot of a wonderful experience this is a christopher nolan film and he wants the viewer to have some basic knowledge of physics to understand the film he is best known for the novelty in themes and the emotional approach he takes the dark knight trilogy director maintains his trademark of elevating the content than the characters nolan literally takes us to the outer space from earth to various planets through the wormhole one would really feel oneself as cooper while watching the film placing some unexpected events in between the writer amazes the viewer especially the climax the final phases of interstellar were mindblowing and thought provoking i was blown away by the ideals nolan placed in the penultimate scenes the concept of fifth dimensional sequences inside the tesseract came out as a surprise those sequences were beyond my imagination one of the best climaxes ever while watching the climax only one thought appeared in my mind how can this nolan be so brilliant and imaginative_ special kudos to the nolan brothers for those excellent and heart touching dialogues even in the simpler scenes certain dialogues came out as wonder nolan wanted to express something which any space exploration film didnt express the eternity of love the emotional approach nolan takes to describe the fatherdaughter relationship between cooper and murph was heart touching he even draws a sketch over the life of space explorers how they spend years of their life selflessly searching for something that will be beneficial for the people on the earth keeping their lives at risk the unnoticed friendship between cooper & tars and the light humor they produce proves nolans mastery in presenting complex subjects in a simpler way christopher nolans films which are known for their utmost brilliancy in making also have memorable characters and interstellar is no exception oscar winning matthew mcconaughey perfected as cooper cooper will always remain as one of the most remarkable characters of all time he excelled in the emotional scenes i felt like crying when cooper watches the recorded videos sent to him from the earth such perfection anne hathaway and miachel caine too delivered memorable performances as amelia brand and professor brand anne was good in the emotional scenes especially in the scene she reveals her love for edmund miachel caine had an important role this time a lengthy one indeed the kid murph came out as a surprise mackenzie foy had all the emotions required for the character jessica chastain too delivered good performance as the adult murph casey affleck s negative shaded tom and matt damons extended cameo appearance as drmann were also interesting the two robotic characters tars and case too had equal importance in the story line tars will surely be remembered as one of the best robotic characters of all time music by hans zimmer and camera works by hoyte van hoytema makes nolans simple approach to the complex theme successful zimmer offered s matching the mood of the film in fact certain scenes were too silent to be enjoyed could have made better cinematography by hoytema was a work of wonder nolan didnt use any great graphics or anything he used limited amount of visual effects concentrating more on the subject so this film will be a better experience for the ones who believe that content of the film is more important than visual effects interstellar is more of an experience than a film missing this film on big screen will end in deep regression special note to the ones who are going for this film in this film explorers are seen rotating their space ship usual audience may not be able to understand the theory behind it ie the creation of artificial gravity there are many such moments in the film which are related to deeper physics so before watching the film just go through the topics such as artificial gravity wormholes neutron star relativity time dilation and tesseract an idea about these topic make the interstellar experience an easier one i will be able to understand the film completely only after watching it again i am fully satisfied with this experience i will be a able to rate this film only after watching it again in this universe there

soorajintersellar what christopher nolan has done so good with this movie was that he kept the plot simplebut we know that its christopher nolan so it not going to be a simple movie its not the overall plot is that the earth is dying so coopermatthew mcconaughey and a team of scientists must go and find another place to live the acting is greatwhat makes it so great is cooper and his daughter every time they were together it was wow the visuals were on another level if you cansee it on the biggest screen possible some people may not like this movie because it talks a lot about science and many other things but you enjoy that you will have a blast with thisoverall interstellar is a must see i think it was nolans best filmintense dark and terrified what a wonderful film based on comic character that has been one of the favorite hero for child for almost half centuries. this film is produced for them that grew up nowadays not for child today. what a wonderful cast on both hero and villain that gives us very intricate and attractive characters which all of them are both shed partially obviously traits and also hid some shade in shadow. great story telling and very nice concept that play with heros dilemma. provoke on ethical concept even on those folk on film and us in front of the screen. the best part of the film is joker by heath ledger.......insurgent picks up shortly after the events in divergent with obvious intentions to maintain if not speed up the momentum of the franchise theres no doubt how fascinating the divergent universe is and while it

im not going to give a plot synopsis of this film because im sure everybody else who has commented on it has. however i will express the positive effect it can have on the viewer if they let it. the acting is uncommonly magnificent. morgan freeman delivers the greatest performance of his brilliant career as the seasoned life-serving prisoner ellis boyd red redding tim robbins holds his own against freeman as andy the central character james whitmores portrayal of the institutionalized brooks provides the backbone of the story bob gunton is wonderful as the corrupt warden norton and clancy browns commanding performance as captain hadley the sadistic head prison guard almost makes him steal the show from freeman. frank darabonts restrained direction of the delicate story is critical for the film to not become sentimental or clichÍ©d and his beautiful adaptation of the stephen king story on which the movie is based is a real breath of fresh air. on account of darabont the film shows that special effects are not needed to tell a great story in film. as a 17-year-old male i love special effects movies as much as the next person but they get boring after a while. plus many people forget that there was a time in cinema when the blockbuster didnt exist when they made movies that just told great stories and gave the audience a chance to be uplifted by those stories without the creators having to resort to special effects. i applaud you for having the guts to make a non-commercial film that reminds people of that in this day and age mr. darabont. spoiler alert as with all truly great films the shawshank redemption is full of scenes that have become entrenched in the publics collective consciousness. theres the scene where andy plays the opera record over the loudspeaker for all the inmates in the prison captain hadley bashing fat @$$ to death for crying during his first night in prison a very powerful scene red giving his rehabilitated speech to the board of parole officials the warden getting his final judgement and of course andy crawling to freedom through what red in his narration calls 500 yards of s**t-smelling foulness i cant even imagine the scene which for me is perhaps the greatest movie scene of the 90s. end of spoilers i thoroughly recommend this cinematic masterpiece which has earned its place in my humble top ten films of all time list to anybody. whatever gender age religion nationality etc. you are and whatever language you speak i guarantee it will change your life or perhaps even save it. movies like the shawshank redemption only come along once every decade if that. unforgettable. 10/10.in this quentin tarrantino written/directed film it follows three storys set over a few days and all collide together. warning i have given away lots of the story here so dont read on if you dont want to know the first story is where vincent vega john travolta who has just returned from amsterdam is escorting his boss marcellus wallaces ving rhames wife mia uma thurman out to dinner. followed by a twist dance an overdose at a drug dearlers house eric stoltz is the first story. the second story starts with a young child being told an amusing story by captain koons christopher walken about a gold watch the young child grows up to be butch coolige bruce willis who we see being bribed to go down in the fight earlier on he of course doesnt and gets invoved in a car accident a shoot out and being raped by z peter green along with marcellus. in the third story which is my favourite we return to where two hitmen vega and jules samuel l jackson shoot dead some gangsters have a mirical happen to them and have to dispose of a dead body in the back seat of a car with the help of jimmy tarrantino and mr wolf harvey keitel. they then at breakfast all this happens at around 8-10am have to deal with two resterauant robbers tim roth and amanda plummer who we see discussing robbing the resteraunt at the beggining of the movie. all in all a fabulous movie which is very confusing and you can get something new out of the movie each time. 11/10 its that goodin this movie a man is mistakenly accused in murdering his wife and her boyfriend. he ends up finding away to keep himself occupy and finally helps out his new found friend. i really like this movie because it does show you that the system can make a mistake just like everyone can. all people make mistakes and since the government is run by humans of course there are going to be flaws. i had watched this movie for the first time with my dad and i loved watching it since. it does show that when you are determined you can do anything you put your mind to. i think anyone who likes movies about prison or even about the judicial system will love this film.in this final extremely satisfying installment of `the lord of the rings trilogy peter jackson confirms himself as the cecil b. demille of our time a master purveyor of entertainment and showmanship with superior storytelling skills. jackson throughout has set out to make his own movies and not become a slave to j.r.r. tolkiens books awful as they are--i couldnt make it through the last one and this episode particularly benefits from his cinematic vision and the refitting by the writers who in addition to jackson include fran walsh and phillipa boyens of major plot points and the deepening of the character motivation so sorely lacking in tolkiens prosein these times where an every man for himself mentality prevails and ones self worth is measured by possessions this movie reminds us that the escalating fear that we all have as this country spirals out of control is best abated by having someone you can call a true friend. as time passes and more of us see that this country is heading inexorably toward social political and economic disaster this movie will find an even larger audience of devotees. perhaps one day we will abandon our materialism and discover that true hope which we will desperately need and a major theme of this movie lies in our relationships with others. until then we will have the shawshank redemption to remind us what real friendship looks like.in the far western reaches of south west wales i was lucky to be born to a father who had immaculate taste in film. at the tender age of 14 when i started to understand the complexity of human emotion i was introduced to this beautiful film. i remember the first time i sat and viewed the film my father put the vhs in the video player and left me alone to begin my relationship with this film from the age of 14 i reckon i must have watched this old film twice a year since and every time i still think this is probably the best film i have ever seen. just thought id express a little of how i feel about this film hope you dont mind. alin the amazingly beautiful way quentin makes this film come to life its hard to say this isnt one of the greatest films of all time. its beautifully written and the musical  is absolutely perfect. in his stylish way of filmmaking he seems to make his audience feel as if they are actually there and leaves you wanting more. if this film was three more hours long i would love it even more. there isnt a dull moment throughout the film and not even the slightest moment of boring or not appealing themes or moments. its non stop beauty and amazement from start to finish. you couldnt ask for a better movie going experience and this film will remain a classic for decades to come from audiences all around the world. pulp fiction is the kind of movie you and your friends and family talk about and quote endlessly for years to comein short this film is nothing short of amazing beautifully shot witty writing and with angelina jolies impeccable acting skills this film was always going to be a hit it is truly magical  everything you dreamed of once playing off with the fairies in the imaginary worldof childhood if your looking for a film that gives a sense of escapism this is it angelina is truly underrated whilst the makeup and costume add to the power of her character it is the true aura of herself that brings maleficent to life only she could give the character a true malevolence yet be heart breaking at the same time you really end up feeling for her and realise perhaps all is not always as it seems i would definitely recommend to anyone that is debating watching this film  who knows you may just find your wingsin short supply are the movies which act as cathartic catalysts on a second _„_or-plus viewing as compellingly and strongly as on the first viewing. the other night overpowered by feelings of despondency and ennui i went to flick through my small collection of movies and on an impulse i picked up the shawshank redemption. i savored every moment of the movie even more than my first time a couple of years ago. i chalk it up to its beautifully crafted story its virtuoso and powerhouse performances and its underlying themes of hope resolve and ultimate salvation. this time in his feature directorial debut frank darabont has tapped into the wellspring of king the horribles and fashioned a juggernaut of a prison drama out of his novella rita hayworth and the shawshank redemption. this movie stands out among other prison flicks in that it flies in the face of conventions. contrary to our expectations and cheapened tastes shawshank does not intend to explore the horrors of prison life as its fulcrum but the way its inhabitants clutch at straws and pull out all stops to extricate themselves from the shackles of the gloom of their claustrophobic mental incarceration against all the odds turns out to be its thematic pull. and the movie pulls it off big time. among a mosaic of characters events shenanigans and skullduggery the movie mainly delves into the friendship struck up between two lifers. the friendship between andy dufresne played convincingly by tim robbins who is accused of murdering his wife and her lover and sentenced to serve two concurrent lives and the veteran red the brilliant morgan freeman carries the emotional and inspirational mood of the movie. when a busload of prisoners arrive at the max-security state penitentiary of shawshank the other felons bet on who is going to burst into tears at the first night of prison life. red ups his antes on the seemingly brittle fresh fish andy who was a respectable banker in the outside and is like a fish out of water among a bunch of thick-skinned miscreants. red loses since andy turns out to be more redoubtable and impermeable than any prison wall several feet thick. little do the fellow prisoners realize at first glance what an enigmatic character he is. for the first months he says next to nothing meanders through other prisoners in the prison yard minding his own business and the movie speaks through by-turn humorous poignant and thought-provoking narration of the omniscient red who is known for smuggling things in and charging a 20% markup for the services he provides. however reds omniscience is not all-encompassing and godly enough to bore into the sphinx-like mind of the introverted andy even after 19 years. on a tarring occasion he overhears a guard complaining about the taxes he has to pay for an inheritance he screws up his courage to offer him his expert advice on tax evasion. now he is treated as a special guest since he cooks the books for the prisons powers that be who have hit pay dirt. his financial legerdemain proves to be a double-edged sword. now he is the victim of his own success. a newcomer is willing to testify to his innocence in the court but the warden regards his accountant too valuable to be expendable. andy survives several assaults and rapes. he never gives up. he never cracks under pressure. life is very simple to him: get busy living or get busy dying. he makes the first choice and remains true to it through thick and thin. he lives with hope as his source of salvation. the emotional pull of the movie owes a great deal to the spirited and flawless performances of all the cast members. morgan freeman effortlessly inhabits his character as a real free man. tim robbins is superlative as a quintessential embodiment of hope and inspiration. james whitmore as the institutionalized prison trusty who is suicidal in the outside turns in a superlative performance. hats off to all the performers. the shawshank redemption is a prime example of the gap between the box office performance of a movie and its popularity. this movie famously bombed in the box office barely covering its budget. but overtime it gained in such popularity that it has snatched the coveted toppest ranking place in imdb from such hot favorites and topdogs like godfather forrest gump and pulp fiction the last two of which eclipsed shawshank in 1994 academy awards. perhaps in 1994 the movie lacked the requisite word of mouth that it is enjoying now. all in all shawshank is a compulsively watchable movie with bits of pleasure withheld in every watching only to be relished on next occasions.in pulp fiction quentin tarantino uses completely original characters in a plot so original and spellbinding that the final result is th greatest film of all time. the way he is able to separate the plot into vignettes is brilliant. additionally the hidden imagery adds to the overall depth of the movie.in one word - unbelievable but i will not stop at just one word. this film is as close to flawless as i have ever seen and on top of that it sets a new standard just as its predecessor did for the superhero film. lets start with the technical aspects: visual effects - the visual effects are simply mind - blowing the action moves seamlessly through the city. with even the most impossible things brought back to sheer realism. it shifts with ease between the normal and i - max camera shots. the truck jacknife scene that includes the the batpod is especially thrilling. directinng and scriptwriting - christopher nolan directs with the hand of a cinematic master effortlessly blending action romance humor and drama. the writing from christopher and his brother john is fantastic giving depth to all the characters and bringing in character growth that goes beyond the conventions of a superhero film. now that this has been handled lets go to the acting all of the actors deliver stellar performances bringing the struggles of the characters to full realisation but the star of the show has to be heath ledger in a wonderfully chilling and menacingly insane performance losing him was such a loss to the film industry. so for a thrilling and exhausting masterpiece do not look any further than the dark knight.in my top ten list this resides happily at #2. christopher nolan is known for giving the batman films new life with his amazing first film. with the sequel he blew me and everybody else away with a good story amazing action and top notch performances by all. i consider the opening bank heist car chase and the conversation between batman and joker to be three of the best scenes ever made in history. i will not be saying anything new when i mention the scale of heath ledgers performance as the joker. many will say that nicholson was the best. while i do admire nicholson i personally think that heaths performance was nowhere in the same ballpark as nicholsons. this is a batman masterpiece and nolan def. knows how to please an audience. i have never heard the kind of applause that i heard after the movie ended when i saw it. everyone cheered because it was just so great. the dark knight can never be duplicated. while it is sad that this role led to ledgers death he left in the highest point of his life. i couldnt be more proud of him. a lot and i mean a lot of people complain about the batman voice. i liked the voice that christian did. the most important factor of batman is that he be distinctly different than bruce wayne. in the past the other batmans have had relatively the same voice as bruce wayne. in this film the voice is strong and aggressive. there were two occasions that i didnt understand him but after watching multiple times i figured it out. after watching the movie i did have a few minor gripes like a wish the fight between the two had been better and that they had put two face in the next movie instead of him being in for the last half hour but i got over it and dont care anymore because the fact is that this movie is just down right f**king awesome and should not be missed by any fan of batman.in my opinion this is the one movie that is absolutely the greatest the first time you watch it. its probably my favorite movie. it may not have the replay value of some of my other favorites but the first time you watch it when you dont know what is about to happen is the probably the greatest thing you can experience in terms of movies. i only wish could i forget it so i could watch it again for the first time. as a matter of fact if i ever suffered complete amnesia there would be at least one definite benefit. i am not going to talk about the ending and for gods sake if anybody puts a spoiler warning on their comments do not read themin my opinion these one of the best film of ever. the reason is obviously the story: tolkien is a master in telling adventures and this is his masterpiecein my opinion its better than the ordinary monte cristo story that we all know as the greatest escape tale  so this time the escape is greater and the hero is an ordinary man  who is so patient and hopeful while you watch the first few minutes of the film you may think that its social or silly story but minute by minute you will recognize that you were wrong its a brilliant storya never seen before  a very powerful drama .. the best thing in that movie was the relations between characterslike hatingand true friendship like the one which was between tim robins and morgan freeman i like this movie and i advice every one on the planet to watch it as soon as possible....in my opinion i believe this movie was an epic tail of a boy whos parents were murdered by a thug. until one day the boy decided to take action and soon became the protagonist in this movie also would be known as batman.our hero the dark night tends to protect the civilians of gothem city from his worst enemies and other so forth criminals. the antagonist is an evil but smart man named bane. bane and his army tend to defeat batman and take over the city but batman does not allow it and an epic battle is created with many detail and quality. i would highly recommend this film to all viewers who are dc comic fans of dc movie watchers. but if you just want action and adventure this is the movie for all of you viewers.  even though in a way it is not entirely unexpected. it is particularly enlivened by the presence of morgan freeman who should have won an oscar for his voice-overs alone. in a word exceptional. in my humble opinion the greatest comic book film ever made. to start heath ledger made the film. his performance as the joker was one of the greatest performances ever given which is made even more amazing by the fact that just by looking at him or the films he has done where he is the pretty hero you would never see him as this iconic villain. he got the right balance of creepy psychopathic and at times funny making it the best performance of the joker in history. it was a shame when he passed and that he never received the oscar himself that he most definitely deserved but at least he as a man who took pride in his work left behind a performance and a legacy that many actors could only dream of. aaron eckhart was awesome as harvey dent/two-face as well. the turn from being the white knight cop to the murdering two-face was not an easy one to do and i dont think many actors would have got it right but eckhart did and was very convincing as dent. the returning cast bale caine freeman oldman etc. where fantastic particularly bale who had to take on a new stage in batmans life where he is now an established protector of gotham but now must put his own codes and rules when facing his greatest foe. the music was awesome and hans zimmer as well as his team have really gone out of their way to create a batman theme that i believe is as iconic as john williams superman theme. christopher nolan redeemed the batman franchise with batman begins and took it to new heights with this masterpiece the dark knight you will all just have to wait and see where the franchise ended with the final chapter the dark knight rises. the dark knight is not only the best film in nolans batman franchise but also the best comic book based film ever.  not just for characters in a movie but for a better life and a better world for all of us. 10/10 in its oscar year shawshank redemption written and directed by frank darabont after the novella rita hayworth and the shawshank redemption by stephen king was nominated for seven academy awards and walked away with zero. best picture went to forrest gump while shawshank and pulp fiction were just happy to be nominated. of course hindsight is 20/20 but while history looks back on gump as a good film pulp and redemption are remembered as some of the all-time best. pulp however was a success from the word go making a huge splash at cannes and making its writer-director an american master after only two films. for andy dufresne and co. success didnt come easy. fortunately failure wasnt a life sentence. after opening on 33 screens with take of $727327 the $25m film fell fast from theatres and finished with a mere $28.3m. the reasons for failure are many. firstly the title is a clunker. while iconic to fans today in 1994 people knew not and cared not what a shawshank was. on the dvd tim robbins laughs recounting fans congratulating him on that rickshaw movie. marketing-wise the films a nightmare as prison drama is a tough sell to women and the story of love between two best friends doesnt spell winner to men. worst of all the movie is slow as molasses. as desson thomson writes for the washington post it wanders down subplots at every opportunity and ignores an abundance of narrative exit points before settling on its finale. but it is these same weaknesses that make the film so strong. firstly its setting. the opening aerial shots of the prison are a total eye-opener. this is an amazing piece of architecture strong and gothic in design. immediately the prison becomes a character. it casts its shadow over most of the film its tall stone walls stretching above every shot. it towers over the men it contains blotting out all memories of the outside world. only andy robbins holds onto hope. its in music its in the sandy beaches of zihuatanejoin guardians of the galaxy we have peter quill chris pratt a scavenger that was picked up from earth as a young boy locating an orb that contains one of the infinity stones while on nova he gets in a fight with gamora zoe saldana for the stone meanwhile rocket and groot bradley cooper and vin diesel are trying to capture quill they are all arrested and sent to the kyln prison where they meet up with another inmate drax dave bautista they may fight and bicker but they come together as a team and a family to defeat ronan lee pace before be can destroy nova this leads us to the theme of the movie teamwork the first time they work as a team is when break out of the kyln they all gathered the items that rocket needed to break them out even though they worked as a team they still hadnt gelled together yet that came at the end of the movie during the battle with ronan if this theme sounds familiar to you it should it took place two years earlier on earth when nick fury samuel l jackson brought together a group of extraordinary superheroes called the avengers it can also be found in the fantastic four from 2005 and the league of extraordinary gentlemen in 2003 a technique that we saw used during the film to show the development of the theme was developing characters this is the most evident with draxs character when he is introduced in the kyln he is all about revenge and killing gamora the change in drax happens on nowhere when groot saves him from drowning when ronan throws him in a vat of liquid the development finalizes on ronans ship the dark aster when they are walking to the bridge and he realizes that the rest of the guardians are his friends another technique used during the film is ensemble acting while all five of the guardians have different backgrounds and came from different places they all have different skills that help out the team for example rocket is very good with building weapons for the team to use while gamora can use her intellect and military training like i mentioned the theme is teamwork like loki tom hiddleston for the avengers and professor m in the league of extraordinary gentlemen richard roxburgh the guardians used a common cause to bring them together that was ronan in this film they now have a bond that will serve them well against other foesin every trilogy the third was not the strongest mostly the first sometimes the second. but in the lotr its the third film that is the best the strongest and the greatest one. a terrific climax and a beautiful ending. but it was sad because there will be no lotr next year:-. everything that has a beginning has an end. in my comment for matrix revolutions i said that the matrix failed where lotr will succeed. ive never been so right in my whole life. the movie is one whole thrill. 3 hours and of suspense darkness and despair and the resting 20 minutes were just beautiful and gave the movie a perfect ending. but there is always hope a light at the end of the tunnel. the special effects were the best ever. the battle in minas tirith the battle at the black gate and the fight between frodo sam and shelob. matrix reloaded and revolutions were also breathtaking but they overwhelmed the characters the characters in lotr stay strong and stronger than ever especially aragorn sam gollum and frodo. i watched the movie twice and there were two scenes that made my flesh creep the rohirrim attacking the orcs and a silent shelob behind frodo really spooky. the battle and the nature of good and evil have never been so deep amazing and beautiful as before. but i was totally satisfied at the end where sam says his last line. the last line in the film was the same last line as in the book. then i went back to my home never been so happy. 10/10  he totally rocked in the previous films. telling us to wait for the extended version isnt right. maybe jackson should have foregone one of the too many endings in rotk to give lee some film time. that said all the elements that worked in the previous movies were absolutely glorious in this film. the one new thing that i would add to so much that has already been written is that big kudos must go to the great tolkien artists alan lee and john howe whose artistry shaped so much of the imagery from the first moments of fotr to the final scenes of rotk. this historic trilogy would not have been the same without them. the lotr enterprise has clearly been a great labor of love from all who worked on it over the years and this final installment was a crowning achievement in an era when filmmakers of mediocre ability can get financing to do grunge slash thrillers or sex-pie college comedies of farrelly-manque nonsense this poll serves to illustrate the gratitude of fans everywhere at being served such a luscious 9 course meal of a film. or 3 of them. at the directors own insistence the writing the production the editing the art design the sound planning the actors/characters the costumes the music the effects. everything was delivered until the limits almost gave. none of these and all of them are the stars. to say this vote reflects only appreciation of the special effects is to disingenuously shoulder aside the leadership and dedication and commitment from all teams required to produce not just one but all three films to such incredible standards of consistency to the books while pleasing worldwide fans and new audiences as well as all ages. schindlers list was not spielbergs story by authorship any more than tolkiens was jacksons both borrowed a cultural event one historical one literary story to exploit on the big screen using the appropriate talent. thats what filmmakers do. and if theyre smart they get the right material. i dont think spielberg could have delivered lotr. but i have a funny feeling pj might have come close to sl. both proved their genius by traveling outside their closest strength positions and moved to new arenas. both borrowed from past projects and knowledge of film to create the dramatic impacts they engineered in those films.you cannot say because one was historically based then it was by that ilk superior. schindlers list may be the most sociologically impactful movie ever made but it was not the best. there was exploitation and the nazis character was colored fancifully and schindler was not the spitting image of liam neesam etc etc. you can read history without the women prostituting themselves and children lying in outhouse filth. spielberg made the same kinds of decisions making that movie jackson did making rings but each used special effects of a different kind. did naziism happen in black and white that anyone would seek to disprove rings popularity by citing the more proximate and non-disputed sociological consciousness raised by sl is gaging on the wrong scale. i would not pay to see sl again once as enough. but ive paid a dozen times x3and for the extended dvds to relive tolkiens world because like those characters i believe theres something good in this world worth fighting for. and jacksons world gives me and others a place to go to encourage us. the films are about hope. wasnt that the message from schindler as wellin 2003 lord of the rings- return of the king won top honors at nearly every major award ceremony and set a new record for box-office receipts one that would stand for six years. it blew audiences away with its epic storytelling and scale surpassing even the previous two entries in the trilogy. it was a truly great film. and now with the extended version its even better than before. the reason why return of the king is so great is threefold. first its based on one of the twentieth centurys greatest works of literature. secondly director peter jackson has remained true to source material leaving as much as possible intact. and lastly this project saw a near unprecedented infusion of talent and money. from the director to the extremely large cast to the effects wizards at weta everyone knew what they were doing and gave it their very best. nothing was held back no expense spared and no detail overlooked and the result is pure awesomeness. one of tolkiens greatest talents as a writer was his ability to fill his worlds with a host of distinct interesting characters each with their own strengths weaknesses and struggles. jackson has included nearly all and through them explores myriad themes. in aragorn vigo mortenson we see a man who overcome his self-doubt and accept the mantle of greatness that he was meant to wear. hes also the embodiment of true courage being brave or perhaps crazy enough to pick up the seeing stone and tell sauron here i am come and get me. in frodo elijah wood the story explores how even the most ordinary of people can accomplish great things but also how even the purest can be tempted by power and corrupted by evil. one figure who cannot be corrupted however is samwise gamgee who represents perhaps the ultimate example of friendship and loyalty sharing every hardship remaining ever vigilant against gollums treachery and the rings corruption and braving a giant spider and a fortress of orcs to rescue his friend even after he had turned on him. even the relatively minor characters are well drawn and add to the story. take pippin and merry. theyre just a couple of goof-offs the friends who are just along for the ride. but before the story is done both will play important roles in the greatest battle of the age. aeowen for her part embodies both duty to ones people and the the pain of unrequited love. and legalos and gimli though largely relegated to sidekick duty still show how friendship can transcend racial boundaries and old grudges. but the most interesting character of all must surely be gollum. twisted physically and mentally and with a severe case of split personality he hates his very existence and he hates the ring for what its done to him but he desires to possess it even more. hes like a schizoid drug addict- a violent yet often hilarious schizoid drug addict. its amazing how quickly he can go from playful and comical to pure venom. and no-one does a more unsettling conversation with himself. hes murderous hes repulsive hes pitiful and hes one of the most interesting characters in twentieth century literature. of course this isnt all internal struggles and character development  just made for a perfect ending. through all the movies you see the characters go from complete strangers and in some cases enemies to close friends. only the strongest friendships are formed in the toughest of situations. this series shows that perfectly. to see the struggles and the victories brought to life so well is amazing. i would definitely recommend this and all the other lord of the rings or the hobbit movies to any fantasy movie lovers. in 1995 when i was fourteen out of the blue i saw in a newspaper that one of my favorite stephen king stories rita hayworth and the shawshank redemption had finally made its way to the silver screen. it wasnt showing at the hoyts/greater union cinemas rather a local independent/art-house cinema. of course that didnt bother me so i went. over 2hours long shawshank swept you into another world. stephen kings short-novel was very faithfully adapted. three pieces of brilliance stood out then and still do today. 1 first the film was brilliantly paced never a dull moment. having read the short-novel before hand didnt diminish any expectations. 2 second a brilliant cast. sheer brilliance from morgan freeman and tim robbins as red and andy dufresne. very strong supporting cast in bob gunton - the cruel warden sam norton other inmates: gill bellows as young tommy williams james whitmore the elderly brooks brilliant expansion of character that short novel only dealt with in two paragraphs. yet the show was stolen by clancy brown. browns legendary performance as captain bryon hadley one guy you clearly didnt want on your case 3 finally what remains in my mind the most from reds last parole-hearing to the end of the film. words cant simply convey the emotions this was what i didnt except. it was so powerfully done. my favorite quote: andy dufresne: get busy living or get busy dying.  enough said.in 1947 banker andy dufresne tim robbins is convicted of murdering his wife and her lover based on circumstantial evidence and is sentenced to two consecutive life sentences at shawshank state penitentiary. andy quickly befriends contraband smuggler ellis red redding morgan freeman an inmate serving a life sentence. red procures a rock hammer for andy allowing him to create small stone chess pieces. red later gets him a large poster of rita hayworth followed in later years by images of marilyn monroe and raquel welch. andy works in the prison laundry but is regularly assaulted by the bull queer gang the sisters and their leader bogs mark rolston. in 1949 andy overhears the brutal chief guard byron hadley clancy brown complaining about taxes on a forthcoming inheritance and informs him about a financial loophole. after another vicious assault by the sisters nearly kills andy hadley severely beats bogs resulting in bogs being sent to another prison. andy is not attacked again. warden samuel norton bob gunton meets with andy and reassigns him to the prison library to assist elderly inmate brooks hatlen james whitmore a pretext for andy to manage financial duties for the prison. his advice and expertise are soon sought by other guards at shawshank and from nearby prisons. andy begins writing weekly letters to the state government for funds to improve the decrepit library. in 1954 brooks is freed on parole but unable to adjust to the outside world after 50 years in prison he hangs himself. andy receives a library donation that includes a recording of the marriage of figaro. he plays an excerpt over the public address system resulting in his receiving solitary confinement. after his release andy explains that he holds onto hope as something that the prison cannot take from him but red dismisses the idea. in 1963 norton begins exploiting prison labor for public works profiting by undercutting skilled labor costs and receiving kickbacks. he has andy launder the money using the alias randall stephens. in 1965 tommy williams gil bellows is incarcerated for burglary. he joins andys and reds circle of friends and andy helps him pass his general educational development g.e.d. examinations. in 1966 after hearing the details of andys case tommy reveals that an inmate at another prison claimed responsibility for an identical murder suggesting andys innocence. andy approaches norton with this information but the warden refuses to listen. norton places andy in solitary confinement and has hadley murder tommy under the guise of an escape attempt. andy refuses to continue with the scam but norton threatens to destroy the library and take away his protection and preferential treatment. after andy is released from solitary confinement he tells red of his dream of living in zihuatanejo a mexican pacific coastal town. while red shrugs it off as being unrealistic andy instructs him should he ever be freed to visit a specific hayfield near buxton to retrieve a package. the next day at roll call upon finding andys cell empty an irate norton throws one of andys rocks at the poster of raquel welch hanging on the wall. the rock tears through the poster revealing a tunnel that andy had dug with his rock hammer over the previous two decades. the previous night andy escaped through the tunnel and the prisons sewage pipe with nortons ledger containing details of the money laundering. while guards search for him the following morning andy posing as randall stephens visits several banks to withdraw the laundered money. finally he sends the ledger and evidence of the corruption and murders at shawshank to a local newspaper. the police arrive at shawshank and take hadley into custody while norton commits suicide to avoid arrest. after serving 40 years red receives parole. he struggles to adapt to life outside prison and fears he never will. remembering his promise to andy he visits buxton and finds a cache containing money and a letter asking him to come to zihuatanejo. red violates his parole and travels to fort hancock texas to cross the border to mexico admitting he finally feels hope. on a beach in zihuatanejo he finds andy and the two friends are happily reunited.in 1947 andy dufresne vice president of a bank in portland is accused of killing his wife and lover of this a famous golfer and sentenced to life imprisonment for each although no conclusive evidence of authorship  being sent to shawshank. he is above the average of others who believe a snob though red one of the most popular men prisoners get to ask everything you like and soon become friends which does not relieve you of fall into the hands of sisters about homosexuals who do not leave you alone. red lends a hand and you choose to fix a roof outside the prison. there listens andy financial problems of a guardian and offers to save. that makes his fame transcends and in a few years made the statements of all of his prison guards and other county. it also serves to definitely get rid of your stalkers of concern to guard. he also placed in charge of the prison library where you write a letter every week to the senate for funds to it with its insistence getting the best prison library in all of new england. but see also the despair inside having spent his entire life in prison does not want to go outside where everything is hostile to them. the old brooks former manager of the library outside is nothing and commits suicide. he has a special treatment to keep the accounts of the corrupt warden that prisoners performing work with which anyone can compete and companies who want to work you must pay a hefty commission that andy becomes white money inventing a fictitious character where even get legal papers. andy is also responsible for helping those who wish to study including tommy a boy who wants to change his life. thanks to him tommy manages to get the graduate. and is the guy who tells him that in one of the prisons in which he was matched with a guy who told her he had killed a golfer and his mistress and the fact that her husband accused her. andy sees in confession a glimmer of hope which is truncated by the warden that does not help and ends with the only thread of hope making kill tommy. andy himself will spend two months in solitary confinement for refusing to follow accounting warden. the output will return to it but that night disappears from his cell without anyone knowing what happened to him until they discover a tunnel after a large poster of raquel welch. and once outside the bank will draw up character warden $ 300000 in addition to sending a letter with proof of corruption all the press. norton commits suicide. some time later after 40 years in prison is released network for him life on the outside is as absurd as to brooks and think back to crime to return to their home. it only holds a promise i made to andy that he would go to a field where there was something for him. he does and finds enough money to go to the place where andy said that if one day be installed leaving a mexican village by the pacific where a hotel ride. red goes there to be his assistant. great movie you see them.imdb top 250: 12 the lord of the rings: return of the king is an incredible conclusion to the trilogy a masterpiece of its genre and a fantastic film. it wraps up everything and has the biggest most grand epic battle ever. if youve seen the first two films and just havent found time for the third go make time and reward yourself four 3 and a half hours. the opening scene came completely out of left field and left me thinking. it shows how smeagol came to acquire the ring and the power it instantly had over him. we also see what the mad creature looked like before he was well gollum. its a great flashback like a lost flashback and lets us learn about of the most interesting characters in the mythology. then like a good conclusion there is buildup. the characters reunite and realize that this is it the final battle. at the same time frodo and sam begin to near the end of their journey and their scenes actually serve a purpose. we see the black gate and the emergence of saurons army with the too-cool witch king. we watch the seaside town by gondor fall easily and later a grisly part involving catapults and heads that seemed just a tad too mature but reminds the viewer the ferocity and primitive nature of the orcs. in a grand montage the beacons are lit signalling rohan to aid. during this aragorn legolas and gimli go to find aid from elsewhere. the stage is set for a huge battle. and what a battle it is. other than the mines this is easily the single greatest scene in the trilogy. it takes up a good chunk of the film. the scale and visual realization is unrivalled. the elephants complete the scene as well as the witch kings fate. its spellbinding. the ring finally taking a toll on frodo nears mount doom. while the giant war is a massive battle the ring quest is a small battle. frodo tragically has degenerated with sam having to push him to the end. the scene inside the volcano is amazing as well as frodos line. these two plots are interwoven and create the most remarkable fantasy ever on screen. after all is said and done we are treated to a bittersweet epilogue showing what happens to the characters giving good closure. return of the king is a stunning film worthy of its oscar glory and critical praise. ill let the number speak for itself. 9.6/10im writing this purely for being able to cross it off my profile checklist that i havent done in about 2 years im pretty sure everyone as seen or at least heard that this one of the greatest movies of all time so im not going to get into all that it sure is one of mine all right i tried to submit it but it wouldnt accept it without 10 lines so bear with me here i really really really really love this movie yes that got me to the next line so i would definitely recommend it to anyone if you havent seen it go watch it now you wont be disappointed thanks for readingim trying to save you moneyim sure theres no doubt about it that this quentin tarantino masterpiece is the best film of the decade and one of the best films ever original funny bloody disgusting this film has left everyone shocked its incredible and originally written plot is the key of the films succes and thats what people like about it this is a 9 out of 10 movie you dont have to use the 10 you never know what is going to come nextim sure everyone has covered the obvious genius of this movie so im just going to write about the little things i enjoy im sure many people love to see this movie over and over again but since i have so many things memorized as all of you im sure dont lie i like to space it out and look at it in a fresh way each time too bad it can never be as fresh as the first time but the exhiliration and thrill is still there its so cool how tarantino can put everything he loves about cult movies and throw in some very spicy international women into the brew not to mention surf guitar and cartoon homages and present ethnic slurs in such an inoffensive way that it shows the whole inanity and ridiculousness of it all i also like how quentin puts little things that you can catch brand new after 20 or so viewings you might not have noticed or even have cared for that matter but in almost every scene theres a little thing going sometimes on the edge of the screen that makes this more than a hip ultraviolent cult fave i like how the scene involving christopher walken and the young butch walken almost changes every word in explaining butchs fathers death for the sake of butch and his mother also at the end if you pay attention to the extras in the resteraunt they look like real bystanders in a hold-up i also sometimes find myself asking questions about the characters and imagine them outside the movie like rosanna arquette and eric stoltz i always imagine them getting high and cheating on each other not to mention tarantino putting questions out there for us what is in that suitcase after allim so glad peter jackson adapted these brilliant books from jrr tolkien... a world in which we can escape as spectator and as actor too... thank you mr jackson  we can travel in middle earth through the beautiful work of the whole crew and those oscars were widely deserved. the hobbit trilogy is different but i trust peter jackson to finish it with wits and through the whole experience of those ten last years. im waiting to see there and back again though cause the end wont be easy to adapt. hopefully it should blow everyones mind  a mellon hobbit in modern times.im robbins plays andy dufresne a city banker wrongfully convicted of murdering his wife and her lover. he is sent to shawshank prison in 1947 and receives a double life sentence for the crime. andy forms an unlikely friendship with red morgan freeman the man who knows how to get things. andy faces many trials in prison but forms an alliance with the wardens because he is able to use his banking experience to help the corrupt officials amass personal fortunes. the story unfolds.... i was so impressed with how every single subplot was given a great deal of respect and attention from the director. the acting was world-class. i have never seen tim robbins act as well since morgan freeman maybe e.g. seven. the twists were unexpected an although this film had a familiar feel it wasnt even slightly pretentious or clichÍ©d it was original. the cinematography was grand and expressive. it gave a real impression of the sheer magnitude of this daunting prison.im really looking forward to the last film of the the dark knight trilogy the dark knight rises which will be released in this summer. so i reviewed batman begins and the dark knight. i was quite impressed by them. the story of batman begins is about the reason why bruce wayne became batman and the story of the dark knight is about overcoming adversity. but at the same time he lost a lot of things and became the dark knight. alfred a faithful butler of bruce wayne talked to bruce when bruce returned from his work as a batman with his injury. alfred: now your limit master wayne. bruce: batman has no limit. alfred: but you dosir. at this time bruce hadnt realized the fact that even batman had his limit. harvey dent a prosecutor believing in justice and bruce were fighting against the evil in gotham city together. harvey talked to the citizen of gotham city about hope. harvey: the night is darkest just before dawn. i promise you dawn is coming. they were heroes so they were bound by their morality. for example batman could never kill anyone. but their enemy joker was completely free from any rules. he could do anything and drove them into the corner. joker: im an agent of chaos. oh do you know about chaos its fear. bruce realized his inability and talked to alfred. bruce: what do i have to do alfred: endure master wayne. and then batman tried to wiretap all people in gotham city in order to find where joker was. batman: beautiful isnt it fox: beautiful unethical dangerous. this is wrong. in the end harvey dropped into his dark side like darth vader. joker: i took gothams white knight and i brought him to our level. it wasnt hard. madness as you know is like gravity. all i take is a little push. harvey: the world is cruel. the only morality in the cruel world is chance. batman dared to suffer the disgrace saving harveys honor as gothams white knight. at the end of the dark knight batman as a dark knight was chased by police. gordon: hes a silent guardian a watchful protector a dark knight. id like to talk a little about myself. when i was 20s and 30s i believed that i had no limit. if i had been serious i could do anything i thought. but in fact i was never so serious and i couldnt accomplish anything. after i have suffered from depression i realized that i had my own limit. i asked myself what i had to do and just endured my worthlessness. so i can understand how harvey and bruce felt. i myself can come back to our society. im looking forward to seeing how batman as a dark knight will get himself back in the dark knight rises.im not sure if this may contain any spoilers but before you read make sure you at least seen trailer spoilers this film is just brilliant the action emotional comedy lovevery entertaining this film will not bore you one bit youll enjoy every single part of the movie its that good acting was amazing so many new faces soundtrack was awesome storyline was perfect and action just takes it all besides the amazing fashion and style of this film very classy the suits gadgets everything is amazing stop reading reviews just watch this movie you will love it and wont regret it 1010im not going to waste your time by writing a long review. i have a couple of short words for you guys. this movie was truly amazing. i loved it from beginning to end. christopher nolan created the best batman there has been to date. heath ledger definitely made a amazing character. there has never been a better joker in all of history in my opinion. christian bale as the batman was the perfect. i loved it. the action sequences were so realistic that i actually thought batman could really exist. christopher nolan made this film very realistic indeed. everything in the movie seems possible in real life.im not going to sit here and go into a deep explanation of what this film is about because that has been thoroughly explained in many of the other reviews. what i will say is that the shawshank redemption is without any doubt the most amazing film ever written. the acting is tremendous the story is original and the movie itself has a deeper meaning to it. this movie is not about the hardships of prison it is about the importance of friendship and the realization that hope is your greatest aspect. this piece does not focus as much on andy and his great escape from shawshank but more on red finding that there is always meaning and a purpose for everything. the story really unfolds when brooks an old timer that andy and red had been close friends with is put on parole and released from prison. after confronting the outside world and knowing that he could not cope with it brooks finds that he has no purpose outside of life in jail and hangs himself. later in the movie after andy makes his great escape from prison red is finally released from shawshank himself and is put in the same situation as brooks. only one reason marks the fact that red himself didnt commit suicide. that reason is andy. red figures out that he does have a purpose outside of prison which is to see his best friend again and to give him a handshake. and as the movie comes to a marvelous ending that hope to see andy becomes a reality. overall the best movie i have ever watched and i am glad to say that i will continue to keep watching it again and again and again.im not going to give any clues to the plot this film needs to be seen without knowing the end its very rare that the entire audience remains silent and seated when the lights go up brilliantly acted  ben afleck and rosamund pike were superb they played 2 very complex characters incredibly well i found it very hard to feel biased towards either of the main characters which i think was intended the film is very pared down in how it was shot which enabled the viewer to completely concentrate on the characters there were admittedly some parts which were less believable but they didnt take away from the overall enjoyment i need to see this again and againim not going to explain the plot of this film. there is a plot but it doesnt matter. pulp fiction is a film with as much style as any film ive ever seen. the acting is fantastic career best for all. travolta is hilarious as vincent a dopey gangster. he just got back from amsterdam where they call a quarter pounder with cheese a royale with cheese. vincents partner is jules played by samuel l. jackson. jackson is hands down the best part of this film. hes charismatic quotable and unforgettable in his portrayal of jules. uma thurman also brings depth and charisma to a seemingly insignificant character. bruce willis is the best hes been also. admittedly i believe the script is so good it makes the performances seem better than they actually are. the music in the film is perfect very energetic. the visual style is gorgeous some of the best editing in any film ive seen. the cinematography is all so arresting. pulp fiction is noted for its nonlinear storytelling but its unfortunately also noted for some horrible ripoffs by no talent hacks. fun fact: tarantino always borrows from obscure movies he loves but he always makes the homages simple and insignificant to the story and characters.im not comic book fanatic dont read them at all. not even real batman fan... but still i can surely say this is the best movie i ever saw. the plot acting effects story soundtrack... everything is just perfect. the way you can make such non-serious stuff like comic book character in to really serious movie is simply the work of art which this movie really is. when i see better movie then this ill let everybody know about it. actors are all great for the roll. so sad about ledger. even tho hes not with us anymore after watching this movie i consider him the best actor of our time. hell the best actor of all times by my opinion. this role simply made him that.im not a wellknown film critic but this is my first film that i have gave a ten out of ten rating we all know that its that time of the year again for production companies to start pumping out their best material for the academy award season some companies think their is a system to putting together a great film other companies actually take the time to put together a great film crew and good actors this was one of those companies consider this film a headstart on david finchers race to an award for best director or best picture either one is fine everything about this film is almost perfect to the directing editing acting even the font for the creditsim not a disney fan i never cared for the princess themed films i never understood why the queen in snow white or maleficent in sleeping beauty were at all threatened in beauty or charm or intellect by the youth in each film this film is absolutely brilliant it finally shows a view that makes sense from a story telling stand point it shows the grace and charm of a character who is not a princess by title and it has a clear beginning middle and end for all motivation on the part of principle characters this might be one of the single best narrated film in the entire history of disney and perhaps of all time this might be the single best character actress performance by angelina jolie since gia or possibly of her entire career this cast might be the most simplistic yet perfect cast ever put together to tell a small story in a tremendously beautiful way with universal messages that cross all relationships i knew i would appreciate jolie on the big screen what i didnt know is that the story is by its telling in this film now a classic story anything including the original animated version pales by comparison i cant say its the greatest film ive seen or the best this year or any of those things because it can not be put into any of those categories nor compared to any other film this film in some way i believe simply by the story itself and how it is told stands apart from any film ive seen in quite possibly decades i saw it went out to the box office got another ticket and saw it again and i plan to see it again if possible i saw the 2d version i am not a 3d or imax person and i am not a fan of bluray but this film needs to be seen in any and all formats if you thought the lord of the rings films or the hobbit films were beautifully done they cant even be compared to the telling of this tale maleficent might be the most brilliantly told story ive seen in my entire life and ive seen many many films in many genres i want to read it as it is told in the film and i think in the telling this version is the only version need ever be told absolutely magnificent im spellboundim just gonna start off by saying i love this movie.its one of my favorites of all time. i honestly cant think of too much wrong with this movie other than its a little long and batmans by now infamous voice. but everything else is top notch. the actingstoryatmosphereand actions scenes are all amazing. if you havent seen this movie see it right now i went into this not expecting to much but i came out blown away i cant imagine any movie being much better. ill just have to wait for the dark knight rises to release to see if anything can be better. until then this stands as the best movie ive ever seenim in my 20s and its been a long time since ive actually enjoyed watching a fairytale cinderella helped me fall in love with fairy tales again i actually think that now as an adult i can appreciate fairy tales more than when i was a kid what i love most about the movie is that it promotes kindness and courage which may sound clich but in the movie we see that kindness attracts the right kind of people without kindness cinderella would have never attracted the prince that first day in the forest and she would have never attracted the fairy godmother if cinderella had become bitter and angry like her stepmother and stepsisters she would have not only made herself no better than them but she would have pushed away the prince and the fairy godmother and her life probably would have stayed the same or even worse she may have ended up just like her stepmother and step sisters i never realized it before but cinderella is more of a story about kindness and forgiveness although it is a romantic story too i think the romance element of the story is not the most important part of this storyim in my 20s and its been a long time since ive

female actor patricia arquette best male supporting actor ethan hawke go see it and if its not in theaters when you read this buy the dvd you will not regret it truly the best motion picture of this year and probably this decade dont waste your time and money on all the big motion pictures with all the special effects and glitz and hype this is the movie to seeim going to be honest about this i like unabashedly violent action films im 42 years old im from texas and i can take it growing up with films like rambo die hard the terminator and robocop i cant stand that watereddown nobloodnoswearing gutless kiddie fare that is being served as action these days i know the real thing when i see it  we used to see it all the time back in the day  and i hardly ever see it anymore which brings me to this movie kingsman the secret service was being shown just around the corner from where i live and because i loved two of director matthew vaughns previous films layer cake and kickass i naturally took the chance to see it i had already read some comments from previous screenings that this film was totally badass and i can now say thats actually putting it mildly this film is nothing short of batshît crazy years ago tarantino said in an interview that he had written a james bond script and that he would love to direct a bond film sadly that never happened but ever since i read that i wondered what an rrated bond might be like i dont know maybe matthew vaughn has read that interview too and saw the potential because kingsman is pretty much that an ultra violent funny crazy foulmouthed james bond film with a little bit of men in black and mission impossible thrown in you could say that this is to bond what game of thrones is to lord of the rings where the former cant and dare not go for marketing and box office reasons the latter joyfully and gloriously ventures dirty and very black humor  check bad language  check gratuitous violence  check needless to say i was thrilled but its also a fantastic action film with an amazing cast oscar winners colin firth and michael caine plus sam jackson and mark hamill and spectacular overthetop fightscenes that in some instances even rival films like the raid for their sheer visceral intensity in short if youre as fed up with lame wannabe diehards and terminators as i am go watch this film apart from the rare john wick or equalizer kingsman seems to be pretty much the only antidote to the toothless generic tripe hollywood tries to pass for action these days 9 stars for the film and the story 11 stars for the balls to pull this off the way they did average = a perfect 10 edit ps i recently stumbled upon an article on the importance of r rated movies if youre a film fan especially of films that dont cater

dont have words to explain about this movie this movie is a masterpiece based on the importance of the humanity how important our species to us? whom will you save when you get the edge of your life? is it the species or its just your family or you save yourself and leave others? do you follow your heart or your mind? these are the questions we face when we watch this movie cast is excellent christopher explained about a theory theory which says that we are not alone there are beings out there who are superior to us or its just usthey who will evolve in the future one thing is for sure the person whos going to watch this movie should have some imagination skills and a good grip on physics i got a lot to tell but i dont want to spoil the surprise go watch it dont miss it one in a decade movieim a fan of david finchers work fight club seven the social network the remake of the girl with the dragon tattoo„i just dig the guys work and the films hes behind yes even alien 3 so gone girl was going to be one i was going to jump at to see and when i factored in the story and the cast to the partnership of fincher behind the camera and trent reznor and atticus ross once again helping with the  i was almost assured to love the film and then it had to go and be something even better as a story gone girl is griping and shocking it hooked me in and didnt let go for the entire ride it even stuck with me well after the movie ended it was heavy dramatic and even chilling and all these elements were made even stronger by an unbelievably talented cast that delivered like crazy with their roles affleck was fantastic as nick dunne neil patrick harris looked at home in the thriller genre and tyler perry was very entertaining as the defense attorney tanner bolt however as great as they all were they all pale in comparison to the performance of rosamund pike words fail me at truly summing up how awesome she was in her role because she was capable of being sympathetic and chilling at the same time the only phrase i can think of to really showoff how incredibly pike was is oscar worthy if she doesnt win best actress for her role in this film then all that is awesome in this world will die a little gone girl is just incredible and solidly put together the story never drags or gets boring and unrolls at the perfect pace that kept me hooked and kept surprising me at every turn overall just a tremendous movie filled with tension and heavy drama hello my name is rev ron and if you feel like reading more of my rants ramblings bad jokes geek references and other

like se7en 1995 the curious case of benjamin button 2008 the social network 2010 are top notch but im a big big fan of fight club and no movie of his has been this good but i think gone girl came pretty close though both movies are just little different but the twist is mind blower gone girl focuses on the dark side of domesticity that how a family can be this disturbed ill try no to spill any spoilers but ill tell you that the spoiler is revealed at the middle but the amazing thing is that it still hooks you to watch the rest and the ending i think cant be that good ben affleck as nick dunne was amazing but omg rosamund pike as amy dunne aka gone girl was brilliant excellent and marvelous i will only say this that she has the every right to win the academy since this is an adaption to gillian flynns book which she also writes the screenplay which i think was very clever from fincher to choose gillian for this job and she excellently done it the movie is very much to the book and everything goes as i hoped if you are choosing the movie to watch first its okay but read the book also its brilliant this is a mystery thriller movie and all the fans of this genre must watch thisim a big stephen king fan and i wondered if this movie would be a good adaptation. some of kings work has been great on film but others have not translated well. no fear. as others have noted this is an amazing film that provides inspiration and reconnects the viewer with the inner core of humanity. the script is great the directing is wonderful and the performances are unbelievably good. to give you some idea of just how good this is the first time i saw it was on an airline. problem was the headset didnt work and there werent any other headsets. the movie is so good that i couldnt stop watching it--and this is a movie heavy on dialogue. if youve never seen it do yourself a favor. note: its even better with the soundim a big fan of movies that have depth and tells a great story. american movies doesnt always provide that. the shawshank redemption however is a prime example of what american story telling can be. with a slight non-linear build up strong and patient character development the movie drags you more and more into the despair of andy dufresne but always with a sense of hope. for me theres no two ways about it. this is simply the best movie ever made. 10/10.  remember this: tolkien created lotr as a mythology and it was his aim that someone would one day re-write it and pass it down to new generations part of the mythical process and that is what jackson has done - continued the mythical process the trilogy on the whole is awesome  a must seeill start off by saying that i have loved the lord of the rings my whole life. peter jackson took middle earth then and turned it into a whole new experience. the first two movies which were astounding culminated in this epic ending to a great series. from the perfectly constructed minas tirith to the final destruction of the ring peter jackson made middle earth come alive. while there were major deviations from the book such as the army of the dead fighting at minas tirith instead of pelagir these are for the most part necessary and in the interest of time: any longer would be unbearable. a die hard book fan like me ive read them six times may be slightly upset with the exclusion of certain events the movie is still astounding and will be among my most re-watched.ill keep this short and sweet. i am not the type of person who reads critique reviews and determines whether that will make me watch a movie or not. however i didnt think i would ever want to see this movie after seeing the preview and a friend said it was a bit slow. i have to honestly say that i was impressed by the directing acting and overall story. this is a great move you should defiantly take the time out of your life to see a great movie that is not a superhero remake. this story has structure purpose and meaning. though if you cant sit still then dont bother. however i do think its time we get some culture back in our lives.ill be honest folks. this film simply blew me over. yes it has some niggling faults but it remains highly recommended. ledger is mesmerizing as the joker. a weaker actor would have hurt the film as the plot isnt airtight but you simply cant tear your eyes away from him while hes on screen. bale takes some getting used to as batman is completely in the jokers shadow in this film. its a competent performance from him. everyone else does a reasonable job and there are no weak links in the cast. i thought eckhart did very well with a difficult role. the last hour is slower than the preceding two but the film manages to hold your attention completely. unlike the uplifting end of batman begins this film ends on a downer. impressive 10/10ill always remember watching this film when i was younger it was one of the first films that ever gave me that mind-blowing experience you sometimes get when youve seen a brilliant movie. tim robbins gives what is undoubtedly for me his best performance as andy who is such an inspiring character that you find yourself truly rooting for even in the early stages of the film. morgan freeman gave a stellar performance arguably his best also as red andys cell mate another character you grow to love during this wonderful piece of cinema. this is a film i will never tire of if you havent watched it for whatever reason you should do a solid 10/10 for me enjoy.  pulp is a throwback to those crime cereals that were so prolific in newspapers and comic books of the 70s as well as a throwback to the classic mobster movies many of us grew up with. some people see this as a weakness to quentin tarantinos direction saying that hes limited to only making homages to other things in popular culture. i dont think thats true personally but in my opinion its one of his strengths. he takes a genera that is well known and popular and gives it a very fresh twist. he did that with pulp and he continues to do it today with films like kill bill and inglourious basterds. boiling pulp fiction itself down however the true lovers of cinema the people who will know exactly what tarantino is referencing or paying homage to are the ones who will get the most out of this film. that is however not to say that casual viewers wont like the film. it has a little something for everybody and is without a doubt one of the best films of the recent generation. i hope you like this review and take it into consideration if you decide to see the film. ill admit when i first heard that marvel was doing a guardians of the galaxy movie the only thing i could think was really? in a rather disappointed tone as if marvel had lost their mind after iron man iron man 2 thor captain america the avengers yes iron man 3 thor the dark world and captain america winter soldier they green lighted a gotg movie? what were they thinking? then i saw the first trailer and it caught my interest but i still just couldnt picture it not along side the greatness of the previous marvel movies it just didnt seem like it would be a good movie to me i couldnt conceive of what possible plot they could have come up with for a move with a raccoon and a tree then i saw the fourth trailer on itunes and got rather excited from the fourth trailer i started to have hope but the big problem with having hope in a movie you know nothing about is that you can get that hope dashedquickly but i bought my ticket anyway giving marvel the benefit of the doubt after all perfect track record so far if anything it wasnt going to completely suck that much i knew first part of the movie before the marvel logo actually tugged at my heart then the part after the credits had me laughing so hard i instantly knew this was going to be a perfect movie and not a single moment of the movie disappointed me i laughed and i laughed and i was excited and i grew more excited and i laughed some more it was the best time ive had at the movies in years it has been forever since i left a theater that excited to see a movie again and i plan to see it many more times thank you marvel for giving me a new favorite movieill admit that this jolly vanilla stuff isnt my cup of tea and everyone practically has read the script already but holy fairy godmother cinderella is fantastic acting and visual are stellar they reach the magical effect intended and also a touch of humility it literally dazzles with sheer production value until you cant help but feeling that warm fuzzy sensation of disney magic cinderella lily james is a poor orphan who is enslaved by her evil stepmother cate blanchett we all know this already the movie has a task to just retell the story consistently thankfully the great line of actors does that admirably well there will be a certain expectation on how the characters behave for the main pair lily james and her prince richard madden look fitting she has innocent ambiance albeit slightly passive on her trial its a less empowering female especially after frozen and maleficent ronda rousey wouldnt have this problem however it stays true to its root and if you want someone to look likable and good in blue dress lily james fits the bill richard madden delivers a light persona as its his duty to be charming he does it so well i didnt realize hes the same guy from a more harrowing ball of game of thrones the best has to be cate blanchett as the stepmother shes cunningly annoying shes a mix between complaining soccer mom and supervillain basically the most pg portrayal of antagonist to invoke loathing from audience but not till the point of giving them nightmare helena botham carter as fairy godmother is a rather predictable cast i didnt follow the movies hype but when the character appeared i thought that helena carter would be appropriate then there she was magic script is fancy and suave but its also not over reaching the dialogues are engaging as they are delivered with confident they sound very poise and high class without being too cheesy production value and costume are downright mythical it seems that cinderella wants gold statues for the wedding and seeing how majestic everyone and everything look it may just grasp the rewards for next year cinderellas biggest magic is its universal charm a children fairy tale that is uplifting and enjoyable for all ages thats what matters mostill admit id held off on seeing the shawshank redemption. i remained a little apprehensiveif you want a new story youll be disappointed if however you want the classic story retold in a beautiful simple way this will easily satisfy you we all know the story right? why mess with it? there are a few small additions mainly at the beginning to set the story we know and love but the majority of it is a reproduction of everything we cherish in my opinion thats a good thing my whole family thought maleficent was magnificent in the way it turned a story we knew on its side cinderella on the other hand we all loved because it embraced the classic plot without twisting it into something it is not visually the movie was incredible both my girls my wife and daughter thought everything looked exactly as they dreamed it should that is an enormous compliment probably their biggest complaint was that the trailers showed too many of the visual elements they wanted to be surprised with the unveiling of cinderellas dresses and the like other than that there was hardly any complaints go ahead and see the cinderella you know its wonderfulif you want a movie which you can watch many time this movie defiantly for you. watched this movie plenty of time and never get bored. watched this movie in 2008 first time and get felt on it. my friend not like to watch hollywood movies but my choice are different from them. often like watching movie. movie have nice story + every character has their own important. should also watch 300 movie im not big big fan of science fiction movies so not much like. friend this was my if you want to watch this movie you will never be disappoint so you should defiantly go for watch this movie this is my personal though.if you liked this movie see true romance written by quentin but directed by tony scott what can you say about pulp fiction one of the finest films and most influencial a masterpiece in time study and dialogue such real characters that it makes my head spin i hope he does another writing credit soon cause no one else writes dialogue like quentin its one of the best ever period  we get guy ritchie and jeremy clarkson travolta and samuel l jackson play vincent and jules a couple of bantering hit men working for marsellus ving rhames who is highly protective of his wife mia uma thurman and about to conclude a payday from a fixed boxing match  marselluss fighter butch bruce willis is haunted by a childhood encounter with his late fathers best friend a jaw-dropping cameo from christopher walken everyones destiny plays out with that of a couple of freaky stick-up artists played by amanda plummer and tim roth in 1994 all the talk was of former video-store clerk tarantinos indifference to traditional culture that patronised his sophisticated cinephilia and in fact 20 years on the writerly influences of edward bunker elmore leonard and jim thompson seem very prominent don delillo began the 90s by warning that the us is the only country in the world with funny violence maybe pulp fiction was the kind of thing he had in mind unmissableif you like previous fincher works like the game then you will thoroughly enjoy this as it is full of stylish twists and turns in the film making as someone thats not a huge affleck fan i felt he really did a good job with this role but rosamund pike steals the show with her performance the soundtrack is really well done sounding like a mix between vangelis and nine inch nails at points i believe films should be advertised purely by who directs it as a david fincher fan this film is truly damn near perfect from the subtle perversion within editing the innovative soundtrack and especially great social commentary i honestly feel this film will receive negative reviews purely for the issues it looks essentially the opposite effect of a movie like the butlerif you havent seen this yet - get off of the moon and get to the cinema this has to be one of the best films of all time. minas tirith. nuff said 10/10  everybody did an excellent job with their individual flair of black comedy. the style was very familiar if you have seen quentins earlier work. i found this movie to be completely awesome something missing from movies nowadays. movies nowadays include a message but do not execute it the right way. pulp fiction though has no message and executes it nicely. its fun its gritty and its just over-the-top greatness. this is what i wanna expect from movies but sadly nothing can have that feeling you get when you finish pulp fiction. these facts combine to the fact that pulp fiction is one of my favorite films. it has no point  but the fact that is has no point puts it up there with the greatest. i had no expectations beforehand but afterword i had so much to praise. the entertainment the humor and the point. lying before yes it has a point. but it is too obscured to find out the real meaning. i love this movie and im sure you will too. dont walk in with expectations  itll ruin the surprise. the surprise is the joy and fun youll get with the film. pulp fiction includes great acting great fun and overall great entertainment. this is by far quentins best film... 10/10.  if you havent seen it you might say why does a batman movie have such a high rating let me stop you right there this is not a batman movie. this is a disturbing dark horror-like reinterpretation of batman. you could completely care less about the dark knight character and even forget about him sometimes when heath ledger comes on the screen as the joker. a crazy man who paints his face and carves smiles on his victims with a razor sharp knife. never have i ever been more impressed by any acting performance than this. heath ledger is the scariest creepiest craziest murderous villain in all cinematic history. no offense christian bale but heath ledgerjoker is the reason this is one of the greatest movies of all time. the joker is the reason you see a 9.0 in front of you. he is scary as f***. twisting a childrens comic into a horror movie. i was never into comics superheros especially not batman. this movie blew my mind. you are seriously wasting your time on this planet not watching it. just like you are if youve never seen its always sunny in philadelphia. its like trying apple pie you have to. personally not a big fan of apple pie just used that because its a saying so replace apple pie with something you think is delicious that everyone has to try. then add this movie to your list. if you think you dont want to watch it because you dont like super hero movies you are misled and sadly mistaken.if you havent seen 2014s divergent or read veronica roths trilogy the divergent series insurgent pg13 159 may be a little hard to follow but i think its worth the effort so heres what you missed within a walled city just outside the ruins of downtown chicago in a postapocalyptic world over two centuries in the future people are divided into five factions which perform the major functions of society the erudite faction is made up of the smart

and bitter rival and a young man who calls himself four theo james and is her dauntless instructor and newfound love interest the insurgent story picks up just days after the story in divergent ends tris four caleb and peter are hiding out with the amity faction led by johanna octavia spencer tris is racked with guilt over the death of her parents but she keeps trying to suppress her feelings along with her feelings for four because shes intent on getting to the erudite leader jeannine kate winslet  and killing her but first these rebels have to find the rest of their fellow dauntless

to get to jeanine jeanine continues to hunt divergents but not just because she considers them a threat jeannines minions have found a metal box decorated with the symbols of each of the factions it contains a message from their societys founders something that jeannine believes will validate her authority in the meantime tris and company also encounter candor led by jack kang daniel day kim and a group of the factionless led by a mysterious woman named evelyn a brunette naomi watts all the factions play significant roles in this film as do the major characters who survived the first film one who didnt and some interesting new characters this is the first sequel ive reviewed and spent more time talking about the original film than the one im reviewing but there are good reasons for that first of all unlike most welldone sequels its hard to appreciate the second without understanding what happened in the first the context is important and you cant talk about insurgent without knowing the basic vocabulary from divergent secondly there are so many twists turns and surprises in this second film that i cant say much about the story without revealing major plot points its not that the sequels plot is hard to follow but i really try to stay away from spoilers all this is a way of saying that this second film of the divergent series builds very well on the story of its predecessor and doesnt waste any time establishing an identity of its own as great a job as the first film did highlighting the importance of being yourself the divergent series insurgent writes that message as if with lightning the action is heightened in the second installment and so is the emotion and adding to the message of individuality are powerful messages of selflessness and forgiveness  forgiveness of others and of yourself the story is fastpaced and thrilling the climactic scene is shocking and profound at least for those of us who havent read the books and the ending is to die for a lot of the professional critics dont seem to like this movie very much but i think theyre missing something maybe im just divergent but im giving this film an aif you havent seen 2014s divergent or read

there are good reasons for that first of all unlike most welldone sequels its hard to appreciate the second without understanding what happened in the first the context is important and you cant talk about insurgent without knowing the basic vocabulary from divergent secondly there are so many twists turns and surprises in this second film that i cant say much about the story without revealing major plot points its not that the sequels plot is hard to follow but i really try to stay away from spoilers all this is a way of saying that this second film of the divergent series builds very well on the story of its predecessor and doesnt waste any time establishing an identity of its own as great a job as the first film did highlighting the importance of being yourself the divergent series insurgent writes that message as if with lightning the action is heightened in the second installment and so is the emotion and adding to the message of individuality are powerful messages of selflessness and forgiveness _ forgiveness of others and of yourself the story is fastpaced and thrilling the climactic scene is shocking and profound at least for those of us who havent read the books and the ending is to die for a lot of the professional critics dont seem to like this movie very much but i think theyre missing something maybe im just divergent but im giving this film an aif you have not seen this film yet you are really missing something in your life. it is almost like never tasting coca cola. this film is that good. the great morgan freeman not only puts in the greatest acting performance of his life but quite possibly the greatest performance of all time. the script is so excellent that every word spoken sticks in your mind and later on in the movie you remember every word before it is recollected. this film makes you angry upset romantic sick and elated. it touches all of the senses and you cannot take your eyes off the screen for one minute. the cinematography is excellent and so is the research and hard work that has gone into ensuring that all of the costumes and props are of the era.if this film isnt making you smile or at least listen attentively as if you were in on a private candid conversation then its knocking you on your butt flooring you with some gripping scene or perhaps a slightly confusing yet pleasing turn in editing schematic unless of course youre my mother and are offended by the language and/or violence and stop watching i remember walking out of the theater with my friend thinking id just seen something amazing and that id never seen anything like it before i still remember the riveting tense feeling i had when butch played by bruce willis decides to go back for his fathers gold watch at his apartment certain that gangsters like john travoltas vincent vega are looking for him the long walk to his apartment through the back alleyways and yards was incredibly tense as you got the feeling the man was walking into certain death and then the moment he thinks everything is fine he decides to toast a pop tart i thought my heart was going to burst out of my chest and later still when you think everything is fine again youre floored by another predicament the only time this sort of experience works in my opinion is when you see a good movie for the first time in a theater naturally the second time round does not produce the same kind of tension unless of course you suffer from amnesia and dont remember what happens but what im getting at is the relationship you develop with a film in a theater versus at home on video for me pulp fiction is just one example of many where the experience was vastly enhanced by the cinematic environmentif there was a rating higher than ten this is the only movie in the world that deserves it. i say this with all seriousness. i loved this movie. this movie has everything anyone could ever want. tolkien fans {i am one myself} and everyone else will not be disappointed. for the very few people left by now who havent seen this movie do so immediately :] lord of the rings is a beautiful work of literature and the movie comes near to matching its brilliance. in the short documentary entitled ringers lord of the fans someone says that the power of lord of the rings is almost spiritual and i agree. pete jackson definitely captured the magic of the books and you dont want to miss it.if someone tells me to describe a real entertaining movie - that would be it. real for the lack of sfx is a true bless when talking about the shawshank redemption. i become fed up with pictures that achieve success based on the splendid job of the sfx crew or the team responsible for the cgi effects. films purity emphasises the importance of the act. the actors are incredibleif ever a great movie has been made it must be pulp fiction i mean you cant even say that this the film  its just film this is what movies are all about: great dialogues characters you can relate to although they are probably just as distant to your reality as eg the monsters in bad taste and appropriate music its not a movie you can just turn on and watch unfocused though if you really want to enjoy it youll probably have to see it three times or more if youre not planning on doing this dont watch it then of course theres the mystery behind pulp fiction whats in the briefcase although plausible theories have been developed well probably never know for sure quoting the man himself tarantino on the question whats in the briefcase: anything you want to be brief: i really think this is the best movie ever made if boyhood came to our theater in topeka i mustve missed it ive been on a quest to see this years nominated films so janet & i finally rented boyhood on amazon prime instant video great historic effort movie i can see why hollywood insiders have nominated it for a best picture oscar i give it all 10 stars  not so much for its story there isnt much of a main point running through all 12 years but for its neverbeendonebefore achievement rent it if you get a chance  but be aware that it is rated r for a lot of profanity that said i do think that the harry potter films did something similar by casting the same 3 lead actors and some others during 8 movies over a 10 year periodif anything pulp fiction is great because like atom egoyan tarantino doesnt see the world as linear watching this movie i really got the idea that other events do occur even if were not involved with them this movie really has a pulse where as most movies just plod along and the plot which seems utterly confusing at first makes perfect sense at the end which was the big problem with the usual suspects where the more i knew the less i cared the film is not as violent as it first seems that has been a major issue in the movie but if you count the body count is only seven or eight and a few of those deaths are implied such as the gimp a real treasure a movie that makes you appreciate what movie experiences are really aboutid never heard of the shawshank redemption when i tuned in to it about 15 minutes in on one of my satellite channels sometime around 1997 or so. it mesmerized me and the last 20 minutes astounded me. the twists the musical  the final scene. amazing. i recall doing some searches in those pre-google days probably with alta vista to find out if anyone else had ever heard of this film. i found out that they had. it turns out a whole lot of people discovered this film as a sleeper on dvd or cable or satellite. my favorite movies of around that time seen in theaters had been pulp fiction and heat. i didnt see forrest gump until around 2000 or so and didnt care for it much. a good year for films. given the comments in the past half year or so that ive gone back through i suppose shawshank will fall below some other films. there seems to be a a trend toward making hey its not all that that is its not all that good its lousy its overrated etc. whatever its a great film. and when i happened to see it late one night on my satellite system i thought i was the first to realize how great it was. it took several years for me to spot the high ratings on imdb and to read that it had become a cult classic favorite. ditto for the big lebowski which for a while i thought i was the only fan of. now its a subject of festivals and midnight watchings sort of like rocky horror once was. i saw rocky horror in 1976 at the world science fiction convention in kansas city and thought it was not very entertaining. for me the last 20-30 minutes is just the best. one twist after another all seamlessly done. and a compelling musical . unforgettable.id heard about this film a few years ago and id heard it was good. i was lied to. this film wasnt good it was outstanding i cant believe i never watched this sooner from the opening scenes where the mysterious andy dufresne is being dragged into hell to the credits as red runs across the beach to him this film was in a word perfect no holes to spot almost everything was completely accurate probably some of the best script ive ever heard and a brilliant story. normally if a film goes over two hours i start to get a little bored and i end up wanting the film to end but this was completely the opposite i never wanted this to end and the hefty 140 minutes get you wanting more and the story drew me in so much i felt as if i was there. normally with films adapted from stephen king books they dont do so well on the big screen but this has proved that wrong overall i like this film because its realistic it goes into great depth and the story is so gripping you cant take your eyes off the screen and this film will always be there at the top as one of my favourite films everid give this movie an 11 if it were possible. the lord of the rings: the return of the king lives up to its extremely long title. its a long movie. once youve seen the extended edition theres no going back. many key scenes were cut from the film. even today the special effect hold up better than many halfassed films on the market. epic is the one word to define this franchise. for long i have debated whether the second or the third film is the best. i cant decide. the music is beyond words. howard shore has crafted one of the best original s ever up there next to star wars. the lord of the rings shows hollywood how battle scenes are done. if youve never seen this die in a hole. long live the king.i would like to start out by addressing something i find totally unfathomable the sheer volume of criticism the film has attracted here on imdb though i cannot say i am completely unsurprised by it after all this site in particular seems to bring out the worst side of people and attracts many of the negative nancys of the internet still its rather disheartening that so many people are being so dismissive of this film over trivial or even objectively incorrect perceptions of its weaknesses gone girl directed by modern cinematic mastermind david fincher is one of the most stirring mindbending and thrilling mysterydramas in years elevated thanks to finchers expert guidance and universally incredible performances from its expansive cast the film is very much the perfect modern thriller delivering enough edgeofyour seat twists to keep you enthralled and still pondering the implications of the film long after its finished ben affleck stars as nick dunne a man whose seemingly perfect marriage has been crumbling for some time culminating in the disappearance of his wife amy rosamund pike the morning of their fifth anniversary nick soon finds himself at the center of an enormous cluster of problems including the growing media circus surrounding the case uneasiness with local authorities who are trying to find amy and his own inconsistent attitude which is painting him in an increasingly suspicious light what happened to amy? is nick truly the loving husband he wants to work to believe he is or is he the sinister sociopath that media wants to paint him as? and most importantly did nick in fact kill his wife? while i cannot give too much away as to avoid spoilers i must say the casting and performances are incredible and absolutely spoton affleck knocks it out of the park as a troubled man who may not be the figure he outwardly tries to portray himself as neil patrick harris and tyler perry make for thrilling supporting roles that take you by surprise especially considering their predominately comedic backgrounds kim dickens gives a great turn as a local officer who is simultaneously one of nicks biggest assets and also one of his biggest detractors and carrie coon shines as nicks sister who serves as his moral support despite not always telling him everything he wants to hear but it is rosamund pike the titular gone girl who shines the brightest this is her film everything about her role is intriguing troubling and keeps the mystery and suspense alive in particular her journal entries which comprise the backbone of the film and also lead the audience to question whether she or her husband had their own ulterior motives in the marriage and warps the perception of the story pike deserves so much more recognition for this role because this is the role of a lifetime writing duties are handled by gillian flynn whom also wrote the novel upon which the film is based while i have not read the book and therefore refuse to compare it flynn constructs a tight concise yet also deliciously mysterious tale and some of her framing devices and artistic flourishes help elevate what could have otherwise been quite the routine film im excited to see what comes next for flynn because this film has definitely made me want to keep my eye on her work in the future director david fincher continues to prove his status as one of the great directors working today with this film as he has with previous works he soaks this film in his deliciously dark twisted sometime nihilistic visual and storytelling sensibilities and it fantastically compliments and augments the uneasiness of the story and the unsure relationship the audience has with the characters and finally there is the remarkable  by trent reznor and atticus ross my god this is one of the most unique and fascinating musical s ive heard in some time ive been increasingly interested in the duos work especially after their last collaboration with fincher on the girl with the dragon tattoo remake which i will admit i think has a slightly superior  and they once again provide the perfect audible backdrop to the visual experience of the film bravo reznor and ross gone girl is easily one of the best films of the year in my opinion its a stellar example of modern mystery and tightly assemble character drama and its a film that will haunt you long after it ends its a perfect 10i work in a video store and there is something i experience every day. although there are more and more superhero-movies out there and even more are coming up soon many people still disregard them. and one cannot really judge them for that because after all these movies are still quite special in a way. one does not only have to like action-movies but apart from that one has to suspend ones disbelieve as to accept the supernatural or superhuman maybe even more than in science-fiction. however regardless of whether you like superhero-movies or not or whether you like action-movies or not in my opinion there is no way around christopher nolans batman begins and his other movies for that matter and the movie this review is about: the dark knight. in it the masked vigilante batman continues his struggle against crime in the fictional metropolis gotham with the help of police commissioner gordon and the new district attorney harvey dent. some time has passed since the events of batman begins and the struggle is going quite well. until they have to face the mysterious and sadistic criminal mastermind called the joker and the chaos he unleashes. the cinematography is great solemn and sublime wide shots are mixed with intensive close shots and stunning action-scenes. the colors and the light are hard and realistic and get darker and darker as the movie proceeds. as for the cast christian bale gives the best performance as batman/bruce wayne there has been so far he is disillusioned and vulnerable and still not willing to give up. he is a mere human who has to play the role of the playboy and billionaire on the one side and a masked vigilante a symbol for hope and justice on the other. gary oldman underplays his part as jim gordon in a down-to-earth simple way. maggie gyllenhaal is both tough and vulnerable as rachel dawes lawyer and bruce waynes love michael caine plays a supporting father-figure as bruce waynes butler alfred aaron eckhart is both shining and charismatic as harvey dent and twisted and wrecked as two-face- the list could be continued throughout the whole cast. to them: take a bow you have been part of this great filmi wont put any spoilers in this review  but i think everyone with a brain has already seen this or at least should want to see this movie because it is one of the greats of all time. i do think that christian bale did do an excellent job playing my favorite super hero  batman but this obviously isnt the reason this movie is on imdbs top 100 . heath ledger has one of the most spectacular acting performances ive seen in my life  i am 16 plus the plot line is amazing and well written. i typed this review mostly because i was bored but also to express my love for this movie. i have the movie at home but if it comes on tv i dont even think about passing it by. this is a movie for the history booksi wont possibly say anything new about this movie as its very professional certainly best movie of the year etc. but i want something to add - its sure one of the best movies ever made because of love of all team to tokeins book and material. its something you cant describe it because effects for example - yeah theyre great but you have seen them before. but how they are done how is acting is done soundtrack music everything - it shows that many for them - for actors artists for all team - it was magnum opus. work of life. made with love. best movie ever made in fantasy genre - and best movie of the year. oh and certainly the best triology ever made period.i will say that being a big fan of the animated fan i will say that the film did a rather decent job being faithful of the material but adding a few twists and spins of its own in this version it expands more upon cinderellas family family and having a chance encounter with the prince when cinderellas mother and father pass away she is left under the cruelty of lady tremaine played wonderfully by cate blanchett who makes the character rather cruel but somewhat sympathetic who wants to keep the money to her and her sleazy but dimwitted daughters anatasia and druzilla another surprise is helena bonaham carter who looks stunning as the fairy godmother lily james version of cinderella retains the kindness and strong will but manages to have a bit more backbone and courage richard madden does a decent job making the prince likable who loves cinderella for who she is overall i would say overall a great film for those of all agesi will never forget this trilogyÓ jacksons directing achievement cant be measureÓ special effects cinematography make up costume design sound  editing screenplay actors performances ... everything in its right place. im sure lots of people all over the world feels the same about the movie. ian mckellen is gandalf he is not just an actor... he really became the white wizardÓ mortensen wood weaving bloom astin blanchette tyler ... what a crewÓ i read the book four years ago and i just couldt believe that images from movie matched perfectly with my imagination. i wish this movie make directors and producer of hollywood assume new challengesÓ god save the kingÓi will never forget the first time i watched the shawshank redemption with my father. both of us were fans of prison and male-bonding movies and choose the film only expecting to watch a solid drama. needless to say that when the last line was delivered and the tv screen painted the walls with a beautiful blue the feeling that we had just watched something exceptional instantly cut through our hearts and before the second viewing we would regularly mention how great that film with the poster was. then i would never miss it whenever i found it on tv and after each viewing it unveiled one unsuspected element of its unique appeal. i guess if it doesnt justify at least it explains why this movie that didnt do well in the theaters had a better success on vhs tv and dvd before it would ultimately dethrone the godfather from the first place on imdb top 250. and its only justice if the shawshank redemption the least spectacular of the four best picture nominees in the glorious 1994 made by a relatively unknown director a movie with an appeasing and appealing patience took its time to grow on people and did it pretty well as if it applied its own philosophy patiently but determinedly. this is the strength of the shawshank redemption its ability to tell a story that spans a long period of time without trying to get to the so-called essential the simplest things take their full meanings the smallest details have their share of importance. and think about it in a prison where everyone wears the same outfits where the days are regulated by the same routine all you can do is to make a life out of this routine make a place to get closer to your own definition of having a life. and as we penetrate the impressive walls of shawshank from the first vertiginous panoramic shot were literally submerged by the solemn austerity of the location conveying a very hostile feel. these characteristics are perfectly incarnated by the figure of the warden samuel norton whos like the male alter-ego of nurse ratched from one flew over the cuckoos nest. and the comparison with formans film isnt fortuitous as shawshank intends to domesticate its occupants to the same limits of mechanical alienation to the point that the only thing left to the inmates is to control their only valuable treasure: time by getting busy finding their own reason-to-be like the veteran brooks james whitmore was the man with the books red remarkably played by morgan freeman was the man who could get you things. in a very intelligent move from the script the hero of the film the laconic andy dufresne an upper-class banker played in all nuance by tim robbins is condemned to a life sentence at shawshank for the murder of his wife and her lover. and nothing indicates if he is innocent or guilty and i wondered if any certitude would have conditioned my appreciation of the character. i think it was necessary for us to have a reasonable doubt about his innocence in order to let his character progressively grow on us until we believe by ourselves that he was indeed the victim of unfortunate circumstances the same feeling that grew in the heart of red before becoming his best friend. morgan freeman is the pillar of the film while tim robbins is its free spirit both allow us in a remarkable complementarity to dream of abstract notions like hope and freedom while being practical and busy in the same time. and again their friendship is a slow process that takes its time to progress and reaches a pivotal point when andy was allowed to put his bankers casket again and feels that prison didnt deprive him from his social quality. shawshank is not slow but more a patience-demanding film with a sense of decency in the way it trusts our intelligence. and the films motto on which relies its philosophical core is get busy living or get busy dying. now two things occur to me while writing these lines a heart-breaking sequence about the inmate brooks who was freed after 50 years of detention and who realized he was institutionalized. a notion explained by red: when the infamous wall that scared you so much becomes your personal guiding light while outside its all dark and your time is deconstructed. brooks couldnt live outside shawshank so there was no other way he could live. the second thing is the sad passing of steve jobs today. and as i was reading his famous stanford speech i couldnt help but make a connection with the beautiful message of darabonts film an invitation to dream to escape from any sort of walls or obstacles put in your life and heart with as many dreams as you can fulfill a notion illustrated by the beautiful scene when andy put some classical music on the microphone so the prisoners could for once elevate themselves and having an ephemeral moment of pure freedom this is the triumph of human spirit this understanding of the value of life is the shawshank redemption in the same vein than one flew over the cuckoos nest shawshank is a constant encouragement to fight the system and use time for the best for whatever constitutes our dreams being men again able to enjoy to feel to give a meaning to our lives. in other words hope hope that things can get better despite the adversity. to quote steve jobs : courage is the discovery that you may not win and trying when you know you can lose. this is the true intelligence of life what makes it worth living. the shawshank redemption a powerful adaptation of stephen kings novel is one of the greatest american films: a powerful story of courage perseverance hope and ultimately friendship and humanity.i will keep this short pulp fiction has amazing characters played by fantastic actors like john travolta uma thurman bruce willis christopher walken and of course the most badass man on the planet samuel l jackson this is a movie i compare to snatch and lock stock and two smoking barrels those movies are great but nothing compared to pulp fiction it has a great and entertaining story and is a true classic it is quentin tarantinos best movie and that says a lot it has great action scenes and funny lines some quotes from this movie will i remember for the rest of my life if i summarize it i can say that it is a funny good written good action scenes good quotes and fantastic actors i recommend this highly it is way better than the godfather and the shawshank redemption it deserves to be on top it also deserved to win an oscar although forrest gump was good this is betteri went to watch this film not knowing much about the background of the story or what it was exactly about it started off well although in my opinion it did drag on for a long period of time before they actually ended up in space this does not effect the film though or my rating one bit as it all worked out in the end and the build up was necessary the special effects in this film are awesome and are used in a way which i was literally at the edge of my seat in shear anticipation suspense and a slight sense of nervousness its very tense in many parts and it certainly keeps you thinking i dont know how people in the right state of mind can give this film a 1 star or say disappointing rubbish stick to batman nolan these people dont know what they are talking about and are just trying to be picky and find a way to make the film look bad its a brilliant film something suitable for all the family definitely a film for everyone one of the best movies everi went to the cinema last night...and wow ive got to read the books again some day third time. cant wait for the directors cut version :- if you havent seen it yet...then what are you doingi went into this movie with a high standard because of all of the movies nominations and awards that critics have approved as a deserving addition to this movies accomplishments i also had skeptics on the plot as it was considered to be basic and that nothing really happens but where it hit me most was at the end where i could look back on these chapters of this kids life that made it interesting and worth wild to have all these experiences that a normal kid should have of course since the title of the movie is boyhood it focuses mainly on the boys early life but i feel that a diverse audience can find something relatable stir up some emotions as supporting characters effect and intertwine with the boy the dialog also adds to the realistic downtoearth atmosphere that the audience can immerse in and feel comfortable in though this movie neither focuses on really though times in the boys life or even the greatest of his childhood it shows how important the present moment is and to be able to look back on a memory and enjoy the life you have overall this movie was something i thought about for a while if a movie can do that and sort of change me personally i believe this to be worthy of its acclaimed recognitioni went into this film with high hopes i was not disappointed the cast was spot on coming from an old reader of the comic series they introduced the kree to the marvel comics universe finally and every single one of the actors cast as the guardians was spot on i am a casual fan of professional wrestling and i am not a fan of dave bautista i understand that most professional wrestlers are excellent actors but didnt expect much of bautista as drax the destroyer instead bautista acted out his role to perfection as did every one else in the film i honestly wasnt expecting much from rocket raccoon considering hes entirely cgi or groot instead rocket was voiced to perfection and amusing and groot stole the show there was a great mixture of emotion action and campy humor to make this film an icon in the marvel cinematic repertoire the cheesy 70s and 80s soundtrack made the film so much better for which i commend director james gunni watched this yet again at the weekend and it remains my favourite film one that somehow continues to get better with every viewing tarantinos witty and lurid script is delivered spot-on by actors that seem to have been born to play their parts most impressive being samuel l jacksons bible-quoting hitman and bruce willis honourable boxer willis usually ups the ante when hes in good company and in this film the company doesnt get much better each character has their own classic scene even the cameos christopher walkens in particular and each scene seems better than the last even when you know whats coming youre looking forward to it with relish add a superb soundtrack that compliments the films retro feel and theres not much negative to say even the beefy running time doesnt detract from the fun its not a movie youll be wanting to watch with your mother as the tongue-in-cheek comedy is as black as it could possibly be but its brash enthusiastic film-making that cant be ignored or - up to now at least - betteredi watched this movie for the umpteenth time probably last sunday and how much i loved it yet again a movie i would never ever get bored of and definitely one of my all time favorites. a simple yet wonderful story about hope hope _„_ one word that drives all of us and gives us reason to live. we push ourselves through our mundane lives in the hope of achieving / finding something that we dream of. in the words of this movies protagonist _„_ hope is a good thing maybe the best of things and no good thing ever dies superlative performances by tim robbins and morgan freeman. a must watch if you havent  smÍ©agol is continuing with his plan to lure frodo and sam to their doom in shelobs lair and gandalf aragorn legolas and gimli are reunited with merry and pippin at isengard. when pippin looks into the palantÍ_r a sort of dark crystal ball he sees the city of minas tirith under attack unfortunately he himself is seen by sauron. galdalf takes him to minas tirith when he rides there to warn of the impending attack while the others remain behind to raise an army large enough to assist in that coming battle. i thought that the battle of helms deep was impressive but it seems a mere skirmish compared to the battle of minas tirith here there are thousands of orcs supported by mercenaries mounted on gigantic elephant like creatures that are large enough to crush a man and his horse under their giant feet. all the time this battle rages frodo and sam are journeying deeper and deeper into the land of mordor to mount doom in order to end saurons reign once and for all. this is probably the best film of the trilogy i can see why it raked in the awards the only weakness was the epilogue once the quest was completed the film could have ended at the crowning of the king rather than going on to their return to the shire... even though im aware that this was in the book. peter jackson did a fantastic job bringing such an epic story to the screen he was of course assisted by a fantastic cast who really brought the characters to life. i wasnt expecting the twist on the sleeping beauty story the villain is actually the likable character in this plot i actually found that really interesting the witch wasnt the bad guy this time we at least got to understand the reason for her actions i almost never thought of the possibility that the witchs action was as a result of hurt the classic tales always makes it look like the witch placed the curse just because of the fact that she was evil well that was a nice plot twist i found the dramatic performance and the dialogue very theatrical almost like a stage play which made it really exciting the way the camera focused on jolies face was actually really cool i liked the effects in the movie not too much but just enough to make it excitingi was still in high-school and first lotr:fotr came out. i watched posters all over the place on the bus stop in subways and everywhere. i went to watch a movie and saw the trailer. it has very ancient type look and has no interesting feelings. the only part that looked very surprising was the end of the trailers with humongous army. then one day i was surfing the web and hit the download link on kazza if people may know what kazza was at that time. after few hour the download was complete. so i sat on the chair in front of the 15 inch computer screen with video size of iphone screen 600*400. after more than three hours my mind was lost in that small screen. i could not believe what i saw. i was a spectacle of life. a sheer journey to the land of fantasy warriors and elves  i kind of fell in love with arwen at that time. then i realized that some how the end was not complete. it stuck in my mind for few days then started surfing the web again. eventually i found out that it was the first part of the trilogy. and after 10 years its is still the best movie ever made. the movie rewrote the scale ad scope of making movies. i hope the hobbit turns out to be of similar calibre.i was reluctant to see this movie - thought it was just another prison movie - and i was certainly tired of mindless violence. i was channel surfing one evening - and stumbled across this movie. i watched a few minutes thinking i would change channels at the first commercial. almost 2 hours later - after seeing the end - i sat there...saying wow. that was a great movie. i have since recommended it to friends and family...it has grown in popularity due to word of mouth - and certainly deserves its spot at the top. morgan freeman put on a masterful performance as did tim robbins. the way their friendship develops and the interplay with the other inmates - a wonderful story. if you have not watched this movie yet - put preconceived notions aside sit down and enjoy the journeyi was reading some of these posts and decided to put in my two cents worth on the pulp debate. someone stated that they had just seen the movie in 1999 five years after its release and could not understand the hype. well therein lies the greatest problem facing a film like pulp fiction: everything novel and unique it brought to the cinema five years ago has been utterly ransacked by the hollywood mainstream. anyone who saw a film like bonnie & clyde 30 years ago will say what an impact the film made on them when today it seems only like a well constructed gangster film. pulp fiction already seems a little dated because we keep seeing these characters and situations appearing on film. sure some of what tarantino did had been done before. wed seen rampant drug use in drugstore cowboy and gangster black comedy in goodfellas but tarantino successfully mixed the dark subject matter with hipness for the nineties and thusly created the film and the film revolution that true film lovers had been waiting years for. pulp fiction trampled the hollywood blockbuster industry remember this was the year of forrest gump and sent studios running to sundance to find the next big thing. people who look at pulp fiction years after its release are going to have the same reaction one would have after listening to say nirvanas nevermind: its good but i dont get the fuss. of course you dont. you have to be there from the beginning to realize just how much of an impact these artists had on everything we see and hear today. people who call pulp fiction the greatest film of all time are probably in need of an introduction to a few more films. pulp fiction is not the greatest film ever made. it is however the most important film of our generation.i was overwhelmed by this film. i felt like an evil little wormtongue when i saw the amazing battles and the amazing every thing. i cried like a little baby throughout the entire film. the energy is splendid for this film. this movie does it for me. i have to say that the lord of the rings trilogy to me is what the star wars trilogy is to my parents. i am proud to say look at this amazing epic in my generation. this is a giant step in the right direction for epic movie making. on a scale of 1-10 i give it a 15. mad crazy and awesome. great job crew and cast of lord of the rings.i was literally hooked. no wonder this film is rated amongst the best ever. this is definitely one of the best movies you will see your entire life. morgan freemans narration was awesome. tim robbins powerfully illustrates the importance of hope. all the characters did a superb job. this is surely one of my all time favourite movies. its a classic & a true masterpiece of cinema... dont think just watch & savour it. i saw the following comment by someone and thought of adding it to mine i agree 100% to everything of the following: many people in this world are unhappy. most people in this world dont want to be unhappy. lots of people wish pray and above all hope for that magic wand to wave and wash them of their fears losses angers and pains once and for all. they see lots of other people seemingly in this magical state while they suffer. to borrow the words of another film theyre watching the bluebirds flying over the rainbow. many unhappy people have learned that the magic wand doesnt exist. theyre not destined to join the bluebirds and fairy tales dont come true. its not that no one lives happily ever after its just that theyre not going to. theyre busy dying. in this film or as some people have quite correctly said this fairytale magic wands exist. and that magic wand is andy dufrense imitating houdini. however this film is not about him. neither is it about the prison the governor the guard the plot the acting the cinematography the script the direction or the . its about red. he is the one who has become institutionally unhappy hes not only trapped in a prison not only has he given up on the idea of ever leaving not only does he have no hope he knows that if the miracle would ever happen to him he couldnt cope. hes safe in his unhappiness and that security is what keeps him going. hope is as red say dangerous. the metaphor for a certain illness here is very clear to me and i know that a rather large number of people suffer from it. a large proportion of those dont understand whats wrong but they certainly can recognise a fellow sufferer. those who are mercifully untouched by this illness definitely dont understand whats going on in those who do. theyre too busy living. just a little piece of advice to everyone who hated/disliked this film  . a thousand kisses and million thanks for you. a very must see a greatest cinemas history event... i was incredibly happy with the way peter jackson did the last installment of lord of the rings. he kept all the major plot occurences from the book and transformed them into a visual presentation of the book the ending was so parallel to the boo kthat it had near the same affect of instilling emotion into me as the book did. therefore i think that rotk is one of the best movies this year and in the history of filmmaking.i was blown away when i first saw the dark knight. it is better then batman begins and is one of my most favorite movies. i am glad heath ledger was nominated but the dark knight should have been nominated for best picture. heath ledger was very capable at playing the joker. i like the scene where he killed the gangster with a pencil. aaron eckhart was great at playing two-face and did better then tommy lee jones did in batman forever. he was evil but i felt bad for him. i liked the hospital confrontation between the joker where he used his coin and spared jokers life. theres only one bad part of dark knight. i liked the final battle between batman and the joker but after he was captured for good they did not show him in arkham asylum. i think maggie gyllenhall did better than katie holmes and i liked her scene with the joker. christian bale gave an oscar worthy performance and he had improved since batman begins. i also liked when lucius fox referenced catwoman. i cant wait to see the dark knight rises. i am kind of glad that bane is one of the villains. hes not that well known but he is famous for breaking the bat. if heath ledger had not died he would have been in dark knight rises. he would have teamed with bane. everyone should see the dark knight because it is an excellent film.i was at the video store with my girlfriend and we wanted to rent out a few movies. i decided that one of the films we should rent out is the shawshank redemption. i had always wondered why it had such good ratings as well as being positioned at #2 in the imdb top 250 and i thought i would see just how good the movie really was. when the film concluded in a way that i would have never conceded i sat there in front of the tv surprised and dumbfounded. when my girlfriend asked me what was wrong i simply just said that....is the greatest movie i have ever seen in my entire life. it was not just an ordinary and clichÍ©d film i was watching it was art on the screen 2 and a half hours of extraordinary cinematography unforgettable acting and a plot so compelling that you just did not want it to end. morgan freeman as red and tim robbins as andy are the perfect choices for their respective roles. the prison setting is so daunting and visually satisfying while the corruption by the warden and the guards is dreadfully brutal yet extraordinarily eye popping. i normally dislike some movies that normally go for over 2 hours as i think they are just dragging on but shawshank along with very few others kept me glued to the screen in suspense. i hung onto every scene and every word uttered in the entire film. the shawshank redemption is unique in its own little way and it has affirmed my belief that hope and courage through adversity is possible and rewarding. not many movies are made like this and i just hope that there is a movie like but probably not as good as the shawshank redemption that will be made in this hostile and cruel 21st century. movies like this really change lives. 10/10i was a little apprehensive to see this movie as i pegged it for a chick flick it was a date night with my girlfriend and usually im bored by these kinds of movies however i was pleasantly surprised at how captivating the movie was i felt the pace in the beginning was a bit slow though and these folks talking about oh i saw the trailer so i knew what was going to happen are idiotic of course youve seen the movie the cinderella story has been around for twice to three times our own lifetimes if not more in many cultures out there *******potential spoilers************ i think the the screenplay actors and actresss casting and the slight differences made this a kids movie for adults we grew up watching these movies as children in some capacity so therefor myself and my girlfriend had a bit of nostalgia while not having to watch a cartoon per say i did say in a joking manner if they dont have the singing mice ill be very disappointed although they didnt exactly have that they defiantly nailed it very tastefully throughout with her creature companions the one thing that does get me about this version is i wish they could have somehow rewritten was the fact her very loving father who only wanted the best for his daughter somehow married an evil stepmother then left her to fend for herself while he was away i know the writing cant always take off down that road as it would be hard to bring it back to the title person in the movie the evil stepmother showed up evil had evil daughters how could cinderellas father not see these people are awful? i feel as though he should have maybe had some similar ties like the prince to potentially be forced to marry the evil stepmother in an attempt to make his fortunes or business stronger in the end the strings i feel are tied up and the movie is brought back to its center stronghold of love kindness and forgivenessi walked into this movie expecting something magical from director richard linklater and he did not disappoint at no point did the aging process seem gimmicky it flowed with each year of his life being one heartfelt episode after another while i expected there to be some giant emotional scene one scene that would be sure to make everyone in the theater weep im almost glad i didnt get it while there were some sweet scenes that i wont get into i liked this fully honest tale of growing into oneself with genius writing and wondrous acting especially from the leads coltrane and arquette with the latter i expect a best supporting actress nomination this should go down as a film along the lines of many other great comingofage films that everyone young and old should experience at least once in their lifetimei used to like action movies more than anything else. i watched shawshank redemption in 2007. when i watched it for the first time i did not know that it is a great movie. when i watched it for the second time i felt that it should be one of the greatest movies. for the first time checked imdbs top 250 movies and i amazed to see shawshank redemption at number two anyway its number one at present. the performances of all the artists are excellent. not a single character is waste. especially tim robins excels as andy dufresne. narration by morgan freeman is sensational. the scenes between morgan freeman and tim robins are by far the best. the ending is one of best surprises i have seen in movies. this movie should have got the ascar. i give 10 out of 10 for this phenomenal movie.i used to leave a theatre after seeing a highly anticipated movie specifically a sequel and be so revved up about what i saw that i would declare that movie to be the best of a series. after each of the prequel star wars films i rated that one the best as good as any of the originals...for a time until my opinion balanced out and i had a more well-rounded take. for that reason i steer away from that mindset and did for dark knight. though my opinion is solidifying already after having seen a warner bros. screening last night dark knight ably stands on its own with or without batman begins. at a two and a half hour runtime its definitely an epic of a movie but one that never runs out of gas. a delightful addition to this experience was a healthy amount of imax footage which significantly adds to the feel of being on a personal and gruesome tour of gotham city. christian bale plays such a well rounded batman and bruce wayne qualities that none of those who have donned the cowl before him have pulled off. i still have to remember that bale is british since he speaks with such a spot on american accent. bale has a particular slurring lisp that serves him quite well charmingly for bruce wayne and threateningly for batman. countering him is the late heath ledger who plays such a scary and creepy joker that i found it impossible to not have chills half the time i saw him on screen. what really separates this brand of joker from jack nicholsons portrayal is true unpredictability. its obvious that to be a good guy and think like the joker it really takes a toll and it sure isnt easy. how exactly does one take him down when hes woven his harebrained plot around multiple hostages explosives or disappearing parlor tricks initially i was uneasy about how the character of harvey dent would be handled. in my mind there was really only one faithful portrayal of him and that could be found in the batman animated series of the early 90s. as well as tommy lee jones could have handled him in batman forever he certainly did not though it still was a highlight of that movie. aaron eckhart ably assumes the mantle here delivering a performance out of this world easily on par with the batman animated series. be it known this caped avenger stands for the good of gotham city that the police force and its counterparts cant represent the good that has no jurisdiction no procedures...and no rules save for one. i can only hope that weve seen just the prelude to the dark knights upcoming legendary battles with the worst of gotham citys dark underside. the dark knight gets a solid 10 of 10 stars.i totally adored the concept of hope in this film. i love how the director portrays the shawshank tyrants as corrupt murderers thats pretty much what they are and serve as the grounds for the escape of andy. now morgan freemans got talent i love that guy he may not be the greatest out there but he is a force to be reckoned with on the set. i loved how he gave the story flavor with his descriptions of characters and perceptions of how life was in lonely jail cells of shawshank. you know theres a lot more to say about this movie its too good too be true. especially the ending which by the way brought tears to eyes the most moving scene overall it was superb and all thanks to stephen king for putting this in the form of alphabets in the first place. im starting to regret not reading any of his novels. and kudos to the director for even coming up with such an idea for a movie.i took my daughter to see this film yesterday and we both absolutely loved it angelina jolie is perfect in the role she is quite stunning in real life but with the contact lenses and cheek bones added she looks incredible and acts the part of maleficent amazingly well the updated storyline of why maleficent curses aurora from the original disney film shooting it as a prequel is feasible and quite understandable when you watch this film lana del reys voice for the song title is also beautiful and haunting i cant stop playing the theme tune i shall be taking a friend to see the film again a fantastic fantasy film and stay to the credits at the end to hear the songi thought this was probably the last one ill see. i really liked this one i recommend it i just think they are never going to be the same after this one because of heath ledgers late passing. i really appreciate the acting selection. i have seen every batman up until this point excluding some of the cartoons and i believe that my kids will watch this i just think they are getting too dark these day so i actually walked out of the last one. i can kind of see me going back i had some beer before i entered into the theater so perhaps that just made me sleepy but overall i think this on the one before the one i walked out on was pretty good. nice job. thumbs up to the casting director. real big thumbs up therei thought the movie was the best one. the graphics were awesome as well and the acting too. my fav part in the movie was the fighting part near the end when aragorn got all the ghosts to help fight that was really cool.i thought batman begins was a very well conceived and put together movie. we finally get batman as a fully rendered character. we gain new insight into his motivations and the variables he must contend with in his role as protector of gotham. we get to see gary oldman as an honest-to-goodness good guy. and we get to see liam neeson conducting perhaps his strangest facial hair experiment yet. but after seeing the dark knight batman begins will forevermore be viewed by me at least as a handy little prologue to a frickin masterpiece of a superhero film. to say its the deepest mainstream comic adaptation ever produced would be akin to calling the nolan/ledger joker a bit eccentric. while watching it i found myself thinking it was very long which is usually a sign that its too long and therefore boring. but thats not actually the case here. the script is bulging with ideas philosophical musings themes which christopher nolan is not content to gloss over in favour of cool set-pieces as many comic adaptations are but wants to explore wants to allow the characters to explore at a logical pace. so what i guess im saying is considering what it sets out to do the movie is long enough while still constantly holding the viewers interest. and thats not to say the thematic exploration comes at the expense of big action either. on the contrary there is some truly awesome stuff going on here. the chase with the truck for example is fantastic and theres some great hand-to-hand stuff too. but what engages us most is the characters and while the script is brilliant the dialogue is sharp and quite funny for the first two-thirds before the drama really kicks in this mainly comes down to the cast. christian bale. taller than michael keaton was. more menacing than val kilmer was. less like adam west than george clooney was. solid and committed as always. he gives the character life and actually makes us feel for him. the word tortured keeps coming to mind...and i suppose its pretty appropriate. heath ledger. yknow id heard talk of an oscar nomination and thought it sounded a bit dubious. a batman villain winning an oscar is that what its come to then i thought is it because he didnt get one for brokeback or more dubious still...is it because he...died but...well...how can i put it... it seems a bit blasphemous to compare jack nicholson to cesar romero but after seeing heath at work...jack who once seemed so awesome just looks...well...lame. if youve seen it you hopefully get what i mean. if you havent...you need to. you will discover the true definition of commitment. maggie gyllenhaal. i didnt have any problem with katie in the first one at the time but i doubt she could have pulled off the more emotional stuff rachel goes through here. seeing recasting was necessary does tom have a problem with his wife being involved with batman too many bad memories perhaps why am i even talking about such garbage here they could have done a butt-load worse than maggie. she rocks. as does aaron eckhart. but im not giving anything away. suffice it to say my mind was blown...again. makes tommy lee jones look like...you get the idea. michael caine. still one of my favourite actors. alfred is the shiz. morgan freeman. morgan freeman. aok. gary oldman. as in bb no mania. no psychosis. no nervous tics. absolute subtlety. manages to hold his own alongside christian heath and aaron without resorting to parlour tricks. sign of spectacular talent. go gaz. eric roberts william fichtner michael jai white tiny lister the whole thing is just a big bag of thoughtful well-executed entertainment. its equal parts cerebral and visceral. ideas and action. ive liked every batman movie so far okay besides batman & robin but this one makes them all look pretty bloody ordinary.i think this movie is the best it had the best special effects ive ever seen also the best actors who played their role really well. it also had a great background music which i totally loved. this movie really deserved all the oscars they have won : all the scenes in the movie made a great representation of tolkiens stories. i definitely was captured all the landscapes in the movie new zealand rules if people havent seen it they should because its really entertaining. by now ive seen it like 20 times or so. the dialogue in the movie are really complex which made me think a little at least for me its good. everyone must at least see one of the 3 because they all are great.  he dares to go the next step in filmmaking and wins the audience over. due to the extreme amount of violence drugs language and sexuality i strongly advise the faint-hearted and children to keep way away from this movie. otherwise if you dont mind a bit of naughty fun and a huge exciting spark in your movie-life then see this now pulp fiction is definitely an experience you wont forget easily. i think this movie is great special but not for the story or the characters some people thought its a biography or an emotional movie  well this movie is not so they came disappointed talking about how this movie is boring if you want to see a sweet movie that you can enjoy and go on you will hate this movie richard linklater didt take 12 years to make movies like the fault in our stars he have something to say about the meaning of life real life not fake one and how people deal with it so this movie about the philosophy of life you see people growing up in 12 years they are normal people so you suppose to think about your childhood there are some keys in the script to catch the idea before the end mom patricia arquette looks back and discovers that her life came to end her two child left the house and now she is lonely in a small flat she cries and says i thought it would be more people who hate this movie thought that would be more in a 12 years making movie but in the real life nothing actually happens you just grow up fast and you never seize the moment at the last scene mason meets a girl in his first day of collage she told him that people say seize the moment are wrong  i am thinking its the other way around you know like the moment seizes us mason agreed with this every one who love this movie will catch this  it is the mean massage of the movie dont regret about your sh*t life because the moment it is just  it is like its always right now now you suppose to understand this movie if you say its waste of time and nothing is happen well go and watch twilight saga i bet that is your favorite type if you get the idea of this movie you keep watching it more and more and every time you will remember your life there is a waste of time to search a meaning for how many years or what success you achieved or not because in real life there nothing happens except living  you live each moment and each moment seizes you while you are looking to seize the momenti think they did a good job with the last movie. often with in movie series the quality just sinks with each movie that comes out but with lord of the rings i really think they found a way to avoid that. i am a huge fan of the books and the films really was a good surprise where movie adaption of books usually disappoints i was really surprised. everything was just great not only with this movie but with all of them. music locations actors and dialog. peter jackson is a world class director and with these movies i really feels that he shows that. everything was great. recommend to check out the movies and would encourage everyone to try the books.i think the return of the king was the best ending. the acting was great and the special effects were spectacular. it was smart of peter jackson to do the trilogy during an era when motion picture technology involved computers. without computers it would have been difficult to make this trilogy. i enjoyed the superb acting of orlando bloom as legolas john rhys-davies as gimli ian mckellen for gandalf and viggo mortensen for aragorn. the four hobbits were performed by great actors. the battle in the pelennor fields and minas tirith was the best fight sequence i have ever seen in a motion picture. it defeats star wars and the matrix combined. the battle seen is the victor of the movies since its beginning. arwen had little importance but focusing on one hobbit named frodo is not good for attention grabbing. the alternation of scenes was the best way to keep the audience up. arwen was important to the last installment because it shows her love for aragorn. the ending could have been shorter but overall the film has little errors and more achievements.i think the dark knight is greatest film of all time .it is my all time favorite film. dark knight is not only considered as the best comic adaptation but also greatest film of time . christian bale has done a beautiful job as batman/bruce wayne.he is charismaticfearless and driven. he is the hero gotham deserves . when it comes to bad guys  heath ledger portrayal as joker is psychoticscary and mind blowingrip heath ledger.best joker performance in cinema history. aaron eckhart has done a great job as harvey dent/two face. gary old man returns as james gordon . nolan has done a great job.just the right amount action suspensethrillcomedy and drama . i love the way nolan has symbolized both character.batman stands for justice and order and the other hand we have joker stands for madness and chaos.and the war between them is just epic.... thank you nolan.i think the big question...or the question everyone actually cares about is this: is christopher nolans follow up to the critically acclaimed 2005 film batman begins the dark knight as good as everyone is saying quite simply yes yes it is. there is no doubt about it one of the most anticipated movies of the 21st century duly deserves every amount of praise lavished onto it. this is no ordinary superhero movie this is a character and dialogue driven piece not as action orientated as you might expect. i will not go into plot details because there is a lot of it. however a basic one sentence summary is: batman now has to face his most cunning and psychotic enemy someone with no real motives...the joker. now that that is out of the way i will start off with the actors and boy is there a lot to talk about. christian bale has done a tremendous job as our beloved caped crusader with him already blowing everyone else out of water with batman begins. bruce wayne has a flawed personality that hangs on the balance between righteousness and criminal. his perception of justice causes an emotional and personal shift whether he is a wealthy businessman who fights crime in a gadget-riddled suit or just a normal man who is sick of all the scum in gotham city and decides to give the law-breakers a dose of their own medicine. because of this and bales tremendous acting bruce wayne is justified and we emphasise with bales flawed hero more than any of the other actors. if there ever was an excellent batman this is it. the theme of right and wrong is played well with his character here. of course i am sure you all want know if heath ledger was that good. and i can safely say that he most definitely was. ledgers joker is not only the best but is now the greatest superhero film villain ever. his performance is truly terrifying chilling brillianti think that this movie was very interesting. i also think that it is a very good movie. a movie for the family. i enjoyed the movie very much. i enjoyed every part of it. i believe the actor that plays the dark knight did a wonderful job. i dont think anyone could have done better. i recommend this movie. i recommend it for familys and everyone else as long as you are 13 and up. i hope anyone and/or everyone who watches this movie enjoys it as much as i did. i enjoyed the dark knight because it was interesting and well written and directed. i look forward to a sequel. in conclusion i enjoyed the dark knight very much and i would recommend it to you.i think that i might have ruined this movie for myself i watched this movie over and over ad nauseum in my 20s i think that parts of it are dated and should remain in the 90s vault but i think that for the most part this movie is transcendent for anyone whos ever read my other comments youll know that my idea of a masterpiece is a movie that pulsates with a mystical otherworldly vibe and id have to say that most of this movie is like that this movie has been parodied by the likes of the simpsons and been referenced by serious critics and for good reason this movie definitely resonates with the archetypal sophomore vibei think that almost everything that can be said about this trilogy has been said already but still i will try. there are so many films that destroyed the beauty and perfection of the novels they have been built upon not this one. in front of an amazingly beautiful scenery peter jackson was able to create a fantasy-movie which unlike so many others before did not deal with old clichÍ©s and thus is far away from any trash-movie a lot of people had expected it to be beforehand. although i am sure that the cast of this film will soon be forgotten the the lord of the rings-trilogy will stand the times and be one of the most renowned pictures of the las decade.i think pulp fiction is the geatest gangster movie of all time i like mob films but this is the best in history it is extremley bloody films i think that samuel jackson bruce willis and travolta have acted their best in the film i am big fan of this film and i would put it in the top 3 of my favourite my favorite part is where jules shoots bret in the arm that part is actually quite funny i would definitely rate this as a ten if there was a rating over ten it would go to the top i think the 3 actors and quentin tarantino a adding part of the moviei think my fan-boy mode has just kicked in. there are just so many good things about this movie i just... oh my god excuse me... i need a moment. the acting is excellent with the best performance coming from heath ledger the story is great the characters and the way they are portrayed are wonderful batman is most definitely my favorite fictional character of all time as well as my favorite superhero. the morals of this movie are also really great and very thought provoking. it really makes us question ourselves and society as we know it. the whole thing about batman being the dark knight as opposed to harveys white knight is incredible and serves as the basis of why i love batman so much. as a comic book fan i think that it was incredible faithful to the source material which is mainly the comic book the long halloween but it also has influences from the killing joke which is one of my favorite comic book stories. all in all i think the dark knight is an excellent film and deserved those oscars. 9.5 to 10 out of 10 for me.i think is safe to say that this is one of the masterpieces of cinema that the industry was missing. this movie has everything unbelievable performances amazing photography and a really deep connection to every character everybody has a meaning from bruce wayne to the swat officers everybody has a meaning this is by far my favorite movie ever. the scrip is almost perfect from start to finish is entertaining and you start to grow a lot of emotions towards all the characters this movie is a trip into a lot of emotional feelings from joy to sympathy and ending in hope. is impossible not to talk about the eternal heath in this movie this is one of the best performances that i have ever seen in a movie specifically in a villain theres memorable villains in cinema history but heath gives a performance that remind us every one of them heaths joker has a little of the sadism of norman stansfield leon 1994 the cold blood of john doe se7en 1995 and the dark humor of tyler durden fight club 1999 but creating a very original and even darker and scarier villain which is impressive and absolutely difficult for a pg13 rated movie he absolutely deserved every award given to him not because of the hype of his death but because of the quality of his work this was his masterpiece. but even though he had the perfect chemistry with the other characters he was the perfect antagonist for christian bales bruce wayne which was an impressive performance alfred dent gordon fox and dawes were also fantastic and they were perfect for each other. is safe to say that this is a masterpiece and is going to be hard work to surpass the quality of this film.  real art that inspires you to look at the deeper aspects of life and the world around you. the shawshank redemption delivers much-needed breath of fresh air for anyone who realizes the capability of film. it proves that masters of the craft still live on this earth and still bless us with timeless masterpieces that we will never forget.these artists show their capability to produce art  real art that inspires you to look at the deeper aspects of life and the world around you...i think film is the most successful in the entire series. i dont want to say much about it because whatever is said cannot do it justice there is enough hype surrounding its release but its there for a reason. top notch film. bravo to nolan and his crew for giving a movie that batman truly deserves. the action is great and the plot is more deeper and engrossing. i applaud christopher nolan christian bale and especially heath ledger who sadly passed away earlier this year and all those aboard for believing in mr. nolans talents for this second installment. although some may feel a bit of melancholy over ledgers death but as a final note i will say this sincerely from my heart: remember heath ledger and honor him in your minds and hearts not only for his performances but as a human being and father to his daughter matilda ledger. may we issue him best wishes for his family and friends and his daughter for years to come.i suppose that someone sometime may tell the story more accurately but i doubt very much that it will ever be told better. nothing could ever replace the books for pure escapism but peter jackson has managed to evoke both the feel and texture of tolkiens masterwork without pandering too much to clichÍ©d hollywood extravagance. the cast are superb if sir ian mckellen is remembered for nothing else other than gandalf i feel sure he would not complain the cinematography stunning and the pace even over the 8/9 hours for the whole trilogy is matchless. for those who have read the books as i have for many years i would suggest watching once to get all of the niggling storyline changes/omissions out of your system then just watch as a pure wonderous unadulterated piece of epic epic cinema. im sure i will love it forever.i still remember the first time that i watched this movie. i expected going into watching the lotr trilogy for some kind of nerd fest full of terrible acting and cringe inducing action scenes. instead what i got was probably my favorite film trilogy of all time. everything truly spoke to me. every part of these movies i have loved and always love. the final movie in the trilogy the return of the king is my personal favorite out of the three. the awe inspiring action scenes wonderful effects and the touching themes that can be found in this classic tale. this is definitely a film worth watching again and again and again. it is one of those great movies that will stand the test of time and will never get too old to watch.  except the fact i hate frodo well thats just me personally because hes such a fanny the movie isnt bad at all. its actually a very good way to end the triolegy. but the ending really there were like 8 different endings to that movie showed us what happened with every da*n characters from legolas to frodo. we dont care 40 minutes of ending that sucked and pretty much destroyed the expectations. also too many dialogs i understand that theres plenty of plot but still they could have cut some of them and leave them for the really-big-fans-ill-watch-lotr-for-7hours. i suggest watch it cut the movie 35 minutes before the ending. rols rois out :] i started watch the film and my first thought was that its very boring film the boring story and boring actors and i wanted to finished this film but after a while i watch it in shock mind blowing story secrets of main protagonists were very dizzy and i cant break away from screen wow its only word that i could say after film i dont like family drama i rather to a fantastic or horror film but it hit me in my heart ive still in shock for a few days every people have secret and it may occur everybody this film show unusual people in unusual smasterpieceituation what i can say about director he make a masterpiece with a the best actorsi see that 700 and some people have given this movie a rating of 1 what a bunch of melarchy there is so much packed into pulp fiction that most movies asked to deliver the same would buckle under the weight the acting is great its nice to see travolta in a real movie the editing and story boarding are classic actually they helped redefine the term classic in the genre excellent movie a must see [perfect 10] rip mike sackmani saw this movie for the first time 8 years ago. i just happened to see it by chance on cable because i never heard about the shawshank redemption before. after watching the movie i was immensely impressed and positively surprised. definitely this is the best movie ive ever seen. the story the direction and the cast specially tim morgan and gil bellows are perfect the shawshank redemption really deserves that spot in the rankings. this movie is a must see the movie not only offers a great viewing experience but also a lesson to take home. wish more movies are made in this fashion instead of the blood and gore that people seem to appreciate nowadays. thanks for reading this review.i saw this movie and i wanted to rush to imdb to write a review about how incredible this movie is but instead i decided to wait and let the movie sink in for a little while i have been thinking about this movie for two days pretty much the whole day not many movies do this to me then i saw the movie again and it was just as incredible as the first time i saw it i dont want to give too many details or even any on the story because you just have to see it for yourself ive read some of the negative reviews and those people mostly complain about the laws of physics being broken yes some of the things done in this movie are complete fiction and others are theoretically possible but the genre is called science fiction so distorting some truth is perfectly fine in my booki saw this film in 2008 for the first time and have since watched it over 30 times as i just cant get enough of the lotrs trilogy. i loved the film so much and the lotrs is now my all time favourite film series. it lives up to its previous two films and leaves you wishing for another film. i totally recommend watching the lotrs trilogy as all three of the films are absolutely phenomenal. the return of the king is a great film that rounds of the trilogy nicely it has the quest to take the ring to mount doom and many battle scenes with orcs surrounding minas tirith. the fellowship carry out the rest of the journey separately as they do not stay together until the end.i saw this completely for the first time since i saw it at the theater 4 years ago i dont know how i couldve lived this long without seeing this masterpieceee and i hadnt realized how completely awesome this film is i absolutely loved it the story follows batman where we left him at the end of batman begins released in 2005 trying to still cope with the death of his parents and having to face his most infamous enemy: the joker. the story here is central to the movie and is everywhere. but it is also very emotional epic and sometimes it even has some deeper philosophical meaning to it. even though bb was pretty dark and totally different from past bat movies this one goes even darkerr it makes the villains a lot more realistic that ras in bb which was basically a ninja. here the joker is just an ordinary crazy guy who like alfred quotes at some point in the movie just wants to watch the world burn. the acting here is what sells the movie in my opinion. i mean michael caine as alfred morgan freeman as lucius fox gary oldman as jim gordon and of course heath ledger as joker all deserve special mentions as they all deliver awesome roles i mean seriously the joker is so scary and disturbing in this but at the same time we know why he does this as nolan delves deeply in both the psychology of joker and batman. ledger delivers the performance of his career in this r.i.p heath you will be missedd : hes absolutely brilliant as is the rest of the cast including bale as batman whose only gripe i have with his acting is the stupid voice he makes when he puts on the suit. its so cartoonish and distracting >_< but ledger definitely steals the show. special effects and editing are really good here with the former is even more satisfactorily showcased if you watch the film on bluray which makes everything look absolutely gorgeous every airborne shot in this is epic. also the music is also something which enhances the experience in a truly remarkable way. the main theme here is so awesome and overall the music in this composed by known composer hans zimmer just makes the movie all the more exciting and emotional when it needs to be. overall this movie is a must-see for any bat-fan superhero movie or comic book fan out there. the acting story music etc... everything is just so perfectly balanced to create an even better and epicker i know ive said the word epic in pretty much every paragraph in this review but cut me some slack i love this movie xddd film than its already superb predecessor.i saw the dark knight about three years ago when i was in the 8th grade. and i was blown away at how beautifully done it was the camera work the acting the story it all took me by surprise. it is to this day one of the best movies i have ever seen or will see. no other movie can impact you in such an intense way than the dark knight. it is a movie worth seeing due to the fact that the workers put so much time and effort into this one film and they did not want to waste money putting up garbage. so christopher nolan thank you for not wasting our time instead earning our time with this film. to this day i still am anxious to see the movie at home. i recommend it to anyone who likes action movies in general. to anyone who doesnt dont waste your time write bad reviews about this film.i saw pulp fiction back in 1995 on video i was amazed can you really make a movie like this a film with too much bad language violence booze and drugs its just too incredible to describe but it has it all and above everything else it has quentin tarantino a man with great bad taste he came up with the stories picked the music for the sound track wrote the screenplay and directed and made john travolta a star again samuel l jackson and uma thurman reached a-status in hollywood people dont realize what an achievement that was anymorei saw it on the opening night in houston tx and it was very much appreciated there was sounds of appreciation during the movie from the viewers and certainly much clapping at the end and sorry this may be a spoiler bit when obamas head exploded all good fun dont take it too seriously however and it was certainly poking fun at britishness and previous films but in a fun way no one i spoke too had a bad word for it it was well paced and kept you involved all the cast were good but samuel l jackson was terrific although a certain resemblance to bond movies it made its own distinctive style i am guessing there will be a follow upi rented this movie the other night and finished watching it for the first time about an hour ago i thought it was one of the most interesting movies ive ever seen ive seen a lot of famous excellent movies in the past month or two and even though most of them are extremely good pulp fiction will certainly be one of the most memorablei remember when i was back in the 08. the dark knight its a movie that everyone can think its about the joker. well the joker is awesome but its not entirely him in this picture. chris nolan is a genius. this man has create a realistic world when everything in the screen can easily happen in real life. the shoots the screenplay everything is perfect. this is easily the best superhero movie of all time. the performances are ok but heres when ledgers steals the show. his performance is so perfect very different from the others jokers. this joker is a insane man who lives of creating caos you can see that in the scene of the money burning and in the end. this man not steal not cheat but expends his own money to create caos. simply brilliant. the dark masterpiece like everyone says to it. chris nolan we are waiting for rises.i remember when i used to not like fantasy movies that much i thought what most people think. cheesy/unrealistic/weird/freaky...you get the point. when i saw the 1st film i changed my mind i found myslef not only liking it but i loved it. the characters grow on you and they are oustanding in the last film elijah woods performance of frodo was particularly good. these movies may seem childish to some people...but if you begin to accept it for all its magic battles and creatures you see something else. this isnt just a bunch of fancy words with wizards and fairy-tale creatures....its truly a wonderful story that is as real as anything. do yourself a favor watch these movies. youll be glad you did because the last one is truly amazing. ive yet to see a better film and i dont think i ever will.i remember when i first got to see pulp fiction i knew absolutley nothing about this film id not even seen a poster or a review nor had i seen resivoir dogs although id seen posters for res dogs all over the place i cant remember who i watched this film with but the thing that struck me was the opening scene followed by the opening credits they hit me like a brick in the face with the music the likes of which id never heard in film before setting the scene for the fantasic film that was to follow i was transfixed before pulp fiction id relied on more unintelligable action films to provide me with my film entertainment films like terminator 2 star wars or jurassic park all good films themselves but all relying on big explosions special effects and action to bring me entertainment but it was pulp fiction with its second to none dialogue brilliant casting and great sound track that finally made me realise that you dont need a bigger explosion a faster car chase or more arse kicking kung fu fights to make a more exciting or interesting filmi remember watching this film when i was 13 the film changed my entire view of films and what they could be i used to only watch the films the had super-action in them from when i was 8 up to when i was 13 my favorite films were terminator 2 die hard and predator now i still think that those are good films especially the first two but now my eyes were open to a whole new world of film i had never heard of talking for the sake of talking do what the characters say have anything to do with the plot what so ever not most of the time but those conversations are probably the most important thing in the movie it helps tell who the character is faster than anything else could the performances in the film were all outstanding im not mad that travolta didnt win for best actor hanks was brilliant as forrest gump but i do think samuel l jackson should have gotten a lot of awards for his performance as jules harvey keital was absolutely brilliant as the wolf his episode was my favorite of all of them a lot of people have ripped off tarantinos style but now it seems that every film that has violence in it is compared to tarantino i think he had a huge inpact on the film industry but not that big otherwise he is my favorite filmmaker out there right now he has yet to dissapoint me 10/10i remember the first time i watched this film. when the last scene was over and the ending credits started rolling i felt some kind of a shudder. i was thrilled. what had just ended couldnt just be a movie or a simple film. i had witnessed something far more important. it was the most exhilarating experience i ever had. there is something about these 25 hours that makes it something of a bigger statement. its granted that its the best movie in the superhero genre ever but i would argue that it could be one of the best films in general. here you have an amazing script written by cristopher and jonathan nolan covering issues like friendship family loss death madness politics pain and suffering failures and lies commitment and justice even technology and of course chaos. you have the excellent direction from one of the greatest directors of our time cristopher nolan. if you really think about it the main protagonist is wearing a suit that resembles a bat and running the streets with some kind of tank trying to save the world. and yet it translates on the big screen as if its a great tragic story taking place in the real world. as for other important recognitions: wally pfister does an amazing work at cinematography and hans zimmer with james newton howard decided to give us the most amazing  in years. it all went so great mainly because of the great collaboration between the director and everyone else. nolan is proving to be really trying at getting the best out of his crew... and his attempts to keep every aspect of his work at the top level is shown without denying in the dark knight. im sure you can all understand why its pretty clear that the best thing in the movie is the performances. if anyone told me that he managed to watch this movie and not chill at least for one time while the joker was on screen... well i would not believe him. heath ledger as the joker is resilient. his representation of this comic book character is epic. take cristopher nolans script and execute it in a perfect way... then take out heath ledger and replace him. it would still be great but never the same. he elevated everything. ledger was the only and perfect choice to play the joker who for many years to come will represent the absolute and complete villain. but its not just the incomparable ledger. christian bales act is so unique  there is nothing to say. it is just exceptionally plain good. a must to see movie for everyone that carries a heart. i remember i saw the movie in the theater and i was just mesmerized by the performance of heath ledger. the acting was so unique and superb in every way that him passing away makes a movie lover very sad. not only the acting caught my attention but the screenplay as well. such lines as: some men just want to watch the world burn and its all about sending a message when joker burns all the money. you can feel the chills even now cant you what i like about the movie is that it doesnt only tell the tale of a hero but the whole movie is sending a message that people can change things together. as for the ending i think joker shouldve got a better ending. i mean we dont get to know where he was taken and what happened to him after batman caught him. but thats a minor mistake in my opinion. the movie is perfect. highly recommended  in heres where you need it most he says. you need it so you dont forget. forget that there are places in the world that arent made out of stone. that theres a - theres a - theres something inside thats yours that they cant touch. red morgan freeman doesnt think much of andy at first picking that tall glass o milk with the silver spoon up his ass as the first new fish to crack. andy says not a word and losing his bet red resents him for it. but over time as the two get to know each other they quickly become the best of friends. this again is one of the films major strengths. many movies are about love many flicks have a side-kick to the hero but shawshank is the only one i can think of that looks honestly at the love between two best friends. it seems odd that hollywood would skip this relationship time and again when its a feeling that weighs so much into everyones day to day lives. perhaps its too sentimental to seem conventional but shawshanks core friendship hits all the right notes and the film is much better for it. its pacing is deliberate as well. as we spend the film watching the same actors it is easy to forget that the movies timeline spans well over 20 years. such a huge measure of time would pass slowly in reality and would only be amplified in prison. and its not as if the film lacks interest in these moments. it still knows where its going it merely intends on taking its sweet time getting there. it pays off as well as the tedium of prison life makes the climax that much more exhilarating. for anyone who sees it it is a moment never to be forgotten. with themes of faith and hope there is a definite religious subtext to be found here. quiet selfless and carefree andy is an obvious christ figure. warden norton bob gunton is obviously modeled on richard nixon who in his day was as close to a personified satan as they come. but if you arent looking for subtexts the movie speaks to anyone in search of hope. it is a compelling drama and a very moving film perfectly written acted and shot. they just dont come much better than this. overall : 9.8/10 = a+ the shawshank redemption served as a message of hope to hollywood as well. more than any film in memory it proved there is life after box office. besting forrest and fiction it ran solely on strong word of mouth and became the hottest rented film of 1995. it currently sits at #2 in the imdbs top 250 films occasionally swapping spots with the godfather as the top ranked film of all time -- redemption indeed. if you havent seen it yet what the hell are you waiting for as andy says it comes down a simple choice really. either get busy living or get busy dying. i remember first watching this movie and yes ive watched it many times. it was at a movie theater with my father. at the end of the movie i kind of just sat there and then looked at my dad. he just looked at me and said that was a good movie wasnt it the theatrics in this movie are astounding. this movie will have you on the edge wondering how and where the story will develop and go. christopher nolan was an excellent pick for batman and ill be disappointed to see him go. the joker despite his horrid persona adds suspense and a mix of unpredictable action. if you havent purchased this movie or are thinking about purchasing this movie ill save you the time and just tell you to go ahead and purchase it. you wont regret it.  what is so good about this film isit the story the director the actors or maybe just all of this things. i mean what makes this the best movie ever made isit the feel-good feeling in the end i dont know a person whose doest feel good after this movie. tims and morganss performances both deserved oscar but im not gonna takeit from tom hanks that his performance in forres gump also deserved oscar. so if anyone can tell me the one thing that makes this the best movie ever made. i remember being one of the select few of being a bit overly excited hearing that guardians was about to get their big screen debut yes i knew it was a huge gamble honestly it was a winwin situation for them if it was good then mcu could bring any character to life if it was bad it was a lesson learned pair them up with the avengers like in the comics and continue on a lot of people werent thrilled about this but i kept my hopes high last night i was able to catch the movie on the night of july 31st holy crap this movie delivered i loved everything about this film it had everything it was hard for me to dislike any one on the team though rocket and groot were the stars of these losers starlord gamora and draxhell even yondu was nice one thing i really liked that had a bit of an advantage over the avengers was that they all sacrificed for each other they grew into a family the more and more the film developed the only gripe i had about the movie was i wish thanos was just a tad bit more in here ronan was cool but just didnt hit a home run maybe got to 3rd base but nothing past that what more can i say about this? easily the first 10 giving out from me in a long time you will laugh you will cryhave that tear in your eye never thought i would say that for a marvel film but you will even find yourself dancing stay for the end credits duh sit back and enjoy the nostalgia i wish i could have given this higher than a 10i really wish i could shake quentins hand for this one he has really done it this is mr tarantino at his very best i know there are some low-minded people who dont like this type of a violent and - in the same time - awfully funny film containing drugs shooting and guns but i most certainly love it actually i dont think this film is a very violent onei know this is only my opinion and maybe im used to watch violent films or something well check out tarantinos from dusk till dawn theres a bloody film with lots of splatter still the big difference between for example from dusk till dawn and this one is the fact that from dusk till dawn is pure entertainment with no meaning of any kind and this is a very smart movie ive seen this film about a million times but its never even slightly boring outstanding script and wonderful actors: simply one of the best movies ive ever seen truly a masterpiecei really wanted to watch this movie when it first came out but i didnt get a chance. i was so desperate to see why everyone was raving about it. when i saw it i automatically knew why. i instantly loved it. everything about this film is brilliant. the superbly written smart and witty script has been suitably chosen for each character. the suspense that is built up in some scenes is done extremely well with the choppy editing by lee smith. wally pfisters camera work is outstanding. but what is probably the best thing about the film is the acting. each actor does the role of their character magnificently well. none more so then heath ledger. his portrayal of the evil joker is so amazingly good that i still feel chills down the back of my spine every time he appears on screen. a film that can be loved by people who arent really batman fans. 10/10i really love how quentin tarentio reuses his cast through out his movies every main character from his previous hit reservoir dogs made some kind of appearance in pulp fiction not only do the actors tie his individual movies together but if you look back from his current movies to some of his first films you can usually find a little microcosm from that film that he used as a base to create a new film the movie had a good rhythm even with the scenes being out of order it defiantly keeps you thinking about the film and how the story really played out this film is pretty violent but not as much as tarentios newer films tarentio has his own style and is totally an auteur director of the modern film profession i would highly recommend seeing his films but be ready for some extreme violencei really like this movie. i love batman. i must say that this is one of the best films ive seen i like it much better than batman begins but i think that it ended too fast and that two face shouldnt have died.. this movie is one of the best movies on the planet because of heath ledgers portrayal of the joker. the story is so exciting and you are waiting with anticipation to see what happens next. the film sees batman confront the joker as he gets trapped in his twisted little games along the way. if you havent seen this movie get out there and buy it because im telling you that you wont regret it. i give the film a 10/10.i really hate those censorious critics. when everyone is saying the dark knight is truly one of the top five movies in the whole history and the movie itself is becoming really popular someone laughs coldly and says things like this is the most overrated movie ever made. and if you go deeper to their ideas you find all they have done is pick up the small detailed flaws of the movie which is completely not affecting the whole quality and worthiness of seeing more than twice of the movie. hey boy why so serious i wonder if those people work in a watch factory in which you are never allowed to make a single tiny mistake because if you do you will ruin the whole work. movie is art and art is never perfect. its imperfection is the very thing that makes it amazing. the dark knight is not perfect or in other word can anyone name a literally perfect movie is godfather perfect or the shawshank redemption but they are indeed amazing arent they i really think the dark knight should be even longer maybe three hours will do. this is a so complex multi-layer script for many directors its too hard to tell the story and make it clear to the audience. the nolans made it although not 100 percent but they did make it understood plus shining plus intriguing if the movie were long enough the story-telling would be even more clear and very importantly not that tied up which is the biggest shortage of the dark knight. then its time to talk about why it is so amazing. i hate to say everything in the movie is great because thats over-simplifying and showing no respect for the standing out. the joker its him who makes the movie different. its not only about heaths actingactually i have no idea how to describe how great his acting is it simply defies description its about the role. many marvel that this joker is the no1 villain of the history indeed he is why because he never deserves anyones mercy in other words he is in absolute terms bad bad enough to go way beyond the punishment people make to measure the fierceness of bad. he is a villain that will stay longer in your heart and control your thoughts than your best hero image can do. a hero is an examplei really enjoyed this movie the soundtrack was cool surprising and unique i was glad that the songs that peter listened to werent there just there to punch up a scene i might have chosen different songs but these songs were perfect and chris pratts peter is such a contemporary and real guy that no matter how odd situations became his reactions and utterances made everything seem plausible i only had a quibble with the narrow metaphorical background which seems to be a constant in most super hero films i wont go into details here just suffice it to say that when i saw chris pratts other film the lego movie i was encouraged to see the idea of the one relegated to the position of nonsense i loved it when morgan freemans wise man states that the reason that his prophesy is true is based on the fact that it rhymes back to guardians  the plot and script were solid the graphics were just amazing i watched the 3d version and it is excellent i always feel like 2d films are really missing something after a good 3d viewing and this 3d film is superb i do think that we are on some strange path of always having to one up the mayhem levels of previous films and i think that it does not make the drama more effective to continually raise the body count what is our intent in making films? i think we could make better films with less mindless darkness zombies and vampires and fears oh myi really dont like to jump on a band wagon like this. though i had been longing for this movie for over a year and though i was expecting great things from it this nerdy and geeky talk of comic book fans best movie ever really got onto my nerves. living in germany i had to wait until yesterday to finally watch the movie and i could watch all the craziness going on on the net from afar. i still wanted to like the movie but i really feared that all this hype might ruin it for me. well now that i have finally seen it i have to say that my fears were to a large part unnecessary. the movie is great and i think it is as good as a movie like this can be. though i still get annoyed by teenagers who yell that this is the best movie ever i can understand where they are coming from. every decade or so there is one movie that becomes a real phenomenon. and if you never experienced this than you become part of the group that says this is our movie and we wont let grumpy idiots take it away from us. when i was at that age for me it was jurassic park and later to a certain extent also titanic and i bet most of the kids who hype this movie have not been consciously around then. i thought the acting was great overall. heath ledger definitely stands out. christian bale is great too. his work as the twisted batman/bruce wayne character has to be a lot more subtle in this movie and he achieves that wonderfully. unfortunately due to ledgers tour de force performance bales work seems to go unappreciated by many here. i could go on and on. there is not a single weak performance in this movie although the mayor becomes a bit distracting because of his heavy eye-liner but thats not the actors fault. i love the scope of this movie. the main storyline is always in focus but there still is room for subplots here and there which are all set up perfectly and fit within the overall plot. and even though you might wish to see more of some characters like alfred you nevertheless dont feel that they were underused. the pacing is great as well. you keep being interested the entire time and the movie flows so naturally that you never get the feeling that this action sequence here happens because there has to be an action sequence. so is this the best movie ever i leave that up to everyone to decide for himself. it is not perfect but no movie even the best is completely flawless. there are things in this movie that i didnt like too much. i wish they had done more with two-face and the whole bit about the cell phones seemed a bit gimmicky for me i also didnt like batmans eyes in these scenes. but there is so much to like in this film. one has to applaud the filmmakers for going against conventions by for example killing of characters not just at the climax of the movie but right in the middle. i also loved it that the movie does not end with the big machine of the villain that he has to start in order to rule the world even batman begins fell into that trap. they found a perfectly neat solution to it all and though i think the ending is not perfect i think it still is great as it is. the same thing can be said about the whole movie. i love it that the script of this movie is so smart that it even takes time to ask philosophical questions. sure it doesnt go too deep but it is mentioned in a way that most moviegoers will be able to think about this. i had a perfect time at the cinema and think that for what it is this movie can indeed be called a masterpiece.i read the books before the films were made i was part of a reading group that discussed only the work of tolkien and all that. the movies for me at the time and until today are amazing. of course the return of the king as a sum of all the finales you have in all those histories told by tolkien at the same time is just flawless. i cried in all the ending as i had cried when i was reading. those characters are part of my life. this history is part of my life. some of my best friends are still part of our old reading group and even my fiancÍ© is the amazing girl that though we really bet somewhere else i got to really know in this same group. i think that there arent some many histories like this one that can connect people like me and my friends so profoundly.i read about this movie and i was told it took 11 years to be finished so that the actors could grow up as the movie was being made then i saw the title and read the plot and decided to give this a try it turned out to be the best decision of the month maybe of the year not only boyhood is extremely good its also relatable the film may be 3 hours long but i only noticed how long it was when it was actually over its that kind of film that keeps you thinking about anything in life in your life and it might be life changing for you as it was to the main character despite not having the most famous cast every single actor portrays a brilliant role and each one of the main characters shine the whole movie i highly recommend this one because you never know when were having a film as good as thisi personally think this is the best movie ever made now that is not to say it is my favorite movie to watch that isnt exactly true but i have yet watched a movie with a better interpretation of graphics storyline and overall entertainment. i found myself trudging through fellowship of the ring entertained by two towers and then blown away by return of the king i love this movie and though it would eventually get old as it is not my favorite movie it comes in a close second behind my favorite revenge of the sith. still excellent movie and kudos to peter jackson and his like two seconds on screen getting shot by legolas he made a truly spectacular movie. i recommend it to all my friends.i personally loved the film it is an impressionist film its about feelings and images and if you try to analyse individual strokes  the picture falls apart but so is metropolis albeit metropolis has a much better musical  despite the film shortcomings of which i will talk extensively i still give it 10 stars as its been a while since a movie would really engage me on some deeper levels of course there are plot gaps and the film stumbles sometimes dragging painfully slow sometimes rushing through skipping over but even despite the lack of consistency and attention to writing it brought me to magical places and i consider it to be one of the greatest movies ive seen up to date interstellar is evidently inspired by the 2001 space odyssey and i think christopher nolan in his attempt perhaps moved one step closer to making some of the ideas that kubrick expressed more palatable in case of 2001 space odyssey i appreciate the idea and feeling behind it but find it excruciatingly painful to endure long minutes of watching one cardboard piece slowly sliding on top of another  especially in this age where the audience is spoiled by the hyperrealistic cgi renderings just in case one have heightened expectations of the movie here are things that are wrong about interstellar and one should be prepared for it since the film is not about space at all  its about human emotions and also circumstances where our humanity would fall apart and reassemble itself differently interstellar is inherently impressionist and symbolic like metropolis where form and meaning of symbols take precedence over their literal meaning or technical implementation interstellar sacrifices a lot here are some of the things that are wrong with the film  overexaggerations and often stretched emotions where normal people would behave differently  massive plot holes and often lack of reason on behalf of the characters  bearable but mediocre musical   sketchy and shallow characters unreasonable immature adults behaving like spoiled teenagers  science touches some advanced topics while falling short at basics strictly speaking the movie is not science fiction i wish that christopher nolan for his next project would involve more mature and qualified people in writing pay attention to detail and spend more time in making characters more believable  i think by now he can certainly afford it that being said in my opinion interstellar is perhaps his best work up to date where for me personally its certainly more important than his other masterpiece dark knight as the latter was a form of high quality entertainment while interstellar is something to be inspired with speaking of the film  hans zimmer is definitely among my least favourite film composers he is not a composer at all a good sound designer at times but he cant do any music the loud minimalist  with organ chords sketchy piano notes and synths at times was reminiscent of also sprach zarathustra used in the kubriks movie and that created a certain atmosphere but the rest of the  if one would look for a positive word to describe it is hardly anything more than bearablei never saw this film on the silver screen. i didnt want to see it on video either. the video store owner implored me to watch it and i remember my emphatic reply. im not watching a 3 hour film about a prison con doing tax returns for the guards. fortunately for me this video store owner was a mightily persistent sort and i begrudgingly walked home not knowing that i had just rented the greatest film ever made. this film received no hype nor the mega-bucks publicity given to a lot of movie trash out there. because they didnt need to - all they needed to do was to let people watch it because word of mouth is the best marketing ticket in town. and so it proved. the movie is long and relies on a storyline which has been covered many times. wrongful conviction brutality in jail justice in the end. but it is the way in which the story is told and acted out that defines it quite rightly as imdbs top ranked film. i dont care for stephen king as an author but his vivid imagination coupled with his skill at telling a story a short story in this case is top drawer. we have a man dufresne who after being convicted wrongfully for murder uses his accounting skills in jail solely to survive. red freeman the man who can get things befriends him. the story then slowly unravels with shocking scenes of brutality intertwined with flickers of how the human spirit can overcome the most hazardous odds. the warden samuel norton is magnificent as a man whose corruption has spiralled out of control and will do almost anything to retain the status quo. clancy brown as the brutal guard completes the double act. the story twists and turns leaving the audience not quite knowing whether we are in for a harrowing or euphoric ending. and when the ending comes on that mexican beach you can almost hear the triumphant cheers ringing around the cinema halls. this is film making at its very best and it is highly unlikely that robbins and freeman will ever better it. its one of those few occasions where 10 stars is not nearly high enough. so if you have been living under a rock or are as sceptical as i was in the early 90s then its time for me to adopt my friendly video store owners guise and say watch this - its the best film ever made.i need to go again so i can see more of the movie - my first viewing was not enough to see everything. i must admit to being slightly disappointed by a couple of things: - i felt that the palantir were not done well at all - no explanation and context seemed wrong - much i guess due to the cutting of sarumans scenes. as an avid reader of the books i missed the mouth of sauron the mustering of the allies before pelennor fields saurumans downfall and ultimate end during the scouring of the shire. my other issue is one that i guess cannot be overcome in movie adaptions of books and that is the loss of almost all of tolkeins rich historical fabric of middle earth. to even attempt it would have required a voice over which i dont think would have worked. these minor nitpicks aside so many things were excellent: - the aerial tracking shot of gandalf and pippin riding up through the 7 rings of minas tirith the witch king preparing for war and his downfall at the hands of dernhelm grond the ride of the rhorrim shelob gollum samwise gamgee - sean astin acting his socks off compared to any previous work aragorn and all the men bowing to the four hobbits overall i think peter jackson and fellowship have crafted a truely excellent movie and a fitting end to the trilogy. i havent made up my mind whether it is the best of the three yet. i still favour fotr if only for the reason that it was the first and it so clearly proved that it was possible to make middle earth real on film and keep the spirit of the books.i myself like most people love this movie and whenever it got to the end where you see andy and red smiling and embracing on the beach it always sent chills through my soul but i realized that in addition to that sequence where not a word is spoken between the two men its that deep blue ocean that makes the ending so dramatic. i think with the exception of a few outdoor scenes in the movie where you see a little sky the bulk of the movie is shot in the drab gray tones of prison cause prison is drab and gray so when that big blue ocean hits your eyes it makes the whole experience of their freedom and the fact that they never gave up hope that much more dramatic. hope is definitely a good thing and quite possibly the best of all things.i must say that pulp fiction caught me totally surprised with its artistic story telling and dialogue quentin tarantino is the factor behind this and the cast are perfect for the story john travoltas performance here is probably the best ive ever seen from him and his dance here is the greatest he performed pulp fiction requires quiet a bit of thinking to endure the story because if youre the type who only likes special effects or who does not think and listen youll easily get turned off understanding what you hear and see here is the key and i recommend this film to anyone who can dont listen to those pro-life supporters anti-violence supporters special-effects-loversgo watch this film  beautiful but plain  action-packed but clever  touching but cynical  and oh these characters i love the film though i dont count tarantino a genius or something as you may think not i must say i was excited for this movie since the instant batman begins appeared on screen at the end of the first film. it was always going to be good and sadly it was always going to be over-hyped by the advertising warhorses. it is rare though that a movie can surpass all the hype and pass all expectations on the film. nolan the prestige begins delivers on more than the joker we remember from the old days of burton and nicholson. instead were given a psychopathic sadist who pleasures from sheer anarchy. all the hailing of ledgers performance are grounded. watching it will make you feel a different chill down your spine than youd remember from any other film. its impossible quite literally to relate to the joker. he gets inside your head with his stories of how he got his scars makes you laugh at his sick jokes then makes you instantly wonder why youre laughing. if ledger wasnt enough to horrify you - wait for harvey dent. brilliantly portrayed by aaron eckhart as gothams fallen white knight and batmans direct counterpart. his transformation will put tommy lee jones portrayal look like childrens breakfast cartoons. gyllenhaal had perfect chemistry with both bale and eckhart michael caine and morgan freeman both work well as batmans conscience and of course gary oldman as lieutenant gordon were all solid. there are some major differences between the dark knight and begins. firstly the music is extremely disconcerted compared with the majestic but unfinished tones of begins - but it suits the films tone: anarchy in every sense. there was a more solid singular villain compared with the many in begins - but there was also a lot more henchmen in tdk. the martial art direction was faster and more efficient - as mentioned in the film learning through experience. i was disappointed at the role of scarecrow in this film it just felt like a loose thread and wasnt quite closed up or explained and the ending while it wasnt what i expected others have said that it was predictable but for me it wasnt was solid and suited the film well. all in all this is a film that is quite close if it isnt already a masterpiece. nolan has a great thing going and unlike previous superhero adaptations spiderman and fantastic four for example there isnt campiness creeping in. in face if batman begins was 10/10 the dark knight deserves a 12. quite simply the best possible sequel that couldve been given. if you watch this which i implore that you do you certainly wont regret it. one of the best movies of 2008 ill wait till quantum of solace comes out before i pass judgement - but certainly a film worth getting excited for. if you dont like it then thats also fine - but keep in mind that you probably thought meet the spartans was a good movie so the rest of us wont take it to heart. stunning in every aspect and exceeds all hype and expectation... cant wait to watch it again or for the blu-rayi must admit i had my doubts whether this film would live up to the incredibly high standards set by the first two films but it has spectacularly succeeded. once again viggo mortensen delivers a polished and convincing performance as aragorn orlando bloom remains a very good legolas and elijah wood puts in a fantastic performance as frodo baggins. the special effects and computer generated scenes remain incredible and very difficult to tell from the real scenes especially during the epic final battle. i always think that the final film in a series is the most difficult as the director has to tie up any loose ends but peter jackson makes it look effortless - this is definitely one of the best films he has ever made. while the trilogy doesnt exactly follow the plot of the books and this film is no exception it still captures all of the ideas laid out in the books by j.r.r.tolkein. a must-watch film.i made my account on imdb just to rate this movie. :- i had heard from someone that tim robins has done a great job in this movie. but when i started watching this movie i could not move my ass for 142 min. its not just about tim robins or morgen freeman.. its the whole storylinedialogs and cinematography which insist you to watch this whenever you feel low in your life. movie has some great lines. when andytim robins brake the jail morgon freeman says i have to remind myself that some birds arent meant to be caged. their feathers are just too bright this movie has entertainment feelings action drama a little comedy. in short everything we want to see in a movie. i have seen this movie around 100 times and sure will watch more then 10000 times before i die. 1 of the best movies i have ever seen in my life.. wish i could see that sort of movie again in my lifei love this movie. it is one of my favorite movies of all time. of course the book is better it has more detail in it. but overall i think that the movie had some pretty awesome detail in it. i recommend this to anyone who has seen and liked the hobbit. if you are going to watch this movie then i suggest that you get prepared for random attacks jumping up in your seat from a monster on the screen or even get a little bit excited for the romance that is in the movies of the series. if you dont like harry potter this is still a good movie for you to watch. you should probably watch the movies in order because the last one will make like no sense what-so-ever. be prepared for action and adventure because that is what this movie is all about. thank you for taking time to read my review on the lord of the ringsthe return of the king.i love this movie it is a perfect mixture of crime joke and wisdoms quarterpounder = royal cheese since today i have seen this film a dozen times cant belief that this film is over 20 years old in my opinion this is the best tarantino movie every time i can recognize new things i love the para-language from john travolta and the black humor from samuel l jackson this movie has three different stories vincent vega and marsellus wallace wife golden watch and bonnie situation with no time chronology since today i have no idea what is in the suitcase  - i love this movie almost as much as the second in the trilogy my favorite movie. the one complaint even though it goes with the book perfectly is aragorns saving of gondor with the dead army. for some reason it just seems to easy for them to win like that but it is in the book. to make up for that battle just watch the extended edition of the final battle at the black gates of mordor which i loved. the whole story is such a great rendering of the book that i cant vote anything but a ten. some of my other favorite parts are when frodo wakes up at the end and when bilbo goes to live with the elves. if you want to know more about this series check out a book called the silmarilion which covers the making of the earth and the first and second ages. there are many references in the lord of the rings to events which happened before most of the characters time excepting the immortal elves of course. best trilogy ever.i love that line. every time samuel l. jackson or jules recites his line from he bible i am sitting there like wow. this is powerful stuff. and then bang. he shoots somebody. lets get it straight. quinten tarantino is a genius. as the movie goes the stories of 2 mobsters a mobsters wife a boxer and two restaurant robbers intertwine in absolutely the most perfect of ways. the two mobsters played by jackson and john travolta give two oscar nominated performances in order to bring their characters to life. uma thurman who plays marsellus wallaces wife. the scene where she is drugged out and vega travoltas character has to drive adrenaline through her heart i was sweating in my seat. so intense. bruce willis is also fantastic. such a great movie perhaps the greatest ensemble of acting in a movie. not a best picture winner however. i only say that because forrest gump is the greatest film of all time. but that being said pulp fiction wins in essentially any other year.i love pulp fiction there are no two ways about it from samuel l jacksons hip but stuck in the 70s gangster to ving vhames big and mean head gangster this movie provides no shortages of great acting this movie goes into several parts all kind of coming together in some way or another john travola plays in my opinion the role of his career as vincent vega he takes out out the head gangsters wife on an almost-fatal date she snorts herion and ill leave it to that i especially enjoyed bruce willis as the boxer i thought this was a great role for him he and the head ganster get in a massive fight and the gun-store owner and the sheriff do some repulsive things to the two of them christopher walken has a humorous cameo as the young boxers fathers army buddy when they kill a man inside their car jackson and travolta go to quinton tarantino who obviously feels a need for acting in his own movies who in turn calls a lets get to business type in harvey keitel keitel does a good job in this role as he does in every role he ever does the ending is very good also i give it an a+i love everything about this filmi love cinema i love mr. jackson i love extended dvds and i love new line. now that the trilogy is over i will at last be free to actively seek a girlfriend and rediscover the many faceted social life ive been patiently ignoring for the better part of this century...  thrilling spectacle is underd with palpable human drama and it finally becomes clear why j.r.r. tolkiens books continue to ring such bells so loudly in the lives of so many. i like this film there appear to be spelling mistakes in your review some suggestions have been made if you wish to

blaxploitation but he does it well  this is one glossy good looking smartly written b movie amanda plummer uma thurman and harvey keitel among others provide great support  only bruce willis as usual drops the proverbial ball but even hes not enough to sink this terrific picture okwell not so intelligent with all the unnecessary swearing and violence but it was a great film divided into very exciting segments which left you wondering what would happen next although some of the segments were led to the wrong direction which also make me think that the movie didnt make sense but you will get it the best part has to bewhen john travolta and samuel l jackson get those druggos in their apartment uma thurman was great in this film very fresh and alive well not really alive after that encounter with the needle the film was very bloody and had a lot of swearing but you didnt really focus on that when watching the film - it was that exciting well overall here are my ratings  i like the fantasy movie and specially like the lord of the rings. this movie in appear legolas  he is very handsome and quick in action he riding a shield shoot an arrow to monster  this is thrilling situation. and this movie appear gollum. hes a successful role hes a dual personality.. my precious~ my precious~ gollums line is very impressive. this appear movie in battlevariety magic monster etc.. and it was a very impression movie. also it was contained love story this movie is an exciting movie im recommend this movie :-di left the theater on december 16th without the words to describe what i have just seen. i still dont really. no other movie has done that to me since braveheart. no other movie has moved me to complete and utter shock then return of the king. shock that it was so good. shock that i actually wasnt disappointed for a movie ive been waiting for for years. shock that i actually cried to a movie picture. it took me a whole day to become un-overwhelmed and i just had to see it again. the second viewing solidified the movie as the greatest movie ever madeat least to me the scenery was beautiful. the acting was flawless. give sean astin and ian mckellen the oscar. now. sean astins samwise gamgee and ian mckellens gandalf will go down in movie history as two of the most beloved film characters. a few cuts from the book left me a bit disappointed but it didnt spoil the film on a whole for me one bit. they will be in the extended editions dvds so im not too worried about it. all and all the greatest movie ever made. bar none. move over godfather here comes return of the king.i knew it would be good but this takes the entire cake. peter jackson has absolutely outdone himself with this masterpiece. true there are a few tiny holes in the plot but they are easily overlooked. even if youre not a huge fan of tolkien you should really make an attempt to see this movie. i wasnt a fan of the books but jacksons movies have inspired me to pick them up and give them all a good read. cant wait for the dvd. lets see if jackson does as good a job with the hobbit.i knew about this movie for a long time. heck prison movies dont turn me on so i have very negative impression hence not watching it. i watched it today oct 2005 as it was on tv and i thought its got good rating so ill watch it least this way i wont be watching it alone. might as well get it over with. well any movie than can render a grown adult to tears and whirl up an emotional minefield has to be respected. this movie has my utmost respect. this is truly a great film even with all my negative baggage and seeing clips and reading people raving about it i still avoided it. to render a grown man to cry even with all the baggage has to be a really amazing film. this film transcends cinema to what its truly about - to move you. so technically its pointless you can go about actors direction shots music and so on and to analyse this film purely on that level would be one very stupid mistake. a mistake many have used while writing reviews. the book or film is simply a mechanism to get a message across it can be flawed and still work perfectly. thats not the point. the message here is clear and works perfectly on many unconscious levels it really would be stupid to try an figure it out. you cant as its so simple. we all have hope dreams and desires and want freedom and a better future. every person does. its actually why we exist. not to have hope dreams and desires and goals is truly not to live. not doing so there is no meaning to life. no matter what happens keep positive have hopes dreams and desires that is your purpose here on this planet this is what this film is about everything else is just mechanics to get this across are you positive do you have hopes do you have dreams do you have goals have you helped your fellow man just for the beauty and pleasure of making someone happy in a totally unselfish way without any personal gain if you havent and dont have hopes dreams desires and goals you are not alive you have no meaning to your life. in conclusion you can avoid this film as long as you want like i did but when it does catch up with you... you better be ready very ready. if you arent or dont understand what you are watching and what really is going on between the lines and mechanics of the imperfect mechanism of cinema you are dead truly dead and you might as well end it now. so my advise to you dont watch this film. if youve read this far and not got what ive been going on about you are a lost cause already and you might as well go into your miserable life and causing misery to yourself and others. heck itll take you several lifetimes probably to get it. so remember dont watch this film you dont deserve it.i just watched gone girl it seems talking about a possessive girl but when you look closer to the act you would observe her insecurity from loneliness and being stereotyped as a good girl as amazing amy as she has been forced to be someone she isnt she keeps her reputation by libeling men and tries to have more personal space by threatening them being polite kind and nice to people getting married having children and bringing up childrenthese all are the female figure in most countries she cant escape from the media because she is the girl in the novel so she chooses to have the freedom in this limitation she is a murder of her husbands freedom but she is also murdered by the stereotype of women in society i love the movie=] its a typical theme with a bloody rational expressioni just wanted to say that for a long time i thought it was just a crappy fiction movie but i was completely wrong. its the best movie ever made : the lord of the rings is a fairy-tale of myth and fantasy. peter jackson directed a film that was considered for a very long time impossible to make and not only for technical reasons. the narrative roots are incredibly long and detailed and the storyline is deeply connected with the creation of a fantastic continent from a time unknown called middle earth. its author tolkien dedicated a considerable part of his life developing this continents background its mythology and origins its different kinds of people cultures and languages and therefore its geographic references are determinant to the unfolding of the story of the one ring.i just want to say wow. the end of the journey comes in this movie as a brilliant ending. not only for the fantastic effects in this moviei just saw the dark knight and it was even better than i expected and i expected it to be great. most of this comment is about heath ledger so let me start by giving christian bale and the rest of the awesome cast directormake-upspecial effects team writers producers and so on a huge thank you for doing such an amazing job in and on this movie. now for ledger. people can say what they want about heath getting too much praise just because he is no longer with us cause it just isnt true. alive or gone this was the performance of a lifetime. the make-up the laugh the mannerisms every little thing he did was perfect. i have always had an image in my mind of how the joker was and this was finally it. i love jack nicholson because he is one of the best actors alive but i am sorry jack because heath ledger just out shined you and that is not easy to do. i was praying the entire movie that the joker would not be killed because it would have just been too symbolic and i would have lost it. i did cry at the end though. the ending when two face the commissioner and batman are talking about life and death and how unfair and too soon it can be it really struck home and paralleled heath ledgers untimely passing. it is completely unfair that heaths family and the world are going to miss out on such an amazing person with some of the rarest and rawest talent i have ever seen. i am a single mother and i cant even begin to imagine losing my daughter so my heart goes out to heaths family and his daughter. i am truly sorry that such an amazing man died so young. dahr princei just love the lord of the rings and this one is amazing. i recommend this movie to anyone and everyone it is adventurous heart-warming and a tear-jerker. it is definitely the best way to end the trilogy. i cried so much but it was wonderful and i will never forget it. i love anything that has to do with the lord of the rings and this movie completely changed my life. the lord of the rings is such a wonderful story full of love friendship action and hope. i am reading the books too and i think that all three of these movies follow the storyline very well. i just know that anyone who will watch these movies will love it. of course i recommend reading the books first  its just film. this is what movies are all about: great dialogues characters you can relate to although they are probably just as distant to your reality as e.g. the monsters in bad taste and appropriate music. its not a movie you can just turn on and watch unfocused though. if you really want to enjoy it youll probably have to see it three times or more. if youre not planning on doing this dont watch it then of course theres the mystery behind pulp fiction. whats in the briefcase although plausible theories have been developed well probably never know for sure. quoting the man himself tarantino on the question whats in the briefcase: anything you want.... to be brief: i really think this is the best movie ever made... i just have to say pulp fiction is one of the best movies i have ever seen. it is funny creative satirical and intelligenti just got back from a screening here in hungary and i am just not able to get the movie out of my head almost 3 hours but for me it felt like 3 minutes so captivating so real not gimmicky not cheesy well done america what really amazes me is that this movie was able to get my attention for almost 3 hours without any breakthrough and grand action maybe it did so because this movie was about real life life as it is grandmothers and mothers fathers and stepfathers sisters and friends young love and teenager life moving and fighting cheating and tears throughout the movie i had this diverse feelings inside me one of them is happiness and gladness because as the movie showed us life is beautiful life is extraordinary on the other side i felt depressed because as the movie showcased we are confused we dont know what and how to do we dont really know what life is and we expect so much more of it but i think the main message of the movie is at the ending that was perfect every moment seizes us this movie seized me astonishingi just finished watching the dark knight for probably the 10th time. watched it again right after watching batman begins. truly i just can not believe how close to perfect this movie is. it excites me so much that even after so many times i still find myself cheering crying and smiling during. to me this is a 10 out of 10. to me this is what a movie should be. to me this is the best movie of the decade by far if not even more. a few things i wish could be fixed to make it a truly perfect experience: 1. the dark knight is the last performance of heath ledger. i will never be able to see anything new from him again. heath to me is a god in this movie and i wish he was still around as honestly his performance is in the top 3 of all time movie performances in my book. 2. third movie is in the works i think.. i am sure i will be disappointed. i mean how can it get any better than this 3. did they have to crash the lamborghini murcielago every time i see that happen i go geez i am here hello just call me honestly the dark knight is not a movie - its an emotional experience that is rare i experience when looking at my screen. r.i.p heath ledgeri havent seen too many movies that i would rate a 10 but i had no problems giving this one top . movie-making seems to be like golfi havent read anything by tolkien. it is a great credit to these movies that you can watch all three without needing to have taken in the novels beforehand. this is an excellent end to an incredible trilogy. the plot is engaging from start to finish and this moves rather smoothly with great pacing. this is funny several times and there is very little of the annoyingand still easily ignored comic relief. i am thrilled to see gollum turn out to be such a richly detailed and thoroughly developed character. the meld of live-action and cgi elements is perfect. you forget that not everything youre seeing is really there. the effects are impeccable in general and the imaginative designs and boundless creativity are amazing. creepy and dark this isnt actually depressing in spite of many gloomy moments. the battle sequences are intense well-choreographed and awesome. this has astonishing editing and cinematography and has a marvelous look. the acting doesnt let you down at any point. there is a lot of scary and disturbing content in this and it might be too much for children. i recommend this to any fan of the fantasy genre and really everyone who enjoys an appreciation for the medium of film. 10/10i have written a few reviews on imdb and shawshank is one of my favorite movies of all time. i dont necessarily think this movie was a 10 but an easy 9 for me. i am giving it a 10 because of the negative reviews that i read with saying they gave this movie a 1 just because others had given it a 10. as far im concerned its mine to give if i want to to give every a movie a 10 which by the way i dont. i am just sick of people telling me that a movie cant be great because it was story driven and not character driven maybe i like story driven movies i certainly liked this one. so heres another 10 for you movie snobs will have to eradicate.  no matter what your struggles may be in life. this film is part of my childhood now in my adult hood and hopefully something dear i can share with my children and their children. until we all voyage into the west. i have watched it three times and enjoyed it more than the previous viewing this is simple a marvelous movie. the ending is just fine and dont understand why some people didnt appreciate it i think its needed. i rate this 10/10 the trilogy will definitely be at my favorite movie collection list.i have to say that i think people are being a bit harsh towards this movie i understand you are allowed youre own opinions but is it really that terrible that you feel the need to tell people not to watch it it really isnt a terrible movie theres action romance a great plot high quality special effects high quality acting by a great cast what more could you want? shailene does a wonderful job of portraying tris and how she has changed since the last film she clearly shows what is going on in her head the toll that losing her parents and killing one of her best friends is clearly shown by the way she acts she plays it spectacularly she makes the character feel real she makes it feel real and look real miles is hilarious he brings a comedy element to a film with quite tough themes and emotions in it theo does an amazing job of portraying a supportive yet tough four ansel portrays a weak cowardly caleb really well all of the acting is amazing i believe in many ways it stays true to the book it has the roughly the same basic plot with new added extras i believe that the way they changed it made it more interested as a film if they stuck with the original reason as to why jeanine was hunting divergents as a film i believe it would have been quite boring to see what they do in the film makes it interesting intriguing even i really do believe that people are saying too much harsh stuff about this movie it is interesting intriguing and has an amazing cast new and old the visual effects are amazing the acting is amazing it is worth a watch it doesnt matter if you watch it in 2d or 3d it is a good movie and i really enjoyed it fans will as welli have to be honest when i saw the trailer i thought the film would be very monotonous so i was wonder if i would watch the film eventually i am started to watch the movie right from the first minute i thought it was really a great movie not only because i am super interested in what plays in space and i love very much adventure films but also because its a bit the real life of an astronaut describes the say goodbye to your family for example and not being able to promise when you come back and if you come back at all also i found that the film contained a lot of variety and by that i mean that there is always a different kind of problem came or the planet was not viable or the spaceship went piece i thought it was really super that they have made almost 3 hours full of excitement at the last 50 minutes it was really kind of mind f*ck because i didnt know how it could be that he was in a 5 dimensional space but good in other words i found a super movie and i really hope there is a interstellar 2 comesi have to admit i did not see lotr until a year ago or so but after i watched it i will never see a movie the same again. peter jacksonwith this movie proves himself as one of the greatest director of all times.and the result of that is that this movie is awesoomeall the actors and actresses did a superbly good job also making the movie what it isok but who i think really kills it in this movies is andy serkis.andy serkis as gollum is the best casting choice ever he did such a good job at making every scene he is in count especially the end scene and if youve scene the movie you know what i mean.so the lord of the rings is great i think it more than deserved all the oscar wins it got and perfectly establishes itself as one of the greatest movies of all time.ill give it a perfect  10 out of 10.  and return of the king is the best of the bunch. sometimes you love a film because of the performances the cinematography the direction or writing and even the music. but sometimes its just simply how it makes you feel. in this case: speechless. the performances are note perfect  particularly sean astin andy serkis and sir ian mckellen. jacksons direction is outstanding keeping the audience utterly gripped moved and overwhelmed for three hours. the special effects have started to date in places yet this is a thats film over 10 years old. and given the speed in which technology and cgi progress these days it says a lot that for the most part it can still compete against modern cgi output. the film trilogy and return of the king in particular is a monumental achievement in film making never matched historically and unlikely to be bettered in the future. i have three framed posters of my favourite films on my wall. on the left is the dark knight and on the right is the lord of the rings: the return of the king. these are the best films of their outstanding trilogies and in my opinion are the greatest films of my generation. i have watched each countless times because theyre filled with action suspense and tension and also incorporate a sense of overcoming that which seems impossible to overcome. then purely because it was rated highly i watch a film not of my generation on a free dvd from the sunday times. without special effects or a large budget the shawshank redemption became my third poster because it exceeds the qualities tdk and rotk have in abundance. each are excellent. shawshanks better.i have this film on dvd and its one of my favourites. that said its been several years since i sat down and watched it and i hoped it was still as good as i remembered. it might be worth pointing out here that ive been a huge stephen king fan since i was at school probably a good 30 years all told. i have every book in general circulation and ive read a lot of them more than once. different seasons must have been one of the first books of his that i bought when it first came out way back in 82 or 83. its a collection of four unrelated novellas other than that each title has a different season mentioned in the subtitle. the first of the novellas is rita hayworth and shawshank redemption: hope springs eternal and it is in my opinion by far the best. if you havent read it i would thoroughly recommend it particularly if you havent seen the film as the movie stuck pretty closely to the original story so there wont be many surprises in store for you otherwise. incidentally if youve ever seen rob reiners movie stand by me or bryan singers apt pupil youll find two of the other stories in the collection pretty familiar too. but i digress back to the movie in question. i wasnt disappointed. this is undoubtedly a great movie and thoroughly deserves its place at the top of the list. the performances from tim robbins & morgan freeman are superb and the friendship between their characters develops over 20 years or so is entirely believable. you see them particularly freeman get gradually broken and institutionalised as the film plays out. and then of course you get that fantastic feel- good ending that you really wanted but somehow never actually expected. but its not just the performances from robbins and freeman that delight. both bob gunton the sadistic and greedy warden who somehow believes he is doing gods work and clancy brown remember him as the kurgan in highlander as the equally sadistic almost sociopathic captain hadley give wonderfully sinister performances. most of the other prisoners with the possible exception of james whitmores brooks are fairly two-dimensional but then the director almost seems to gloss over them deliberately to keep the viewers attention firmly directed towards the two leads and their developing bond. the film begins in the 1940s and continues on until the 1960s so it was essentially a period piece when it was made. this has stopped it becoming dated in any way. also because its set in a prison which appears almost completely isolated from the outside word the passage of time is easy to miss. the movie is as engrossing now as it was 15+ years ago when it was first released. at two and quarter hours its probably one of the longer films in the list although by no means the longest but it keeps the viewers attention for the full duration and never seems to lose its sense of direction. every scene pushes the plot forward in some way. a definite 10/10 from me and thoroughly recommended.i have seen this movie about 6 times and i get stunned every time. now has past one year since i last saw her so it got me thinkingi have seen this movie a few times. each time with the same hope and enthusiasm as before. the main story is obviously andys. his fears his hopes and dreams... his struggle to remain sane. as a rock hammer andy chisels the prison around him. but this is more than the story of andy and his way out of prison. its a tale of society men trying to survive trying to remain human and civilized. red is a gentleman masterfully played by on of the greatest actors ever. his character adds depth to the story and makes room for hope for friendship. all those around andy benefit from his morals his intelligence his perseverance his will not to let go of himself. at first we see men with no hope no way out of their walls. brooks is an unfortunate part of it. but andy changes lives. some study some begin to plan life outside the walls. even the guards look up to a man as righteous as they come. every time i see it i get the same warm feeling as the first time i saw it without actually knowing what it was what it is... its only fitting it sits on top of the charts and if that makes people watch it its just enough as it will bring them the same feeling again and again. i movie to watch once a year or whenever you need a little pick-me-up.i have seen the shawshank redemption twice now the second time being about a week ago. after the first time i saw it i gave it a perfect 10 rating on imdb something i do very rarely ive given out 20 ratings of 10 out of the 600+ movies ive rated. however after just one viewing i felt so impacted by this film that it immediately rocketed near the top of my favorite movie list. after a second viewing i feel even more amazed by it than i was the first time i saw it. the movie captures your interest in the first scene and unfolds new plot points and character developments slowly at first and then more rapidly as the movie goes on. the movie runs about 130 minutes long but it never gets boring. while it is admittedly slow paced this only serves into its greatness. it allows the viewer to get to know the characters of andy and red and sympathize with themi have seen the movie for the first time. its a wonderful film with excellent plot twists what gives a positive effect to the enjoying of the movie. things are happening you dont expect and thats good for a movie. its also a dark prison-film and i like that type of films. the voice of morgan freeman is also very nice and intimidating. the imdb-rating is very high. i think the movie deserves it but i understand other people who are thinking that this movie is overrated. i think the reason why is that this movie has less haters then other movies like pulp fiction and so on... . one point can be better: the characters doesnt become older when the movie progresses. but a well-deserved 10/10.i have seen the lord of the rings several times. which of the three is the best are the first two only because i know that there is still much to see. j. r. r. tolkien was a genius of literature. he had a magnificent imagination middle earth is an invention of genius where nothing was left to chance. to adapt to the movie is fantastic peter jackson did a great job where everything is perfect. to adapt to the movie is fantastic peter jackson did a great job where everything is perfect. the responsibility of peter jackson to make these movies was great he was to adapt a great work of fiction for the screen but did well.i have seen some movies in my life not much but some and most of them were good maybe there were a few i didnt like that much but interstellar man this movie is amazing wait not even amazing i cant find a word to describe how good it wasusually when i watch a movie i dont give it a rate just by i dont know just because of its story or special effects things like that but more on how i feel after watching iti have seen a few movies which people told me they are very good and they were also in the top but while watching them despite having a good story or something like that i had the feeling ohh god when it will end ? or meh its ok but not that amazing but while i was watching interstellar man i had that feeling that i really want to see whats going to happen that i wouldnt do anything else in that very moment and just wait to see what happens nextand there were moments that made me want to i dont know how to really say it participate in it for example i just felt the need to go and kill drmann for what he did and help cooper you know be a part of it of the moviethere were also some moments that really made me cry like when cooper saw his son and daughter after a lot of time or at the end when he saw his daughterin the end for me it was actually the best i have seen so far if only i could erase my memory of seeing it and watch it again i would watch it over and over again that good it wasi will personally give it a 10 out of 10 some might tell me that i am wrong but its my opinion and i really enjoyed itfor the others i really recommend watching it you wont regret it for surei have seen pulp fiction 67 times till now. and i simply enjoy every time and i m a big fan of quantine. i have seen all his directorial movie except 4 rooms.he is great & simply talented as a director & actor. i like many scenes of pulp fiction few of my best are when vincent inject it to understand were the extra money went...the plot when he first meet mia..the song u will be a women soon...and of course samuel ezeequi 25:17. butch killing zed 5 dollars shake bava choko madman comfortable silence fox force five gods miracle grand father watch foot massage magic marker martin & luise. apart from every thing i simply liked all the characters of the movie including tim rothmarcellaswolf & zed.i have seen many movies of rose and ben but this one will be added to my golden collections this is one kind where the story makes you fell what if a life saves turns out be a murderer and you cant find a way to get out of it slow thriller keeps once tight till the cast appears amazing screen play but still there were a bit of scope to be improved negligible flaws which are easily identifiable and they are illogical too a lot of good scenes will keep you enjoy watching the movie too many twist arent really made it bad many cases you will try to interrupt your own side of the story the moment you try to switch you will be brought back again to the same space where you were lost in one sentence after you watch this movie you will feel that you are saved but not safe with your loved one happy watching free advise do not watch it with your wife periodi have seen many movies in my time but it is ever so clear to me that this masterpiece deserves my final opinion. the lord of the rings: the return of the king is ground breaking to say the least and has been hailed as one of the greatest movies of all time and for great reason. it is movies like these that only come once in a great while and those who are there to enjoy the magic will not forget the impact that it brought to them. from the outstanding cast to the amazing visual effects to the beautiful musical  peter jackson has truly reminded us why we all watch movies in the first place. the return of the king has made its place in history as a landmark movie and for others it may have become something more.i have seen a lot of great films in my day and in my opinion this is one of if not the best film ever made. peter jackson does an amazing job as a director. he creates the siege of minas tirith perfectly. he uses the best effects that money can buy and they look fantastic. having nasgul fly down and rip a trebuchet off a massive wall is true cinematic art. on top of this there is an epic story that everyone can fallow. every time i view this movie i am amazed by what i see. i am entertained begging to end. this is by far the best film of the series which is also amazing to watch begging to end. 11 well deserved academy awards for lotr rtk including best picture and best director. if your a movie fan then watching the lord of the rings series is a must.i have not been an angelina jolie fan but she was superb in this movie i absolutely loved the movie i enjoyed it so much that ive seen it twice already and plan to purchase the movie as soon as it comes out on dvd the movie is a new take on the story of sleeping beauty and it is very well done the acting is good and angelina steals the show with her portrayal of maleficient if your looking for a movie that guys and girls with both love this it the special effects are breath taking and the writing is excellent i cannot say enough good things about this movie this is one of those movies that you will want to see again and againi have no doubts as to what the best movie of all time is: pulp fiction cool slick witty violent clever fun exciting cool cool and cool twenty years on quentin tarantinos pulp fiction has been rereleased in cinemas and it looks as mesmeric and mad as ever: callous insolent breathtaking the icy wit the connoisseur soundtrack the violence of which the n-bombs are a part the extended dialogue riffing the trance-like unreality the inspired karmic balance of the heroin scene and the adrenalin scene the narrative switchbacks that allow john travolta to finish the film both alive and dead the spectacle of him being made to dance badly but also sort of brilliantly _„_ above all else the sheer directionless excitement that only tarantino can conjure in 1994 it broke over my head like a thunderclap and in 1990s britain this touchstone of cool seemed to extend its dangerous influence everywhere: movies fiction journalism media fashion restaurants you name it everyone was trying to do irony and incorrectness but without his brilliance it just looked smug the americans get tarantinoi have never seen such an amazing film since i saw the shawshank redemption. shawshank encompasses friendships hardships hopes and dreams. and what is so great about the movie is that it moves you it gives you hope. even though the circumstances between the characters and the viewers are quite different you dont feel that far removed from what the characters are going through. it is a simple film yet it has an everlasting message. frank darabont didnt need to put any kind of outlandish special effects to get us to love this film the narration and the acting does that for him. why this movie didnt win all seven oscars is beyond me but dont let that sway you to not see this film let its ranking on the imdbs top 250 list sway you let your friends recommendation about the movie sway you. set aside a little over two hours tonight and rent this movie. you will finally understand what everyone is talking about and you will understand why this is my all time favorite movie.i have never seen a perfect movie and did not know there could be such a thing. but this is it. i have always been a batman fan. but this was so much more than a comic book movie. it was an epic. even if had nothing to do with the character we know and love it would still have an excellent story. its suspenseful funny terrifying heartwarming. it literally has everything you could want from a movie. and it seems real. the batmobile didnt look like a bat it looked like a tank able to withstand anything. plus it held the batpod. how awesome was that and the joker heath ledger may he rest in peace did absolutely some of the best acting i have ever ever seen. he was the joker. not some cheesy bad guy. he was a real psychopath. he was both hilarious and terrifying. and his objective was to cause chaos. not greed. just to wreak havoc on gotham city and especially on batman. and the whole story is phenomenal. its over two and a half hours long yet it doesnt seem like it at all. you never want it to end. it starts with a bang and never slows down. and the armored car chase easily the best car chase ever put on film. i watched this movie three times in the theater. ive never done that. and i love movies. great story great real effects the only cgi in the entire movie was two-face and im glad christopher nolan did that right and not like tommy lee jones and the acting - top notch across the board. i cant wait to see how how nolan tops this because you know he will this. i cant believe it didnt even get a nod for best picture. a shame. at least ledger won. he deserved every bit of the hype. he and nolan both went above and beyond all expectations.i have never liked batman as a character... old movies were ok but not that good... until christian bale came... this movie is the reason why batman is one of my favorite characters ever... the plot the direction the acting... heath ledger rip is amazing... an excellent movie indeed the movies that follow are better and better...the way the movie trilogy shows the development of characters is amazing... i was astonished when at the end of the dark knight rises how robin is born... who is catwoman two-faces and others... i am planning to watch gotham - the series now because of this movie... thank you everyone for making batman the coolest character everi have never grinned for the entire length of a movie before i watched guardians ok i admit it im a huge comic book fan and i believe i spotted many of the referenced in the first viewing however this film is pure joy it is joyful because it is part of the marvel universe? hell yeah it is joyful because it deserves to be part of the marvel universe and it respect the marvel universe and its source material can people that are unfamiliar with the marvel universe enjoy this film? i presume so however the more important question is how can anyone not be familiar with the marvel universe give the parade of pureawesome films that marvel has created since iron man? if you want to see a film go and watch this one its pure fun and it deserves to be enjoyedi have never been a fan of fantasy nor have i read the lord of the rings novel when virtually everyone did in high school. i knew many people loved the book to the extreme but i never gave it a second thought. however the films that were translated from tolkien were magnificent in particular this concluding one this trilogy is about as perfect as we can ever expect from movie-making and i was even sad to see it end. wouldnt it be great to see movies like this come out every year weve certainly been spoiled by this one thats for sure i relished in the action adventure romance and mythology of this series. the music cinematography characters and scope make this trilogy one for the ages. even if you are not a fan of fantasy like me do yourself a favor and go on the rings journeyi have never been a fan of comic book superheroes but this one was amazing. it blew me away when i watched it for the first time. christopher nolan has created another master piece. nolan showed what i was looking for in a super hero moviei have lost count of the amount of time i have watched this film. i enjoy watching all of quentin tarantinos films but this has to be one of my favourite. there is plenty of action and bad language they just dont make films like this anymore. tarantinos films have garnered both critical and commercial success. he has received many industry awards including two academy awards two golden globe awards two bafta awards and the palme dor and has been nominated for an emmy and a grammy. he was named one of the 100 most influential people in the world by time in 2005[4] and filmmaker and historian peter bogdanovich has called him the single most influential director of his generationi have just returned from a premiere in newcastle australia15/7/08 let me just say this has to be one of the best movies of 2008. every performance in this movie is just fantastic and heath ledger owns the joker i dont think anyone could match his style and he eats up every scene he is in. this has to be scene on the big screen to be enjoyed this is one of the very few sequels that is better than the original. make 2008 the year to see and enjoy one of the years best. and i hope in feb 09 heath is nominated for an oscar he will always be remembered cheersi have just finished watching boyhood and i can just simply say that it is one the greatest films i have seen in a long time the cast who portray the characters are excellent and play there roles superbly one character i was drawn to from the out skirts and through out was mason mason is a very relate able character in my opinion especially if you are a boy of that age and have experienced the things mason did throughout the film it wasnt just the cast i enjoyed however the story it self was pure film brilliance the fact that it took the majority of 12 years to record makes this film an extra bit special the best part about this film for me is how the film highlights the key landmarks and events of a parents and childs life span together as a family i would defiantly recommend this film to anyonei have grown up watching bollywood movies full of overacting by overpaid overfed heroes. it was in college that i got to see some fine hollywood films and this one was probably the finest of the lot. this film at first appears to be a story about life in prison. it fully describes every small experience of a person serving a long prison sentence. life is not easy there for a lot of reasons. the screenplay is ably supported by morgan freemans brilliant narration offering a second-person view of life in shawshank. but tim robbins steals the show by aptly underplaying the part of a wrongly sentenced wealthy banker.the last forty minutes of this film however help raise it a couple of levels above other cinematic masterpieces. you dont need a weapon to fight. it is easy to take away a mans bread even his freedom but impossible to take away his hope.i have been into movies since well i was 5. but after about 15 years i finally was lucky enough to come across this title. i had a huge expectation when i started watching it.hey it aint number 1 for show that much i can vouch for. well it took me a few minutes to get into it but well once i got engulfed it was just sheer pleasure and goosebumps. the film revolves around the inmates of a prison and a new fish accused of homicide joining the faculty.the film depicts how he changed their lives and helped them to realize and bring back the greatest gift of life taken away from them . the friendship the hardship the simplest joy the tragedies  the yearning for freedom in each breath has been brilliantly acted and directed.the movie makes you feel good.after watching it it makes you smile and strengthens your faith in humanity.i am no critic but this movie made me happy ecstatic and i would love to re-watch it again and again. so i would say go on watch it at once if you have not. you will love it no matter what your taste in films are. because this film expresses humanity in each way possible. and as a fellow human being you will love the emotions. if you dont then well i will be a bit surprised. p.s 1994 was the year of forrest gump. it took home all the awards. though it is a great film but in my opinion it remains only great while shawshank is one of the greatest if not the greatest movie of all times. thank you...  gimli a dwarf warrior  legolas an elven prince  and gandalf a wizard. the work was initially intended by tolkien to be one volume of a two- volume set the other to be the silmarillion but this idea was dismissed by his publisher.for economic reasons the lord of the rings was published in three volumes over the course of a year from 29 july 1954 to 20 october 1955 thus creating the lord of the rings trilogy. the three volumes were entitled the fellowship of the ring the two towers and the return of the king. structurally the novel is divided internally into six books two per volume with several appendices of background material included at the end of the third volume. some editions combine the entire work into a single volume. the lord of the rings has since been reprinted numerous times and translated into many languages. tolkiens work has been the subject of extensive analysis of its themes and origins. although a major work in itself the story was only the last movement of a larger epic tolkien had worked on since 1917 in a process he described as mythic. influences on this earlier work and on the story of the lord of the rings include philology mythology religion and the authors distaste for the effects of industrialization as well as earlier fantasy works and tolkiens experiences in world war i. the lord of the rings in its turn is considered to have had a great effect on modern fantasy  the impact of tolkiens works is such that the use of the words tolkienian and tolkienesque have been recorded in the oxford english dictionary. the enduring popularity of the lord of the rings has led to numerous references in popular culture the founding of many societies by fans of tolkiens worksand the publication of many books about tolkien and his works. the lord of the rings has inspired and continues to inspire artwork music films and television video games and subsequent literature. award-winning adaptations of the lord of the rings have been made for radio theater and film. i have been a cinema lover for years read a lot of reviews on imdb and everywhere and never found the right movie to write my first review i always thought i would wait for the movie and this is it when i first heard that nolan was preparing a scifi movie i felt like a kid again waiting for his christmas gift under the tree i knew it would become a classic and im sure it will first of all it is incredibly beautiful to watch honestly it was so beautiful that i felt like i was sucked into the movie the way nolan decided to show some scenes really remind me of 2001 a space odyssey actually many things will probably remind you of this movie we can feel the talent of christopher nolan just by looking at the way it is filmed the techniques he used contribute to create that visual environment in a believable way the sound environment is just mesmerizing it is a very important part of the movie because some scenes take place in space and noland just found the right way to use sound the soundtrack made by the great hans zimmer is breathtaking epic amazing unreal i could find a lot more adjectives to qualify it but you have to hear it to understand how epic they are these two important parts image and sound create a stunning atmosphere you will forget you are in a movie theater and you will be lost in space sucked into the adventures of this new space odyssey begging for more it is a truly unique experience i can say that i have never felt something like that in a movie theater at least not for the past ten years then of course the cast first of all matthew mcconaughey i discovered this actor in tropic thunder but he didnt really convince me though he was quite funny then i saw dallas buyers club since that movie i love him in this movie well he is the movie i exaggerate a bit since there are other great actors some even unexpected with a special guest who play extremely well but he is just what was needed to feel the human part of the story which is very important in interstellar he is capable of making us feel so many different emotions all along the story as a father as a human anne hathaway was very convincing all together the actors managed to create some harmony which makes the human interactions credible caine chastaing and affleck are a perfect choice and then there is the special guest i will call him x his role which could be seen as a minor role is actually much more important than that he proves once again that he is a great actor watch and see and finally the scenariostory i wont spoil anything here ill just try to convince you how great it is nolan is known to revolutionize everything when he tries a new genre in cinema well once again he did it with the dark knight he revolutionized the superhero genre with interstellar hes revolutionizing the scifi genre in cinema from what i heard he worked with a physicist in gravitational physics and astrophysics to help him with that movie and we can feel and see it during the fifties asimov laid the foundations of modern science fiction lucas and kubrick did the same in cinema today nolan is laying the new foundations of the genre in cinema proving that cinema is still at the beginning of what can be done brace yourselves my friends we have not seen anything yet why? well simply because we only know a few things about space some things cant be proved for the moment so we can use theory and make the best of it that is exactly what nolan did he used theories that exist today and made a movie about mankind about pioneers about humanity about us because in spite of all the scifi aspect it is a story about humanity mcconaughey hathaway and mainly x will managed to convince you about that my rating for this movie can only be a 10 because in itself it is a beginning for a new kind of cinema it is a classic those who say we cant compare this movie to 2001 space odyssey nor can we compare nolan to kubrick are wrong we can and we should talented people dont live only in the past some genius live today among us and nolan is one of them many say that he is overrated i truly dont think so only time will answer that this is the scifi movie of the decade and probably the best movie nolan ever made just go for it without a second thoughti hadnt seen any tarantino movie before pulp fiction but this one totally blew me away a truly unique style of film making coupled with some brilliant performances whats most remarkable is that all the parts fit together so well you almost get a feeling of eureka plus the music of pulp fiction is its biggest strength going so well with whats playing on screen its almost as if youre witnessing the scene in first person theres great chemistry between the lead actorstravolta and jackson excellent camera-work and a lot of minor details that caught my attention only in a second viewingthe banter between the characters feels so real at times you forget youre watching a movie pulp fiction is not just a film its an experience  a lesson in the art of film making tarantino captures every emotion of his characters so well you develop a closeness with them and of course a liking for them in the end its about projecting the realities of life in a fashionable relatable way and this tarantino does with grace and control i had the honor of watching tdk during a screening and was completely blown away this isnt just the best batman movie ever made this is one of the best movie ever made. everything in this film is excellent not one piece of annoyance. bale marvels as bruce wayne/batman ledger has made the joker in to an iconic movie villain. his performance belongs there at the top with hopkins lecter. the joker has finally been portrait properly on film he has earned his place between the big boys in movie villandom. this is the true joker every batman fan knows loves and fears. ledger deserves any and every movie award known to man for this brilliant display. nolan has made his i will always be remembered movie this is the crownjewel in his portfolio. perfect directing perfect story perfect balance between action and drama everything is perfect. even if you hate batman you will love this film. if you dont then something beez wrongz with youzi had the fortune of seeing this at a drive in movie theater. unfortunately i was also shooting a commercial for that drive in but i did most of my shooting before the movie even started. it was a great experience. i did however go to see it again in a proper theater environment. my cars speakers just werent up to task. i understand not everyone will get it either the story or christian bales voice or all the unbelievable action sequences and chain of events. i think they forget that ultimately this is a movie based on comic book characters. everything about it is fantastical. this movie is amazing on every level. great writing the performances are all convincing the effects realistic and the parallels to events in our own world jarring. the cinematography is beautiful and the moral dilemmas the personal struggles all relate to the events occurring in the film. there are some who fail to understand the symbolism of batman and what it means to bruce wayne. why they ask would bruce wayne in this film want to lay down the cowl for good think about peace within yourself and what it means for those around you. how it affects the world around you. therein lies the answer. simple enough. there are lots of things to appreciate about this movie - at the very least just enjoy the exhilarating action scenes and suspense.i had read all the tolkien books long before this beautifully done set of films were made. i did not see the first two films in the theater as i am not much of a movie goer. i did see them on dvd and liked them very much. the sound quality in the first two was my only complaint i found it difficult to hear what the actors were saying at times but in this final film that seemed much improved. of course this final part of the tale is less dialog and more action so that may explain the improved effect it may also be because i saw this in the theater and the sound is better quality than my little tv gives. i was enchanted with the whole finale of the tale. i was glad that the ending was not changed to much though i liked the struggle to save the shire at the end of the book the movie was getting long and the tale stood without that piece. i hope we can look forward to the hobbit some day by this same group of people it will make my dvd collection complete. i hope many people will read these books now because creativity and imagination need to be developed on well written works like this. i am sure mr. tolkien would have been pleased.i had not heard about gone girl before september 2014 i discovered it when i decided to check david finchers filmography one day a new fincher movie? awesome were the thoughts that flew through me unfortunately i didnt get to see it in theatres but i did get to see it after a while the story is dark and superbly crafted it is rare to find a story with such a simple premise yet such a complex execution youll second guess yourself every scene to what is going on yet you will always be wrong the acting is also really great with affleck and pike giving truly great performances and yes i had no problem with tyler perry the  by trent reznor & atticus ross was great as always and of course the direction by david fincher is superb it is rare to find a director as great as him working today overall this movie is great and should not be missed but be warned this movie is quite disturbingi had heard a lot about this movie being a classic and a must-see and normally that negatively impacts my view of a movie because unrealistic expectation often ruins the true quality of a movie. this movie however managed to surpass all my expectations. i didnt know much concerning the story except that it was a movie set in a prison but its so much more than that. the major theme that became apparent to me throughout this movie was how we regard as good and evil is largely dependent on the storyteller and how he chooses to paint the heroes/villains. convicted felons are not usually considered heroes or people that you root for and want to succeed but the story is about so much more than that. the shawshank redemption is about hope and more importantly the struggle to maintain it when the world is doing its best to crush it. tim robbins and morgan freemans on-screen chemistry is amazing. there are no weak scenes no wasted dialogue. they are the best things about the movie they make you believe they make you hope.i had been looking forward to this movie since i heard it was being made the cast was superb the director needed no introduction and the subject matter fascinating when i finally saw this film i was blown away i absolutely loved every second of it i am not one for going to a movie and scrutinising every frame when i go to the cinema i buy nachos and a coke and i enjoy getting involved in the story as long as it is good of course and this movie was so much more than good interstellar was one of these times where i got totally taken in by the story i had forgotten i was in the cinema and nolan had put me in the movie along with the brilliant mcconaughey the way nolan takes you through this film is truly enjoyable one that requires your full attention and theres no problem there as interstellar grabbed mine from start to finish great moviei grew up watching the cartoon version of cinderella so when disney released the reallife version i eagerly went to watch it it was an absolutely fantastic movie from beginning to end the short frozen scene at the beginning was a really nice touch actually i walked into the cinema with average expectations but was stunned by just how good it was lets start with the cast lily james is absolutely perfect for the role of cinderella her portrayal of innocence and kindness was fantastic she looked amazing and pulled off the role perfectly cate blanchett was perfect for the role of the evil stepmother i could actually feel her hatred towards cinderella throughout the movie richard madden as the prince was also brilliant because his romance with ella felt real and not forcedmany a time ive seen a movie where the lead relationship looks forced finally the cgi was spot on it made the movie feel magical and it also gave the movie a nice touch so in conclusion i recommend everyone to watch this movie because we all need a little magic in lifei got to see the dark knight on wednesday night the reason though why im writing this movie comment this late is because i didnt wanna just jump and say this movie was awesome i wanted to think it through still today i cant stop thinking about this movie the dark knight lives up to its hype and goes beyond it this is the batman movie that goes where no other batman movie has gone before. it gave us a real sold story we are finally told why the villains are the way they are how all the injustice in the world can get underneath batmans skin how you have to believe that people still have faith in good on earth. heath ledger i absolutely loved jack nicolsons performance in the 1989 film when i first read that heath was signed onto the dark knight i was like what are they kidding once you see the dark knight... heath was incredible im not going to compare jack and heaths performance because they were two different versions of the joker but heaths joker was definitely the more scary and intense of the two nominations. you didnt know what he was going to do next he was so crazy he was also so charismatic to the point where you could relate to his character and the worst part is not only that hes crazy hes driving gotham crazy and treating everyone like little puppets on strings that he can control and guess what he is doing it so well with a smile on his face. this was so much more than a batman film this was so much more than a comic book film the dark knight truly delivers with drama action romance horror dark humor the study of a psychopathic killer a detective story. the force behind this epic movie is christopher nolan whos previous film batman begins didnt really thrill me but his incredible film making is truly shown in the dark knight the shots that he got of gotham city were absolutely fantastic and made you feel part of the city part of the batman story. one of the things that i absolutely loved about the dark knight is that normally with a comic book movie you know its not real people dont dress up in costumes and save the day villains dont name themselves crazy names and dress in make up or crazy costumes but the dark knight actually makes it seem incredibly real like it could happen. bruce wayne is still learning how to be in his double life of batman and himself he has lost rachel to the new district attorney harvey dent hes inspiring others who are dressing up as batman and are trying to take on the villains of the city themselves. but things are much worse when the joker waltzes into town and hes going to bring hell upon gotham city. constantly playing with gothams mind and trying to get batman to reveal himself batman has never dealt with such a psychopathic genius before. the joker has named himself as the classy villain that gotham needs he also has brought a new thought into batmans head of them actually being more alike than different that batman completes him the joker would be nothing without him. but batman is relying on harvey dent who is gothams white knight trying to put all of gothams scum in jail. but when the joker plays batman and commissioner gordon harvey and rachel find themselves in very horrific position and harvey must discover if he will die a hero or live long enough to become a villain. all the performances are dead on in this movie now everyones going crazy over heath ledgers performance but one performance i would also love to credit is aaron eckhart who plays harvey dent/two face his performance was just as great as heaths and made two face a human villain. you could understand his hatred and vengeance on what happened to him and why he became two face. i know that everyone is saying this but i truly mean when i say this is one of the best movies i have seen in a very long time. we had some great movies these past few years but i think the dark knight is seriously something special but i dont wanna build it up too much since some people go to the theater expecting my words to be the same as your own. in my opinion though this is not a great movie i cant come up with a word describe how incredibly powerful this movie was to be honest i would go above a 10 rating if i couldi first watched the lotr trilogy when i was 13 y/o. it was my fathers favorite movie. back then i was not able to understood fully what it is all about but i liked it. i did not love it like i loved harry potter back then but i liked it. entering high school i have gotten the chance to re-watch the whole trilogy again and again and again and this time i absolutely loved it. i became obsessed with the story. tolkien created a beautiful world and wrote about this amazing characters. we see each of the characters growth as we followed their journey up to the end. the cinematography of all movies are spot on. the sound was done beautifully and the actors gave life to one of the most-loved characters of all time. the return of the king concludes the story of middle-earth having peace back in their world. we know that cgi can both be the angel and the demon at the same time but with this film it was done just right. this truly elevated my standard with films. the quality was spectacular and truly a timeless piece.  a good director a thrilling history that you want to involve in yourself good directed action scenes romantic histories that has its turning points in the main story a good cast and good assistants. and its a great video version based on a great book. and that arent always so easy to manage especially not when the book its based on is so full of action and details so thumbs up for peter jackson and his crew = the actors are a chapter for itself who keeps the story so living thrilling and amazing the whole movie. they does an amazing job and i thinks nobody can deny that. the people that got the job for the costumes also did an incredible job dressing the actors so they looked like elves men dwarfs orcs moria goblins hobbits and other fantasy creatures + those who computer animated all of the trolls ents servants of the dark master the dark master himself the flame deamon from the old ages and all of that stuff. im feeling that ive said my opinion about this subject if eleven oscars has not i first saw this film like many others by chance and on dvd. and like others i have since watched it over and over again. when i feel sad it makes me feel happy when i need hope it gives me hope.when i want to reaffirm my very belief in life and all it can offer this film gives me a new sense of purpose that no other film has ever come close to doing.it soars above anything any other movie has tried to achieve in the way it touches on the true virtues of life itself. the portrayal of friendship the devastation of loss and the maintaining of hope. outstanding performances from the two leads and the most beautiful of narratives are the tip of the iceberg of why this film is so great. the cinematography from the very first shots of the prison are stunning and the accompanying soundtrack add to the haunting atmosphere when we first venture inside the prison walls. thank you mr darabont mr robins and mr freeman. thank you to every one else involved. you changed my lifei first heard of interstellar in october 2013 and managed to avoid all information about this film until seeing this watching the teaser trailer released in november 2013 just moments before heading to the imax to get an idea of the story what i was not prepared for was the scale of the film and the story this film is really a must see and only when you see it will you understand that statement a lot of the complaints with this film has been with the plot and not understanding the science behind it the science behind it was easy for me to understand considering i have an a levels in physics but all the concepts you need to understand and know in order to follow story is all there and is repeatedly gone over throughout the film in one form or another the last third of the film made use of these concepts to provide a very unique take on the corner of physics this movie is situated in in the process it offered an exhilarating twist for scifi fans who managed to follow the physics the heart of the film really lies in the  and acting though sensational work all around the board and matthew mcconoughay delivers some truly outstanding moments of raw emotion throughout the film ive choose to give little away in this review but if you havent seen the film and are worried that the science may trouble you fear not  searching on youtube for a quick beginners guide to general relativity in relation to time and gravity should give you everything you need to know for the concepts which make up this film again i got that interstellar would be using these concepts from the teaser trailer so it really isnt a spoiler to say you may want to fill yourself in on that if you feel you may need to my brother has not sat a levels yet and his experience to this film was different from mine as he struggled to keep with the concepts this film has made so vital to its story this seems to be a common complaint for everyone who did not like this movie  but after explaining the physics to him he re saw the movie and his feelings changed to fall in line with mine i walked out of this film feeling like this was the best experience of my life at the cinema but i have waited over a month to share my review to see if that statement holds true and if my feelings toward the movie has dulled i am pleased to say it has not  even with the release of fury which i have seen after watching interstellar and also lovedi find something new to like about pulp fiction every time i see it. shocking intelligent exciting hilarious and oddly though-provoking. best bit: jacksons bible quote harvey keitel the gimp or is it the watch dream two hours of highlights.i entitle my review a new hope as i walk out of the cinema feeling like i have just watched the star wars of our generation as a huge marvel fan both comics and film i was delighted to hear this film was getting made with the perfect choice of guardians and what a perfect cast to play them the biggest surprise for me was dave bautista who i thought was only cast for his size but his delivery was spot on for drax chris pratt was hilarious whilst still excellent at delivering some of the films most emotional scenes cgi in this film was super theres nothing i hate more than too much cgi in a film but it was so good in guardians that i was completely lost in it never have a seen space look so good the battles were incredible and groot and rocket never looked out of place aside from being a tree and raccoon gunn is the perfect director for this his tone his balance of comedy action and emotion blended perfectly and directing gotg would have been no easy job dc are still trying hard to get justice league going marvel just made a film with a talking tree and raccoon and it was awesome not a bad performance all round and comic fans will be happy with certain nods and winks scattered throughout probably my top marvel film yet it has the fresh new feeling the first iron man had with all the action and humour of the avengers 10 stars from me even if your not a comic book or scifi fan this movie has something for everyonei ended up watching the film this year and its now one of my favorites of all time. john travolta and samuel l jackson play their characters phenomenally and they work really well together. also theres so many memorable lines in the film. director quentin tarantino adds to the list of great movies by executing another spectacular film. this movie is a real one of a kind type of film well i believe at least. uma thurman does a stunning job she brought an entire new aspect to her character her character seems very independent and is quite likable. i have personally recommended this film to a variety of different people and i believe it can be enjoyed by film lovers of any genre.  pulp fiction. its pertaining to old comic book strips usually containing lurid subject matter with a modern day twist. the film conveys this perfectly through the eyes of characters: vince jules and butch played by travolta jackson and willis. the non-linear time sequence also allows the audience to become more submerged in the multilateral plot by understanding how each characters actions eventually effect anthers causing the plot to intertwine narratives. the cool 1950s - 1970s rock n roll music also saturates the film in a cool and eccentric atmosphere which is then juxtaposed with gratuitous violence sexual violence and drug themes. this feeling is perfectly described by one scene of travoltas character vincent driving a cherry red convertible cadillac down a road at high speed with mia wallace uma thurman overdosing on heroin in the back seat. this is how the film makes you feel when it reaches its climax. on the other hand the relief comes with witty dialogue and great humour which makes you think about pop culture and society. the whole film is an absolute ride and my favourite of all time. i dont usually write reviews but this movie blew me away it was amazing in so many ways the animation for one was beautiful and intense watching maleficent fly was emotional and inspiring i couldnt help but think how amazing this movie must have been in the theater this movie was humorous in its own special way maleficents personality was both emotional and hilarious at times i found myself laughing a lot and really feeling all of her emotions throughout the movie this is a great movie for everyone i cant say enough how well done this movie was it had every element i enjoy and the characterscharacter growth was well done this movie kept me anticipating what was to come next the entire timei dont think ive ever seen a finer super hero movie in quite some time. this has everything in it. action suspense thrills. anything you want in a action film its here. the reason why this movie stands out among the rest is because not only was nolan making a super hero movie he was trying to make a regular movie. theres also the astounding performance by heath ledger as the joker. its the down right best portrayal of the joker at least live action wise mark hammills voice acting is quite amazing as well. this honestly is the best action and super hero movie made in quite some time and i just hope that more super hero movies take this as a starting point and try to make them at least this good.i dont know why this movie is getting so many hateful reviews i thought the direction was awesome the acting was awesome and the story was awesome the movie was a great adaptation of the human relationship condition and its effects on us from beginning to end i was glued to the movie entranced by the events and the music ben afflecks performance was very impressive and it has made me even more excited about his upcoming role of batman in superman vs batman i think its best to watch this movie without knowing anything about the plot thats how i did when i told someone about the movie they said oh you mean the one with the kidnapped chick i stopped wasting my time telling them anything because if someone told me that before i watched i would have had a completely different perspective of the moviei dont have enough space here to point out all of the misconceptions about pulp fiction so ill just give everybody my take on the film and its message pulp fiction is a truly brilliant film that few people will ever completely understand pulp fiction covers everything from social satire to morality to just good old fashion movie fun first of all i would like to explain the bible verse that jules reads ezekeil 25:17 and how it applies to the story jules is the righteous man vincent is the selfish and marsellus represents the tyranny of evil men jules is beset on all sides by this negativity and must find it in himself to overcome it jules in the end finds redemption where vince and marsellus have the vengance of the lord layed upon them for their sins this is just one layer of a great story perhaps thats the brilliance of pulp fiction: the various layers that the film can be enjoyed on pulp fiction is the citizen kane of the 90sit has changed filmaking like few others the acting in pulp fiction makes it seem like the actors were just born to play their roles in the movie uma thurman and samuel l jackson give a couple of the finest performances in screen history the social satire and quentins great direction only fuel the fire its just too bad that the subject matter of the film turn people away from pulp fiction because those people are really restricting themselves pulp fiction is my all-tie favorite film and i believe that in 10 or 15 years it will go down as the greatest film ever made 10 out of 10i dont easily remember the names of actors of hollywood movies neither do i ever take the time off writing comments on any movie but for this movie i have to do it all. the whole way of presenting this movie has been outstanding i.e. from the beginning to the end. great performances tim robbins & freeman qualifying as one my favorite actors. the whole presentation has been very apt to the movie. but what is important is the strong message this movie transcends i.e. of hope is truly recommendable. this movie deserves an intent watch by all. do take you some time off to watch the movieif not twice be it once.i dont come here that much i write even less reviews but this movie its incredible the script characters story effects i was forced to come here and compliment everyone involved in it it will be hard to come back to the cinema to see any other hero movie pros everything it was so funny throughout the movie filled up with action incredible scenes i even think that the effects surpass dawn of the apesi mean i now love that raccoon more than batman cons i think that the action  close combat scenes could have been better they werent bad but i didnt see gamora as deadly as she should have been besides this its a flawless movie thats the reason for the 10 its difficult to do something just this perfect to close it up thanks to everyone involved in doing this masterpiecei dont care if there are some poor souls who would like to belittle this film. just think of these misfits as beyond redemption. i saw this film in 1995 and still vividly felt the euphoria of the final half hour which stayed with me for a couple of weeks. i was convinced this was the best film i had ever seen in my life even better than akira kurosawas ran and one flew over the cuckoos nest which was my all time favorite until tsr came along. i excitedly contacted my best friend who shared the same passion and he confirmed my thoughtsthis must be the best film ive ever seen but it is sad though that i will probably never see a better film for the rest of my life as i have seen the best. in music i have heard the best in rush and jackson browne which made others pale in comparison and in movies i have tsr. hail frank darabonti do not know how many times i thought this film was finished and it was not - although it took a while to get into it the ending was so exceptional i`ve watched it time and time again. there were so many twists i was not expecting - the author should be applaudedi do not even feel as though i need to go into a great amount of detail to explain just how amazing this film is. youve probably seen the movie sitting on the top spot of imdbs top 250 or maybe youve heard a friend babble on about how great the movie is and know it must be half-decent. i can assure you this will live up to your expectations. the acting the plot the setting the cast the directing the messages and symbols the acting again deserves another mention is just about as perfect as a movie can be in this setting. please dont waste your time pondering over whether or not to see this movie or whether or not you should believe the hype because i can assure you you can. go buy this from your local movie store or buy it online - i really dont care - just make sure you watch this film before anything else. as an 18-year-old guy i can say with confidence this is the best movie i have ever seen - or ever will see. go watch it nowi didnt think tarantino could possibly top reservoir dogs but here he is only two years later outdoing himself with pulp fiction a bigger budget than reservoir but still small by hollywood standards the film is a masterpiece winning tarantino the oscar for original screenplay and getting well deserved nominations for best picture director actor travolta supp actor jackson and supp actress thurman my one complaint is that many people who rent the video are missing out on some of the joys of the film because most of the videos are cropped so that you cant see the whole screen the way you did in the theatre for example when drug dealer eric stoltz is in bed watching tv before travolta calls him letting him know he and uma are on their way over you see a box of funny looking breakfast cereal some outdated brand that stoltz is eating in the video you cant see it and you miss out on one of the funny sight gags tarantino has in store for you its little details like these that help make pulp fiction a treasure to view long after the initial impact of the stories wears off the films style has been ripped off but only the coen bros fargo has come close to bringing us the same off beat pleasures as the years go on movie fans will be more and more surprised to learn pulp fiction did not win for best picturei didnt see the film in the cinema because i was too young at 14 though when i did rent it on video and subsequently dvd it was and is still to this day the best movie i have ever hired out and now i have the dvd with all the extras it makes a truly memorable film that much complete. its true what they say about this having an impact on peoples lives as it did me. from the moment it starts and you start to hear the narration of morgan freeman you know there is something special to this film. the films message of hope even in the most dark situations hope can be our salvation and it is so true. the film is put together perfectly what brings the film together for me is morgan freemans voice its so powerful in his acting on screen in the film as well as his narration. there are two best scenes for me most powerful is reds 3rd parole hearing it sums up total acceptance of what hes done and he can be open to them about how he truly feels without a care or worry in the world. the second is when red finds the box under the oak tree and the whole story seems to come together at that point. the way time progresses is an essential aspect in this film and thats another excellent example you see of andy and the warden almost becoming partners in crime and they develop this close bond. prison drama no that description doesnt give this film justice its a pure masterpiece and if you havent seen it i would advise buy a copy now you wont be disappointed. even after 50 or so viewings i still get a lump in throat.i didnt see anything so blood and cruel to laugh well there are four stories in this film related by common characters but what are these stories and these characters they are unbeleivable and realistic in the same time the film is not like ordinary action or ordinary comedy there is something new that tarantino brought to cinematograph if you dont afraid of blood brutality drugs homosexualists hitters frehcn words etc and if you are old enough to watch such films - watch pulp fiction youll find how all of these can be fun then watch this picture again - and maybe youll find something you missedi didnt expect so many plots can be told awesomely through visual story this movies really reflect what relationship and marriages point of view from men and women and i like how they chose the cast for this movies men would loved rosamund pike and women would loved to watch ben affleck i even checked here who the director really is and found out david fincher also directed another several awesome movies i had watched before fight club se7en the curious case of benjamin button zodiac the girl with the dragon tattoo i didnt realize that before but now i will be waiting another movies from himi did not see any movie ever like this one. this just showed an expect-able superhero to all of us. the joker really gave something especial acts to entertain us and he will be remembered forever. this movie actually taught us something that we can do anything as a society and in a society we need someone to guide us to move forward. why do we fall sir so that we can learn to pick ourselves up- alfredcharacter from this movie . this is a sentence that i am using in my real life now when i got frustrated. i think this movie must be rated 10. the directorchristopher nolan and the character batmanchristian bale was really successful to give what they expected and what viewers want. to sum up the director was able to show the activity about the social anti-corruption and this is great movie of all time.i did not read the books before watching this well i read the fellowship the ring the first on before watching just this movie the third. because i loved the first two to death. and i am writing this review for all three because i see them as one big movie divided by three. but i think the return of the king is the best one so that is why i write the review here. i think the lord of the rings trilogy is the best movie/movies in history. great acting great environments great characters great story great world great....i could go on forever. everything is just perfect. i could not say much more. just watch it all three movies and you will be crushed by movie beauty crushed under the feet by this undefeated masterpiece. best movie of all time. thank mr. peter jackson and jjr tolkien for this.i definitely wanted to see this movie as i am a huge fan of the disney version of sleeping beauty but i was still cautious being a fan helped me to enjoy and appreciate what they were trying to do with this movie after viewing maleficent i ended up loving the movie the acting the costumes and sets the story the emotion the humoreverything was superb i especially loved angelina jolie honestly no one could have done a better job if i had one criticism it would be that compared to the disney cartoon aurora in maleficent was not pretty enough elle fanning is ok looking maybe sort of pretty aurora in sleeping beauty? gorgeous by far the the prettiest disney princess of all in my honest and biased opinion all in all a great movie that only the trolliest of trolls would nitpick see iti couldnt wait to see gone girl ive loved most of david finchers movies with seven and zodiac being 2 movies i cant get enough of not to mention that word of mouth was saying it was another masterpiece and it is its awesome this moody thriller sees ben affleck as the centre of attention as his wife rosamund pike goes missing from here i dont really want to give anything else away as the movie really does go in as many different directions as you could possibly squeeze into a 2 and a half hour long flick i was thinking i had it sussed at first knowing that there were a couple of twists on the horizon but the fact that it can mislead you so easily is probably the reason why the film has become as popular as it has become there is virtually no way you will predict where this movie is going and when you think you have your wrong gone girl is a brilliantly twisted thriller that has a dark and complicated plot that will have you hooked on a film that manages to breath new life into the careers of many of its stars too ben affleck and neil patrick harris impress with their serious performances though the film has a sarcastic sense of humour at times too but the breakout star here is one time bond girl pike who is actually amazing as the gone girl of the titlei couldnt believe the dark knight could live up to the hype. thats perhaps the biggest surprise. the secret i believe is a stunning mature intelligent script. that makes it the best superhero movie ever made. as if that wasnt enough heath ledger. he the newest of the tragic modern icons present us with a preview of something well never see. a fearless extraordinary actor capable to fill up with humanity even the most grotesque of villains. his performance is a master class. fortunately christian bales batman is almost a supporting character. bale is good but there is something around his mouth that stops him from being great. the dark knight is visually stunning powerful and moving. what else could anyone want.i consider this movie as one of the most fantastic and joyful movie to watch. it touch a social problem that few movie directors and producers took the risk of doing like the institutionalized thing. all of the stories developed in this movie even if they are all related of the main character every own little story is very interesting and full of emotions. this movie contains good drama a different comedy insight. i think i have seen this movie at least 6 times and i just dont get tire of watch in it i think every time i watch it i found new things.i highly recommend to spend time enjoying this amazing movie and just a piece of advice is take the time to read a little bit the reviw and find no one bad.i come from a region where commercial movies have been so dominant over the years that most people now judge films on how good the item songs were. even in hollywood the film industry has for long been dominated by cheap parlor tricks and flicks. to see a movie of such utter artistry class and creativity has thus been long awaited for me. this is a superhero fiction which seems real to say the least. unlike most movies of its genre the dark knight does not end in a fistfight between the hero and the villain but turns into a battle between the dual nature of mankind. every camera angle every single word of each character every beat of the background music every expression of each actor every twist in the storyline speaks on its own. the storyline is spectacular. right from the first scene the movie focuses on the brutality of the joker the simple joy he feels by bringing about chaos and destruction. the joker will forever be the greatest villain of all time. he is a man of mysterious background questionable character and by his own accord an agent of chaos. the acting direction and screenplay of this movie is pure artistry. christopher nolan does not rely on high tech special effects but exhibits a high degree of intelligence on each of his films. christian bale has been very rightly referred to as the real batman by many. and spare a thought for the great heath ledger who played out each scene while playing the highly complex role of the joker to absolute and absolute perfection. the dark knight is by its own right the everest of superhero filmsi choose chaos says the joker in one of the early scenes in the movie and those words sum up whats in store in the dark knight. directed by the supremely talented christopher nolan the dark knight is a masterfully woven tale of anarchy and heroism that captivates you right from the opening scene. the events of the dark knight take place a few months from where batman begins left off. gotham city continues to be a lawless frontier where organized crime flourishes but billionaire playboy bruce wayne christian bale is warming to the idea that the city may have found a hero in district attorney harvey dent played by aaron eckhart. enter heath ledger as the joker dont let the name cuckold you. this joker is no circus clown he has no background and his origins remain a mystery. he is to be put simply an anomaly in a world constantly striving to be normal. the joker does what he does best: unleashing chaos on the streets of gotham city. batman on the other hand is trying his best to clean the scum off the streets of gotham. it is this yin-yang relationship between the caped crusader and his lawless adversary that forms the crux of the dark knight. nolan manages to extract superlative performances from all his cast members. christian bale is solid and stoic as our caped crusader. aaron eckhart delivers a sterling performance. maggie gyllenhaal gary oldman morgan freeman and michael caine provide ample support. but it is heath ledger playing the joker with fire breathing abandon who indisputably steals the show. whether its the opening scene where hes robbing a bank or when hes showing his little magic trick to the mob ledger shows how you need to be tightly wound up and totally in control even when delivering a crazy out-of-control performance. as i had read somewhere _„_ he plays forrest gump gone mad but with Í©lan to call it the best superhero movie of all time would be the greatest disservice you could do to the genius of christopher nolan. the movie creates a place where good and evil _„î expected to battle it on _„î decide instead to get it on and dance. brilliantly bleak and chillingly gothic the dark knight soars on the wings of nolans savage imaginationi cant stop thinking how lotr:ttt and lotr:rotk would be if were not filmed together with the first film.maybe peter jackson would thought that he should change some elements of the two last films in order to improve them resulting in many complains by the audience because the two towers and the return of the king lack the atmosphere of the first one.on the other hand maybe he could actually make them even betterhistory made me doubt this perspective.no one really knows .what we already know is that jackson had some excellent material into his hands and made some wise decisions about how he would use them.way to go mr jacksonnow give us silmarilion on screen too...i cant say enough about this movie would give it 11 stars if possible after you get past the opening 10 minutes of sentimental dreck which really is not bad the rest of the movie never stops exceeding expectations when i was 9 i saw star wars in the theater with my father i knew nothing about it except that there were lines all summer at every movie theater where it was showing i remember being mesmerized and thinking it was the greatest movie of all time this is the first movie experience since then that i felt that way about see it in the theater you will be transported back to when you were a kid at the movies and everything was simpler when it was over i immediately wanted to go see it again this is no superhero movie it is much much more the action is there but this is more than an action moviei cant really think of one thing i didnt like about this movie everything from the costumes the sets make up hair acting writing directing and editing all the best of the best amazing work pulpfiction i must admit is a stellar piece of cinema a literally star-studded cast portrays the characters beautifully making you feel their joy and pain plot wise there are numerous twists and turns as to be expected but they all manage to fit together rather nicely and while some things do remain unexplained or unaccounted for in the end it doesnt leave the viewer wanting dialogue in this movie is particularly delightful with much reverence to dark humor and double-talk not unlike the film lucky number slevin ultimately the scenes i really like were with uma thurman i think tarantino delivered a solid piece worthy of the place its earned in the upper echelons of most critics top 10i cant figure out why i love this movie so much i have seen it more times than i can count and still it never gets old it is a very unique movie i particularly love the ending and think it is the best scene in cinema history some great acting by samuel l jackson the movie isnt meant to have a moral which is indicated from the pulp part of the title but in not trying to teach us a lesson the film hits even harder with one  i believe the movie is actually very deep with themes such as forgiveness and redemption one moment butch is about to kill marcellus the next he is saving him jules is wrapped up in the life of crime and suddenly he sees a sign from god that he is a terrible person and he acts on this from jules passage he has an epiphany that what he has being doing is wrong and realizes he needs to help someone else to start his journey towards redemption everyone has something they want to change in their life something they want improved this was just the beginning of jules transformation though he isnt just stopping and forgetting allÇ_ he has done wrong he feels he owes a favor to the world and that was just the beginning transformation if you have seen the movie you will understandi cant figure out how a man could think such an outrageous concept like thatits just beneath all the beautiful thing.thanks to frank drabountmorgan freemantime robbins.excellency is sky high in this film.not a movieits just a lifetime experience.sometimes people felt to sad they curse themselvesregret for everything they have done in life.they crush for successrun after money.buthere is the thing that changes everything and it is indeed the hope.no matter how bad you feelno matter how hard the path of the life isthe show is still goes on if you have just one thing and that is the hope.life would certainly changes if peoples take the deep meaning of this wonderfully executed movie.probably it will help many people to start their life for the second timehats off to everyone who worked with the shawshank redemption team..i cant believe that something so simply good exists. this is by far the best thing i have ever watched on my tv. i loved every piece of it and im gonna watch it once a year till my time on this world is over. i cant describe the feeling and joy you will have after watching it because i cant find the right words to describe it. watch it and you will see what i mean. the first time is always the best. its the time when it will leave you speechless for a couple of seconds. and after those seconds you will begin to understand that you just watched a masterpiece. what i liked the most is the big time span in which the movie plays. all those years in one place and the dependence for some people after you leave it.i cant believe that around december this year we wont be having any lotr movie. im in denial and am convinced that peter jackson will make a new movie to tie up all the loose ends. they should have made this into an epic miniseries. too many things left unsaid and undone in the return of the king. not that its not a good movie -- its the best ive seen so far.. and as the finale of the lotr trilogy it does go with a bang rather than a whimper that matrix revolutions did. lotr die hard fans want more.... thats why we are waiting for the extended version of the video. we need some closure...  one of my favorite shots in the film seems to be a homage to both the fast-paced unbreaking style of scorseses goodfellas and roman polanskis rosemarys baby. it is the scene where travolta crashes his malibu into eric stoltzs front yard and brings the oded thurman inside his house. as rosanna arquette hurls invectives at the two the camera wonderful work by andrez sekula moves back and forth between arquette and travolta and stoltz lurching over thurman thats the scorsese part. then as stoltz goes looking for the plunger the camera follows him into a room where it inexplicably stops at the doorway so as to impede a full sight of stoltz reminders of the scene where polanski photographed ruth gordon in rosemarys baby by placing an obstruction between her and the camera so the audience would instinctively lurch their head to the side making a hopeless attempt to see around the obstruction. such a phrase can be used to describe pulp fiction: most movies simply unfurl their stories at the audience. this movie subliminally makes you a part of the action. i recently had a semi-argument with a friend over the worth of this film over natural born killers. now dont get me wrong oliver stone is a powerful filmmaker but his film banged you over the head incessantly with points like im going to use my artistic license to satirize the over-the-top violence of popular culture by making a movie replete with...over-the-top violence in the style of david spade its called hypocrisy oliver--check into it anyways i digress. anybody who bad-mouths this movie indeed has no appreciation for cinema  sure the film may have a goof or an errant philosophy somewhere  but tarantino fulfilled any filmmakers dream in revitalizing cinema. you can say that the films tone didnt impress you that its style wasnt to your taste...but you cant deny the artistry that went into it. morality for all of those who believe this film is an amoral travesty i suggest you rent the family favorite the santa clause and count how many times disney shamelessly milks its own products or if god is mentioned even once in what is supposed to be a christmas film. or in any family film. what impressed me the most when i first saw pulp fiction was its inclusion of god at all many generation-x filmmakers paging kevin smith are so agnostic in their beliefs that it was so refreshing to see one that painted divinity in such a positive light. you can have those other indie favorites chasing amy and good will huntingboth starring those irritating crybabies matt damon and ben affleck and if you like those cynical films which are basically reworkings of oh-feel-sorry-for-me melodramas of the late-40s reworked with equally irritating alternative rock best summed up by the smashing pumpkins in a simpsons episode: alls we got is our millions of dollars our legions of fans and our youth. then you can have them. compare that to jules awakening i was just sitting here eating my muffin and drinking my coffee when i had what alcoholics refer to as a moment of clarity. and youll see how tarantino turned the mythic gen-x stereotype on its head as well. pulp fiction is in my opinion the king of the indies and one of the best examples of cinematic craftsmanship ever.i believe that the film did more than enough justice to the science factfiction part of it with this movie christopher nolan tried to answer some questions that science is yet to the transition form fact to fiction was seamless even though some of the sequences in the movie are open to scientific debate they are simply beautiful  visually and emotionally as far as the story goes i could care less as the stunning visuals and great background  more than makes up for it for those who are not fully satisfied with the story i can understand could be because of a very high bar set by christopher nolan himself however dont let it hold you back if you like nolans movies if youre gonna watch it watch it in imax i avoided seeing this film for years because i thought it was a grim prison uprising tale from stephen king. well i was one third right it is set in a prison but it is a very good story about friendship honesty forgiveness/redemption patience and loyalty. im going to really try and not give away too much of the film because if you havent seen it yet you are missing out on a great story. its set in a prison in the late 40s. some of the inmates have been there since the early part of the 20th century and with repeated parole denials and no rehabilitation in sight many have been institutionalized and have lost hope and even lost sight of their own identity. when one such inmate is released he walks into a world that he barely recognizes. he tries but in the end fails to make it in the real world and succumbs to desperation and hopelessness. we see some of the guards greedily taking part in violence that is so vicious that it is difficult to discern the prisoners from the prison staff. but ultimately it is a tale of redemption and the story unfolds with hardship humor and grace. this is a film that i will see again and again.i am usually never short on words... but i was stunned to silence... utter disbelief and sheer awe...this is a masterpiece... no two ways about it... and everyone can just forget about sending in their applications for the oscars... this is signed sealed and delivered... not that it is any mark of greatness.. but as far as pop-culture goes heath ledger has left an undeniable mark on what acting can be and just why the villain can be the hero of the movie.... heres my 2-bit review christian bale : solid as ever... this guy cant put a wrong foot down... he as batman is everything batman should be brooding honest powerful conflicted heroic tragic... everyone of those emotions and more are portrayed with the greatest justice... michael cain and morgan freeman: small roles but significant nonetheless. michael cain in particular left me impressed with he bandit in the forest story... and morgan freemans so much power in one mans hands was so apt and so relevant if-you-know-what-i-mean with bushs wiretapping etc... maggie gylenhall: well i didnt like her before the movie... but i must say i dont resent her anymore... gary oldman: one my favorite actors... one of my favorite all time characters sirius black from the harry potter series... as gordon he is terrific. and the last part where he does the voice-over monologue youd have to be made of concrete to not feel a major chill down your spine... is there an award for voice-overs then it should go to gary oldman... aaron eckhart... liked him from erin brokovich loved him in thank you for smoking... and as harvey dent he does justice... and as two-face he does even more so... and now heath ledger... any accolade i can come up will fall short... there simply is no comparison to anyone... heath is in a world of his own... his psychopathic maniac turn as joker is so perfect that the 1989 jack nicholson portrayal pales in comparison... dont get me wrong i love jack nicholson to bits but heath is jaw-dropingly brilliant for a lack of a better word... someone has to invent a new word to express what heath has achieved... there is nothing that compares to this...every single scene he is in is a work of genius... his smirk the madness in his eyes...the immunity to pain... and the penchant for suffering is striking... even the scene where he claps at gary oldman... is so utterly disgustingly devilish that its pure cinematic magic... christopher nolan has entered the echelon of the great directors... this sweeping epic of a movie hits all the right notes and more... the background  is brilliant the special effects used to intensify the drama not just for the sheer heck of it... every single bit of the movies scripting is tied in so beautifully and so relevant that its astounding... my favorite moment when the joker tells why hes got the scar around his mouth and you think you have this maniac figured... you know the reason for his malice... but then he turns around and spins and entirely different story to another one of his victims... there go all your theories about the joker... you know that this guy is nothing but evil incarnate... there will be no greater loss for cinema goers than the knowledge that heath will not be able to reprise his role... there would have been nothing better... just to see heath as the joker one more time... rip heath ledger... this is your legacy...  andy with his close friend in the prison  red  tries redemption from this prison by the time  andy tries to do beneficial things for people in the prison not to attract attention. it is unbelievable that they escape from this prison. but  andy approaches to place of exit. it is actually amazing  it is really incredible. they go to their dreams to live a peaceful and quiet life. also  andy prepares a trap for the chief of the jail. after the redemption  they become free anymore. it is really an amazing movie. easily one of the best movies made during the 90s and definitely one of the top prison movies of all-time. pretty much everything about this movie works and works extremely welli am sure this has been said before but pulp fiction is one of my favourite movies i have watched it numerous times and with each viewing more details appear it is almost impossible to suggest that one would be able to predict every twist and every turn that occurs in this film tarantino breaks the typical chronological order in which a movie usually functions this is what makes pulp fiction so intelligent it is a particularly unusual feeling that occurs when the movie comes full circle and returns to the beginning as a means to conclude it is a tool he can use to provoke different reactions from viewers for example the death of a main character vincent during the middle of the movie comes as a shock especially when he resurrects unscathed scenes later it is the lack of chronology that allows tarantino to play with his characters whilst keeping their roles prominent this is never easy when applied to a movie in chronological order for example the death of llewellyn moss in no country for old men leaves the focus on anton chigurh though this is a coen brothers production and not a tarantino one it still assists in illustrating the importance of tarantinos chronological confusion as well as tarantinos intelligent filming method he uses a cast that match their characters personality for example samuel l jackson usually plays the role of a tough yet eccentric and interesting type and christopher walken plays tends to play knowledge filled and enigmatic characters i am in no way saying these actors are generic i merely scrape the surface of what they are capable of tarantinos characters as well as other roles played by these actors have detailed and interesting back-stories which add a significant amount of detail to the plot he leaves the viewer with such quotable phrases such as jules ezekiel 25:17 passage which i have found is a favourite when friends come to quote the movie as if the plot characters and dialogue is not enough to gain the viewers undivided attention it is padded with a number of details that are not directly linked to the plot yet still add interesting twists to the story this is why the movie has to be viewed at least twice to understand most of the aspects that occur it is tarantinos intelligent use of the minor details that make this film what it is for example the significance of his characters in relation to his other films when given insight is mind-blowing vincent vega being a direct link to reservoir dogs vic vega and the consistent time on all of the clocks  agreed i have only touched the surface of what this movie is about yet the detail on which this film is based cannot be put directly into words i can simply pick up on the intelligent use of dialogue characters the numerous twists and turns that occur and the small yet significant details that can be observed so i really do suggest you give it a watch :i am so happy to see this film top 1 in imdb. it deserves to be there. the shawshank redempion appears in 1994 i think this year was full of amazing pictures. it lost oscars but gained recognition. this is a great story about friendship and redemption. frank darabonts best movie for sure. andy dufresne is one of the greatest characters ever made in the cinema art. a guy who is innocent and get punished. this film shows us that even our intention is a crime in a law world. no one is perfect and no one can predict anything. we live by a scheme and trying to be fair. people will always make mistakes and the greatest thing is to learn from them. i am waiting for movies which can touch me like this one but after year 2000 nothing close to that appears. there were great films about life and stuff but still its a modification a copy thereof what was before. i think until year 2000 most of valuable things in film art was told. its a little sad but this kind of art will always be deep in my heart as a lesson and beauty how fantastic picture man create. i hope there will be at least couple movies in my short life that leave so many emotions like the shawshank redemption. in xxi century it is a very hard thing to do. i am patient and have positive thinking that cinema didnt say the last words.  and i respect that. however what i dont understand is why someone would say that tarantino is a bad or not good enough director. its simply not true and you know it this movie was done very well in more areas than one. somehow the characters seem more natural in their behaviour the way they speak etc. the stories arent deep and the plot isnt very rich because it isnt supposed to be. this is just a look at some criminals caught in some interesting and messy situations. in order to really like this movie you need to set all your expectations aside and --very important-- watch it more than once. youll probably like this movie even more the second time. but if you didnt like it a bit the first time you saw it -- dont waste your time find something else to watch. this is the kind of film that you either love or hate. i love it. the cast is great the acting is amazing. the characters are very vivid and interesting. and even though some of the situations are a little outrageous tarantino still made them believable. butchs story was very entertaining and jules is just the coolest - i like how he handles the coffee shop robbers at the end even though its not really the end... and the soundtrack -- fabulous. i think tarantino has good pretty good taste in music. you wont find any s for his movies though - just really cool tunes from the sixties and seventies that were once popular but were forgotten. as for the violence... there isnt much of it really. yes you heard me right. next time you see pulp fiction count the number of times you see a really violent scene and youll realize its not more than any other action/crime movie... and notice that they dont show that much -- its mostly your imagination filling in what the camera doesnt show you. i recommend this movie to all true motion picture fans. i am more of a sciencefiction person that watches movies mostly for their effects and massive scenes i decided to check this one since i am a fan of the two main actors this was one of my best decisions regarding movie choice the movie starts normally with the story of the two main actors and how they are related the viewer is left with the impression that this will be another interesting story of a married couple and their struggles this goes until the plot twists so hard that you almost need to pause to comprehend what happened the plot is so well thought that you get the aha and so thats what happened moments every few minutes but it is apparent enough to let the viewer intelligent enough to guess some of the scenes just so they get astonished with the next one the movie leaves the viewer with the impression that there is a goodbad guy plot in the movie until the very end when the scenario twists again and leaves the viewer astonished and questioning if theres a bad character at all and what would they do in the characters placei am a nerd when it comes to lord of the rings probably not as big as others but being a nerd i have to say that this is my favorite movie of the amazing trilogy. i just love how well the movie was made and the action sequences always make my heart start pumping. the music is glorious to listen to and the movie as a whole is enchanting. plus it has amazing actors doing amazing things. i would definitely recommend this movie to anyone who has not seem it...but only if you have seen the first two you have to see the first two in order for parts to make sense and click. it is one of those movies that you can practically can watch with anyone anytime.i am a huge fan of batman . since i was little  he was a inspiration and today he still is . i had a dream that one day a hero like this  a story like this will have its place among the best movies of all times . when i first saw it  i had a major goosebumps all over my body and i was shocked by the greatness of achievement that nolan did it with this movie . i literally love everything about this movie  i see no flaws and it still keeps me intense when i watch it . heath ledgers acting was a masterpiece  heath have changed things forever  . christian bale is a best bruce wayne that can be in this movie industry and i am so sad that he will never do it again . these guys had a great support by their colleagues  oldman  gyllenhaal  caine  freeman and eckhart  . and what would a movie be without a musical masterpiece of hans zimmer  he just blew my mind with this inspirational  dark and epic music . ive always talked about this movie with my friends and they were always smiling because they taught it was just a silly batman movie . but when theyve seen it  their comments changed and today they are still keep thanking me for my silly persuasion . congratulations to nolan for doing a very damn good job on making this movie .i am a 38 years old man from england who works for the second biggest oil company in the world......... i have : lovely family......great friends.....good job....... the film is perfect time and time again every time you watch it  talking points  settings & locations  actors  so much feeling  fantastic   and everybody involved in the production produced a masterpiece.......... extra special thanks to frank darabont  i sincerely hope you are very happy and everything in your life is good .............. a total must have in the collection............. thank you trevi always define films as an artistic medium for a person to immerse himself to a place full of positivity and hope in an unending hymn. and for generation after generation theres only one film that i will always give praise for finally giving a masterpiece that successfully delivers that thought. a film called the shawshank redemption. never has been before the film came out illustrates the triumph of human spirit behind any hardship in the most moving manner until this inspiring film. its powerful in every way that for me it brought back the real definition of an excellent film which is a great story with great characters. mainly about andy duferne tim robbins a skilled banker who was convicted for murdering his wife and her third party whos a pro golfer. duferne sentenced for double life imprisonment was sent to the notorious and sullen looking shawshank prison to serve his sentence. while counting his days inside several events happened to andy. meeting the sisters  was one of his hardships he needed to go thorough as they sexually assault selected prisoners like him which made his stay harder and longer than he thought. one day he also met ellis redding morgan freeman who was literally known to get things and run it through the walls of the prison as andy asked him for a hammer. unknown to andy redding had his bet on him earlier as the first one amongst the newest batch of inmates to break down. subtlety the two became prison buds as the days became months and the months became years. the two almost stick together the whole time of their stay. they conversed things about the realities of prison. which at times they contradicted at each others opinion for andy had always been the hopeful dreamer and redding with his face of realism. the story soon evolves into great circumstances in favor of andy in spite of being a workhorse inside the prison exploited by several police and the warden himself for his skill of handling money andy through his skill will and hope proved that there were great things waiting to happen for those who hoped and wait. for he always believed that hope is a great thing that everyone should always have. the shawshank redemtion is a film for the ages. its beauty as a whole will never fade as it is one of those greatest films that show an almost tangible message to fathom. it is substance over style at the end of the day. and what it evokes is what matters which leaves you moved and some even satisfied for every tear that they shed from an abundance of happiness gave by a magnificent piece of literature. its the best film ive seen and it will always be carved to the bank of triumphant feeling. truly excellent 10/10.i adored this movie. if it doesnt get an oscar for best picture something is very rotten in la la land. it was uniformly superb. the battle scenes were stunning. i got dizzy watching them i applaud peter jackson and the rest of the fellowship.i admit it i love all three lord of the rings films. people may say return of the king is the best of the trilogy some may say it is the worst. i personally think two towers is the best for its scope and better exploration of some of the characters but while it is still great return of the king is better than fellowship of the ring. my only slight disappointment is the ending it does feel overlong and bloated for me almost as if there was more than one ending filmed. that said what does make the ending at least watchable for me is the way it is shot the marvellous  and the performance of gollum. despite this minor discrepancy return of the king is extremely good and in my view one of the better best picture winners last decade. peter jacksons direction is very impressive here and the scope is massive and just dazzling to watch. all three films of the trilogy are very well made but return of the king defines the term epic. the cinematography is mind-blowing the scenery is superb the costumes and make-up are well tailored the effects are superb and dont distract too much and the lighting is authentic. the  is phenomenal. fellowship of the ring had some ethereal rousing haunting and charming themes whereas two towers was somewhat darker and more complex. return of the king merges these together and the result is a perfect mixture of charm darkness etherality and complexity. the story is compelling with themes of friendship strength and loyalty the screenplay is well-written and literate and while the film is very long the three hours or so fly by seamlessly. the characters are engaging aragorn is even more interesting here than he is in the previous films while gollum continues to steal every scene he appears in. the acting is very good. orlando bloomwho i can find dashing yet uncharismatic and bland and john rhys-davies are given less to do but do carry their parts very well and elijah wood is likable enough. sean astin captures sam perfectly and provides the heart of the picture and viggo mortenssen is at his charismatic best here. ian mckellen is perfectly cast while the design of gollum is still superb and andy serkis is equally phenomenal. i was slightly disappointed by the lack of any sarauman but i was more than i was satisfied with the final result. all in all an outstanding entry to a great trilogy. 10/10 bethany coxi actually enjoyed much of rotk but i found it lacking in some major ways especially compared to the first two installments of the lotr trilogy. 1 i found the whole scene in which eowyn and merry defeat the lord of the nazgul to be rather flat which is in stark contrast to the portrayal of this scene in the book - it just lacked the high drama found in the books depiction. 2 omitting the houses of the healing left unanswered the question as to what happened to eowyns passion for aragorn - my wife who has never read the books wouldve been really confused had i not been there as a second source to explain how eowyn fell in love with faramir. 3 leaving out the scouring of the shire made for a complete letdown at the end of the movie. this for me is the gravest mistake of the entire movie trilogy. the scouring of the shire in the book summarizes the whole moral of the story and shows that the travelers i.e. frodo sam merry and pippin had learned to stand on their own two hobbit-feet and werent just coat-tail riders. i hope its jacksons intent to include 2 and 3 from above in the extended video when it gets released. otherwise i will believe that in the very end of the story jackson failed to deliver the whole goods as promised.i absolutely loved this movie not only is it the best of the series but it is also the one that most closely matches the books in terms of the feel of tolkien and middle earth. an outstanding achievementi absolutely love this movie the first time i saw it i thought it was excellent but i didnt really get a good taste of it until watching it two more times its the type of movie you just have to see more than once because of all the plot twists and turns tarantinos dialogue is great and the acting is downright amazing samuel jackson is unbelievable i really like this moviei absolutely love the shawshank redemption. when a movie gives me goosebumps it has done its job. where to start. the acting in this movie is sublime. i had never seen any movie starring tim robbins but morgan freeman is one of my favorite actors. tim robbins portrays an intriguing man. he and morgan freeman work together extremely well. the story itself is brilliant. a banker wrongfully put in prison would not seem that interesting but with these people and their conversations and companionship its certainly worth a watch. i was sad when i thought the director killed off andy dufresne at the end but when i realised he had actually escaped i couldnt stop smiling until the movie was over. this movie certainly deserves the #1 spot in the top 250 movies as its a must see for everyone.how wonderful when you went to the theater for this movies and 4 hours later you walked out with such a good feeling and simply forgot to realize that 4 hours had passed.this is such an amazing experience. the movie is such a great epic with good and evil great battle spectacle landscape characters with great spirit. from one of the greatest books which had many details the masterful adaptation of jackson and co bring them all to life without loosing the heart. the visual presentation is breathtaking sure you have never seen things like this before and it will be the greatest challenge for the next generation film makers to beat tough work for sure. all the art work is as good as the first two and howard shore masterful music simply be everything the movie  should and suppose to be wow. though overall the acting is not that excellence but it is really really good enough to be part of and a supporting for this instant-classic final installment. ........sean astin........as sam is the most memorable character from this cast he grab the audiences heart with the goodwill and loyal of his character especially the scene at the mount doom and oscar nomination for him will not surprise me. and yes i love to see more of blanchetts galadriel the first class screen performer in such noble and powerful looks but even a very small role here she still be as great as she is always be why you are so unlucky with the oscar...so unfair. dear peter jackson thank you very much for guided visionary your highest ambitious and strong will to achieve it and of course you did it remarkably. many may think like me what is your genius brain looks like..how superb the return of the king is. it is the ultimate fantasy film and a sure bet for all the film awards this year. director peter jackson has achieved the impossible to make this trilogy and make it so that tolkien fans will be pleased with it in comparison to the book. the special effects are amazingly good the actors sean astin who play samwise gamgee particularly are fabulous in their roles and the plot is unflawed representing the book perfectly. there are parts left out but this was always to be expected. peter jackson on first editing the film had a 6 hour long film that he was happy with. now although us lord of the rings fans may have been more than happy to sit through that i dont think others would have been so inevitably pieces and lines from the book have been taken out. but what we are left with is a film that works perfectly and is a masterpiece. undoubtedly there will be plenty of extra footage on the extended dvd and so well just have to wait for that to see the film in its entirety. its arguably and in my own opinion the best of the three films and one that fans and just movie-goers will love. its got action romance and an ending that leaves us satisfied and wanting to see it again and again. go and see it nowhow on earth is this film attracting so much criticism? this is one of the best films of 2014 and people are labelling it utter tripe an enormous heap of illogic and nonsense wish i had missed it are these people serious? can we no longer appreciate  or even identify  a great film? gone girl is a peerless plotdriven story about a wife who goes missing seems pretty ordinary right? well its not and it doesnt take very long at all for any sane viewer to recognise this you start watching and  as you do with any mystery  you start collecting the clues and piecing together an explanation for the events which have taken place but no sooner than you have formed the perfect explanation in your mind is it immediately swept away in the most overwhelming twist of the year and it only gets better from there gone girl is a rollercoaster only youre riding it in the dark you dont know where the next turn is you cant see where youre headed and you have no idea how many more ups and downs youre going to experience before its all over its a film that keeps you guessing and just as youre beginning to once again think youve got it all figured out the game changes and its all up in the air once more the diaryexposition format is also very clever and was executed perfectly many films fall victim to losing the viewer when jumping back and forth between past and present yet gone girl  you guessed it  does it just right this film ranks high in the mysterythriller genre it is just as compelling and perplexing as shutter island  if not then moreso and lets not forget the acting ben affleck and rosamund pike do a phenomenal job in their roles as husband and wife not a line feels out of place and both seem as though they were born to play nick and amy dunne by the end of the film i felt so immersed in their story that i found it hard to believe it was just a film all in all i for one am thoroughly pleased with gone girl i knew from watching the trailer it would be something i would like i just never imagined it could thrill me this much a very underrated and overwhelming story that should be enjoyed by allhope is a good thing and this movie

you to brilliant acting and the dramatic presence of dark knight. so at best most superhero movies are just cool because of all the crazy fight/action scenes... but wow dark knight is easily the darkest most well-made and most adult superhero flick ever. not that batman begins didnt do that its just that the dark knight did it 10 times better. i know everyone is talking about heath ledger as the joker and its no surprise to me because he was amazing. i wasnt planning on seeing the dark knight on opening weekend.. maybe not even in theaters. but all my friends went to the midnight shows on friday and convinced me of how amazing it was that i saw in sunday afternoon. and even on the 3rd day the theater was sold out. i know what youre thinking. im just giving ledger a good review because he died. but to be honest i never payed much attention to heath ledger before because i really didnt think he was that great of an actor. so to me it was weird how much praise he was getting when he died. then again... this happens when any actor or actress dies. no matter how good or bad people thought they were before when they die its like people feel bad and say only the nicest things like she/he was the best actor of our generation... even when they probably werent. but god damn... heath ledger was absolutely amazing in dark knight. never seen him like that before and didnt know he could commit to a role like the joker the way he did. going into the theater if i didnt know heath ledger is playing the joker i still wouldnt know until i saw his name in the credits. its not so much that he was playing the role really well it was more like heath ledger had disappeared and he was the joker. its hard convincing your audience and making the joker a believable character in this very dark and realistic version of batman but ledger did it flawlessly. the dark knight is heath ledgers swansong. his best role yet. its just a shame he wont be around for the 3rd film. he completely stole the spotlight in the movie. as a member of the audience you find yourself wanting to just see more of the joker. he steals every scene hes in and you wish he was in every scene hes not. i swear this halloween... you wont see kids in the batman suit. youre going to see kids with white face paint fake scars on their cheeks and purple suits. i wouldnt be surprised at all if he got an oscar nomination for his performance and if he did id expect a win. christian bale as expected delivered another great performance as batman. only this time we saw a whole new side to the cocky confident billionaire bruce wayne. gotham city is going through its toughest time ever and you see that in bales discerning batman. i can see im writing on and on here. so ill just say this about the crew and supporting cast- christopher nolan - visionary director made gotham city darker deeper bigger yet more beautiful than ever. aaron eckhart - truly portrayed what you would expect of the most realistic version of two-face. michael caine - after his performance in batman begins youd only expect the best from caine as alfred and thats what we got in dark knight. maggie gyllenhaal - great acting ability tops katie holmes portrayal of rachel dawes for sure. gary oldman - what do you think morgan freeman - lucius fox in his most powerful moments. 10/10 - best superhero movie.... ever.honestly i have nothing bad to say about the movie the cast was amazing the plot was awesome even the little jokes and back stories were epic the effects were as in any marvel movie great the fact that they used old classic rock songs as the soundtrack makes me love it even more chris pratt is perfect for the role of star lord even though i would have liked seeing jenses ackles really love karen in the movie as well and lee they were all perfect for their roles would have liked seeing more of thanos though all in all it was money well spent seeing the movie just sad that the ship didnt sailhi i heard details about this movie first time two years ago from a friend. before that in some movie channels i used to see the title been shown but never saw it. a jail movie....slow..not for me.i was in college those days in the nineties. in 2007 when my friend told me that whenever he feel sad or down he thinks of this movie and moves on. i replied back for me its rocky he asked if i have seen it and when i told him that i did not the only answer he had was it..watch it and then compare it. now in 2009 with the recession going on lots of trouble in work and tensions of home and personal life for me. while changing channels i chanced upon this movie which had started and i had lost some ten minutes. i did not change the channels later and saw it in complete. the only reaction was tears in my eyes in the end and called my family and close friends. it was a shaking experience and i got my answer....i needed to get out of my jail. i sent mails to my friends about the movie and review few had seen it already and many did not. result more people watched it...and guess what i for the first time rated in this website for the movie. ..and i expect some of my friends also did it. this is the reason why after 15 years this movie is still alive because of its human spirit story....with more followers than fans. i hope that answers some of your doubts...... this movie is for those who are busy dying......and now know its important to get busy living.hi guys.........i saw this movie more than 10 times. after watching this movie i became a fan of batman and mainly christopher nolan. the way he projected the joker character was awesome. main highlight of this movie was joker. all credit goes to heath ledger who played joker character and nolan. heath ledger performance was master class. dialogues were simple and superb. i didnt know why nolan changed the actress who was playing rachel character in batman begins it was katie holmes but it didnt matter. script and screenplay were intelligent and stunning. climax scene was awesome and moving. i think its the best super hero movie i have ever seen. so its a must watch film.hey all all you guys are saying that movie shouldnt have huge rating because its not so good as it got ratedso for those people who think that they are looser they just cant see reality and dont wanna face it the beauty of movie iswho plays the boy of the title was 7 years old when the movie started filming and 18 when it finished as well as all crew included so its mean it had been 12 years to make a movie and the director have to wait for it but unfortunately he diedbut movie still accomplished by othersthis best shot i can give you this movie is awesome very natural and heart touching movie for people who have wisdom on upper portionheres my profile never saw sleeping beauty a medium sized fan of disney a cynic and i hate buying into over hyped disney blockbustersbut maleficent moved me deeply i honestly expected a movie like the snow white adaptation with charlize theron and instead it was twice as entertaining and quadrupled in meaning its twist on what true love really is just melted me i havent loved a movie this much in a long time it also renewed my subscription as an angelina fan i havent been interested in many of her flicks since changeling she truly is an exceptional woman a face performance and wardrobe so menacing yet her eyes still managed to convince you otherwise the innocence of elle fanning as an actress had me choked up half the time this is not a run of the mill disney good guy vs bad guy movie they really transformed the story into something unforgettable stand alone excellent filmheath ledgers role as the joker is nothing less than pure genius from his modernized look that truly captured the essence of this comic book villain to his perfectly creepy voice to his facial expressions and body movements. this is is one of my all time favorite films and i never tire of viewing it. while christian bale did a fine job as batman the film wouldnt be what it is if not for ledgers role as the joker. while there is a morbid element that surrounds the film due to ledgers death like lees untimely passing in the crow i believe the popularity of this film is most definitely due to the amazing acting ledger directing nolan music zimmer along with the hundreds of talented behind the scenes people and not because of ledgers unfortunate passing. if you havent seen this film i would be shocked but if you really havent just buy it because it should be in every movie fans collectionheath ledgers edgy portrayal of the joker is a frightening and macabre vision of the clown prince of crime. sure his costume is the right colours but shades of purple and green have never looked so muted like hes been dragged through the filth of alleys and gutters. his makeup is a halloween gone wrong: applied blood red over torture scars smudged & cracked white wash blacken sharks eyes of death capped by a entangled toxic green weave of hair. while his lip smacks and tongue snakes his many quotable psycho babble tirades on chaos and madness had this preview screening audience in silent shock and awe. as fans we wait to finally hear the jokers maniacal laughter...we are rewarded. but it is a chilling laugh that plays on our nerves with a subliminal shrilling echo that will haunt us long after the film. his facial twitches and deliberate gestures work to induce a hypnotic and mesmerizing hold on gotham/audience. his weapon of choice not the lint or veg peeler is the knife for both its ability to inflict a visceral cold kill and likely because it was an instrument of his own twisted grinning origin. the lack of origin story is also effective as an open book for the imagination. the hand held cam scenes of joker 1st pov filming his prey and the off cam torture is a stark reminder of the realty of terrorist footage. from the sick punch line of his disappearing pen trick to becoming a masochistic punching bag for the batman joker can certainly dish out as well as he gets. the joker casts pure fear into the minds of gotham by testing the citizens beliefs and moral lines of good and evil. this mad dog of chaos thrives in a world without rules where even the good of gotham can succumb to corruption and conflict. hence his handiwork in the transformation of gothams white knight to harvey two face dent. the eerie background music is like a deaf tone barbed-wire noise that rings through gothams cityscapes as a harbinger of the jokers evil to come. in all fairness ledger cannot be compared to nicholson. its apples and oranges. burtons 80s film delivered a comic book to screen thug turned clown which was hammed up with the flair and suave thats stamped with jacks vintage trademark. ledger has redefined the role and delivered a nightmare monster that wont let you awake or escape. all truly memorable screen villains are able to forever get into the mind of the protagonist and audience. it is with this performance that ledger/joker joins the ranks of the top three cerebral cinematic killers namely hopkins/lecter spacey/doe. this is a tour de force oscar worthy performance that lives up to the hype rare thing and even raises the bar even rarer. so kudos to ledger/nolan and tdk team for unleashing the perfect villain for the batman. and remember the next time youre playing a card game your hand may come up with the jokers signature calling card. rip hl.  shawshank redemption does one hell of a job. from the very get go shawshank will have you on the edge of your seats. tim robbins a man whose career was on an initial down hill slide with flops such as howard the duck redeemed himself and then some with his portrayal of a man who looses everything in a second and then spends 20 years trying to get it all back. robbins gave a calm misdemeanor to his character which always gave the impression that he had something planned that we were not expecting. morgan freeman gives in my opinion the best performance of his distinguishable career. he maintains a streetwise wisdom and this too me makes him the go to guy of the prison. his calm yet intelligent nature is kept through out the film and does not seem affected by andy but after the escape freeman does superbly in showing the contrast in the streetwise dealer of the prison to a man who misses his friend. thomas newmans compelling  sets a dark and ominous tone and does what many s dont  it reflects the thought of the characters as opposed to the tone of the scene. darabont created a diverse prison world from the street smart ones to the homesick ones to the rapists but i was not a fan of how racism was sidestepped in the movie. if i had one nit pick and this is scraping the bottom of the barrel  i would have expected a few racial slurs directed at some of the prisoners particularly red. it would have been true of the time but then again its not the point of the story. ultimately shawshank redemption is a masterpiece and has a powerful yet happy enough ending to touch the heart of anybody.  he did it nolan did it again all i can say to you whoever you might be is that cinema will never be the same anymore after interstellar nolan and his team bent all the rules and reinvented the art its not a movie its an experience and it will change you forever interstellar is not only a touching remarkable and unforgettable movie it is cinema itself and all the things it was meant to be as an artform a chance was given to matthew mcconaughey and all i can say is that he clinged to it with all his talent and passion and the result is this fantastic piece of art this unique performance by all means if you love cinema and an amazing story of humanity and sacrifice buy the ticket and watch the movie and if you do please let it be in imaxhaving never watched a tarantino film before i was recommended pulp fiction as an extremely striking and memorable film and among the most quoted films of all time. despite the initially confusing start with new characters and situations being introduced very quickly with no apparent connection with one another i was completely sucked in to the darkly comic and often disturbing world. the all-star cast were all brilliant especially john travolta and samuel l jackson who bounced off one another to make genuinely believable partners in crime. the final scene is both fantastically acted and is one of the most lasting images of the film. overall it is a gripping and hugely enjoyable film save for tarantinos appearance.having carried the burden of guiltily concealing a debt to peter jacksons widely known and acclaimed trilogy only now do i realise i can truly call myself a film fan. calling it outstanding brilliant perfect would simply being echoing past recognition which you already know of. up until the point of watching i was convinced the likes of other trilogies such as the repetition dodging toy story and star wars would always out do what i used see as a medieval fantasy filled with mythical creatures. yet theres something incredibly humane about lotr as a whole the pointy ears and hairy feet may dismiss such an idea but when the soundtrack swells as does your heart you get to quote the narrator of fight club: lost in oblivion. before watching i didnt know my elf from my hobbit now i know my gollum from my gandalf my gondor from my mordor. back in the two towers our hairy footed friends had grudgingly united with gollum who continues to offer his schizophrenic assistance of taking sam and frodo to an unknown entrance that will let them pass into mordor unnoticedhavent read the books yet but considering how good this movie wasi plan to get them. in this final chapter frodo bagginselijah wood and samwise gamgeesean astin continue their quest to mt. mt. doom in mordor to toss the one ring into the fire to destroy the dark lord sauron. meanwhile aragornviggo mortenson legolasorlando bloomgimlijohn rhys-davies and gandalfian mckellen prepare for war against saurons horde of uruk-hai in order to buy frodo time to make it the mt. doom. this film had action suspense heart and a great story. the acting was certainly oscar worthy. speaking of the oscars this film deserved all eleven it was nominated for but i dont need to say that because it did win all of them. the only thing i didnt like was the extended ending which kind of dragged a bit. one of the best films of the decade in my opinion.have you seen maleficent? its really good i

plundering the annals of obscure/cult/foreign cinema the manner in which it is presented makes it a marvellous work of art in its own right same thing applies here only more-so pulp fiction is an exquisite patchwork-quilt of a movie stitched together from ideas elements and scenes gathered together by tarantino during his formative years as a movie-obsessed video store clerk assembled with an unerring eye for detail and the vision of a true artist the film is a marvel to behold_„îover two and a half hours of pure cinematic brilliance which proves just as captivating for me now as when i first clapped eyes on it almost two decades ago bold and bloody with stunning performances from a wonderful ensemble cast a flawless soundtrack witty and highly quotable dialogue and even a character called brett this impeccable slice of gritty neo-noir is fully deserving of top marks 10/10have never been a comic book adaptation with so many details and so a devotion seen. even watching it often i see things i have not seen before. the structure of the story is the madness. always exciting and mit an initial sequence of you the stool skin. nolan has managed a gloomy character created and still a sinister and yet an enemy who seems to be the winner in all situations. although it is the viewer not immediately noticeable. im looking forward to the third part and hope that nolan nevertheless by the tragic death of ledger creates a dignified end of this fantastic and epic triloigy to find. so until then.have courage and be kind because kindness is powerful and magical this is the kind of corny sentiment that can turn me off luckily cinderellas syrupy sweetness is so hopelessly romantic that its sincerity swept me off me feet often reducing me to tears its the kind of oldfashioned filmmaking we need one that hearkens to the days when movies helped us forget our troubles instead of pointing them out with complete earnestness and a refreshing lack selfcommentary branagh brandishes the ubiquitous romance with more grace and fun than a fairygodmother could shake her wand at cinderella is a fleshed out version of the story you already know more focused on being charming than surprising you may ask do we need another cinderella movie? but this modern takes inherent loveliness reminds us why the term a cinderella story has become the ubiquitous term for any ragsto riches tale lily james in a stunningly beautiful turn as the titular servantturnedprincess possesses the grace vulnerability poise and animated quirk needed giving purpose to her characters unrestrained goodness the design is immaculate like a reallife disney story with british costume drama sensibilities even the  and narration which are relatively generic fit the emotional and regal tones of this honestly sad yet ultimately triumphant childrens fable okay so its not breaking new ground its simply an unabashed fairy tale with its soul deep in humanity however in a culture working so hard to comment on itself at every turn maybe cinderellas comfortable confidence in its own simplicity is the very thing making it groundbreaking emotionally powerful and sweetly entertaining cinderella is refreshingly pure disneymagicguardians of the galaxy is one of the least known comic books of marvel the only reason why the whole world aside of the fans of the source material are going to see this because its a marvel production but we should all admit that apart from the comic geek world nobody knew who rocket racoon and groot were before the film was announced nobody heard of starlord before chris pratt was attached to the project and most people hardly knew what it is actually about while many are still seeking for a doctor strange or an antman movie we should first get to know something that havent got enough attention before and wondrously these filmmakers introduce this mythology with huge love not only to its own but also to the fantasyadventure genre and its old classic form which easily delivers the sheer fun but even in the realm of explosions and zany worlds the best parts of the journey ended up being the scenes with the characters interacting and often to engage a set of great humor and drama that is already too much to ask for a ridiculously fun blockbuster it is certainly a space adventure it already offers a lot of strange alien designs and intergalactic action but the big stuff arent the only highlight of the movie the film would mostly focus on its characters nearly all of them may be aliens but their pathos and personalities are downtoearth how the team was formed is the same way how the avengers did they arent nice to each other but they had to get along so they may save the world or galaxy but here their motivations are either for revenge or money instead of heroic pride how they introduced themselves may be a little too over explained through their conversations the exposition is so relied on the dialogue but what keeps it from being exhausting is when those talks lead to a naturally clever punchline the film is just best when the heroes are developing their sudden friendship turning themselves from cold hearted thugs into a likable band of misfits the film also has a big love for the seventies music and it smartly uses it for peter quills last earthly thing hell ever possess in his otherworldly life these parts with the characters make the action the secondary appeal of the film but that doesnt always mean its a bad thing this is basically going back to the past blockbusters when rooting for the characters was more important than trying to advance the technicalstyle abilities but then it doesnt have any problem with the action except sometimes the space battles can be hard to follow but again whenever theres a humor in it the consistency goes back on track its simple fun sometimes nostalgic piece of adventure that doesnt have to be overserious to be outright compelling but it also does have some drama while it doesnt entirely embraces its sadness it at least gives some hints behind the characters and manifests the heart and brutality of their backstories eventually the actors are excellent indeed as they give plenty of shining and charismatic personalities to their awesome characters the plot may not be too sharp or its villains may not be so memorable but guardians of the galaxy still reaches its goal of lovingly introduces its universe to the ones whove never heard of it since everyone is aware that superhero movies are made for the mass more than its fans lets have to be honest about this this idea may not always be taken seriously especially when comic book movies have gone to its dark and gritty era and yet this one offers us stuff like a talking tree and a gunslinging raccoon but here it is guardians of the galaxy the movie that isnt meant to exist ending up being one of the greatest films that marvel ever produced since iron man is it a bold choice for them? probably but its really not hard having selfawareness the triumph of the film is reliving the classic somewhat campy space opera and marking its characters as its real deal even when they are not as familiar as many of marvels heroes in the end its just pure fun the flaws are there but at some point it doesnt matter every moment of the film has the excitement and laugh that anyone would seek for a blockbuster taking place in a fascinating new world that we are yet to fully exploreguardians of the galaxy is nothing short of an amazing movie if theres anything i can say its that it is the best superhero movie i have seen not only does it have the impressive set pieces and enough action to last you a lifetime it has an emotional core and you actually get to care about each and every single character overall this movie is filled with all the required thrills and spills and is a first class action movie it also has a great mixture of comedic value and a deal of seriousness the films unlikely hero is quill chris pratt an eccentric gunfighter in the han solo mould who we meet stealing a metal orb coveted by the evil warlord ronan when he dispatches his top assassin the green skinned gamora zoe saldana to recover the artifact the pair find themselves locked up along with the galaxys most unlikely bounty hunters  a guntoting raccoon bradley cooper and his sidekick vin diesel who just happens to be a walking tree all the actors do a great job at portraying there characters they feel real beings you get to know about them and their struggles and you become attached to them every character in the movie got their time to shine especially rocket raccoon who is voiced perfectly by bradley cooper everyone is pitch perfect in their roles even batista for those that want specifics effects were top notch acting was excellent story lines were compelling the comedy was perfect 995% of the time and surprise there were a lot of one line typical superhero zingers that worked really well what really cant be stressed enough is just how insanely fun and entertaining guardians of the galaxy is for literally its entire twohourplus runtime i still have a hard time wrestling with who was my favorite actor in this all in all the film is brilliantly well done action scenes are engrossing and genuinely done you genuinely worry about certain characters and i for one was thrilled with it go see thisguardians of the galaxy is nothing short of an amazing movie if theres anything i can say its that it is the best superhero movie i have seen not only does it have the

so when i went to the harkins theatres i didnt even know what this movie was about or what to expect since im not a marvel geek however i always loved movies taking place in the galaxy and stuff like that so i went to see gotg one word  phenomenal absolutely amazing its been such a long time since i had so much fun watching a movie the first scenes were pretty sad and moving but after that  it was a super fun ride this movie is packed with action and comedy ive got to say there was not a single moment that i would get bored 1010 is my rating because thats how much i loved it  definitely the best movie for the summer of 2014 i absolutely recommend it to everyone greatest super hero movie of all time. one of the top crime dramas of all time. greatest heath ledger performance. heath will win the oscar just like the golden globe. nolan has made batman. if you didnt get a chance to see this in imax when it was out now is the time with the re-release. this movie is amazing in imax. the opening scene is entirely in imax and any time you see a city shot as well. also the great chase scenes are done in the imax. this must be up there with most reviewed films of all time but hey..... its that good. seriously if you havent seen this by now shame on you  he swore the script was the best she had ever read and that shed be perfect for the non-existent part of hayworth. 6. it was filmed in ohio although the film is set in maine the ohio state reformatory in mansfield ohio stood in for shawshank prison. the structure was slated to be torn down but the production delayed the demolition for a year. after the film wrapped all the buildings in the complex were torn down except the cell block and main administrative building which were preserved for historical purposes. 7. morgan freeman got really good at catch the scene where andy first approaches red about the rock hammer as red plays catch in the main yard took nine hours to shoot. freeman continued to play catch for the whole nine hours without complaining and showed up the next day with his arm in a sling. 8. the film was inspired by goodfellas darabont says his main source of inspiration was martin scorseses goodfellas because of its use of voice-over narration and editing techniques. 9. voiceovers are tricky business originally all of morgan freemans voice-over was recorded before any of the film was shot. the fact that much of it syncs up to the on screen action see: the scene on the roof where the inmates drink beer isnt simple editing. darabont would playback the recorded voice-over on-set during each take for the actors to specifically play off of the audio. but the audio quality of his voice-over was too poor to include in the movie due to tape hiss so freeman had to re-record the entire voice-over in post-production. 10. they got lucky with one of the most famous scenes every take of the films signature shot of tim robbins raising his arms outstretched in the rain after andy breaks out of prison was out of focus except the one in the film. it was the final take shot for that scene. 11. the prop guy was a jokester the visual joke of andys rock hammer being tucked into the bible right after the first page of the book of exodus came from the films prop master tom shaw. 12. none of the close-up shots of andys hands or feet are tim robbins theyre director frank darabont. 13. stephen kings red was changed for the film in the original novella red is described as a middle-aged irishman. 14. the mug shot of young red isnt morgan freeman its actually a photo of his son. 15. the tree where red finds andys letter isnt in fort hancock texas its in ohios malabar farm state park. greatest fantasy movie of all time. i have watched it at least 63 times and cant get enough best movie of all time 10 out of 10. the movie is a masterpiece made by a master of film. the only bad thing about this film is that it does not go for long enough..... 3 hours is to short for a movie. my favorite character was aragon because he is the definition of badass. legolas was also badass but gimli was lacking in badassness but that is was defined the characters. peter jacksons sneaky cameo appearances in these movies were also another highlight of the best trilogy of all time. overall i rate this movie a 10 out of 10. if you have not watched this movie then i spit in your general direction i like turtles. #halamadridgreat music superb actors. it is a pity that forrest gump which i consider another masterpiece  went out the same year and got all the publicity as well as the oscars. it was not fair. the only reason for which i rented this movie two years ago was because of morgan freeman and tim robbins. but it was a big surprise to see one of the best films ever made.  i have seen it 6 more times since then  it is a story of courage perseverance true friendship hope and redemption. its a movie for all times a memorable one. everybody should see it. yoÍ_ wont regret.great movie. a mustsee for everyone. the script the acting the directing... its all topnotch. i can give a detailed review but it wont help you. you gotta enjoy this one yourself without any details told.great movie the most amazing batman film ever. after seeing this movie i was left speechless. the performances from every actor and actress was amazing. just an excellent film.............. a must movie to see it has action. it has laughs. it has humor. it has non stop one liners from the joker.if any movie has deserved a perfect 10 this would be it. excellent work thanks for that. the most amazing batman film ever. after seeing this movie i was left speechless. the performances from every actor and actress was amazing.great movie it really expands from batman begins. i know that there has been a huge controversial topic when the movie first came out but christian bales voice as batman was amazing. it really differentiates these films from the other batman films. its something people would do to hide their identity. anyone would recognize you from your voice if they know you. heath ledgers performance is absolutely amazing and it saddens me dearly that hes gone. especially at such a young age. the dark knight trilogy has become my all time favourite in the live action films of the comic book world and i hope that other movies that dc produces will follow. ultimately christopher nolan has done an amazing job and with an amazing cast it became a huge impact on the way people see batman. great movie deserves huge amounts of creditgreat move. although the movie was slightly different than the book itself. the special effects and the intensity of the characters were remarkable. i would recommend this movie to all my friends. the movie got better and better since the 1st part. i have watched part 2 about 10x and will do the same with the 3rd. i hope they come up with the trilogy to buy it all at the same time.great film exposing quentin tarantinos expert directing talents and an all-star cast of brilliance the use of chronological order is perfect able to be understood by a wide range of viewers my favourite scene being when butchin car sees marsellus on the crossing and if youve seen the film the rest til the bit after the shop minus the violation youll understandgranted i heard terrible things about this film before i saw it on video after watching this film several times i got the plot but i also get a little more each time i love watching dame vanessa redgrave as a female criminal mastermind in this role i also enjoyed a bit known actor rolf saxon an american expatriate living in london as william donloe remember hes the poor sucker that gets the blame for a breaking an entry that caught him off guard i like rolf saxon as the gullible american in this film hes the best part of the film in my opinion and the surprise to me since i became a fan of his in 1994 after watching old capital city episodes i believe did his job extremely well and deserved to be listed in both beginning and ending credits of the film i love john voight and cant imagine why angelina jolie doesnt want much to do with him i felt tom cruise was adequate i like vingt rhames and henry czerny in the their roles i forget the french actress who was voights wife thats too crazy to believe i thought that kristin scottthomas and emilio estevez deserved more time on screen but thats the movie for you i loved the prague setting virginia countryside and london as wellgone girl two words epic win david fincher just won film making hands down awesome story film acting soundtrack everything need a horror? here need a suspenseful plot that blows your mind? here need a love story that you simply adore? yep here and no this isnt a date night film or is it? the psychological seduction here was wonderful you get to see the situation from several perspectives as the film progresses and you cant stop second guessing what will happen next on occasion even whats actually happening now my wife and i cant stop talking about this film were trying to watch the daily show after returning from the theater and everything literally everything is just tuned out after that film so much to talk about so many spoilers but i wont i cant ill simply say this film was fantastic just ride it out if it doesnt grab you in the first thirty minutes by an hour in youll be helpless to do anything but continue and its sooooo tasty its such a delightful plate of betrayal seduction revenge conspiracy and humanity at its best and worst unlike every other film that came out in 2014 this one will stay with me for far too many reasons the biggest being this could actually happen which makes it far more frightening and closer to home it also makes you think about how easily truth can be distorted and more to the point wonder what the average person is willing to do to get what they want from life smiles 10 out of 10 amazing film a perfectly crafted movie for people who love good moviesgone girl review 1010 oh my god janice from friends this movie was amazing gone girl is directed by david fincher and stars ben affleck rosamund pike neil patrick harris and tyler perry? ben affleck stars as nick dunne a man whose wife goes missing on the anniversary of their wedding and i wont say anything more because the best way to watch it is to not know anything i will say right now thisisawesome first david fincher fincher is one of if not the best director working todayall time i can not put to words how much i love finchers movies i mean se7en zodiac fight club the social network look at that list of movies come on but enough about fincher how about rosamund pike and we will get to ben affleck but to me she was the best part of the movie even beating out affleck she will and should win best actress for the oscars this year she is just great in this role and from what i have read of the book 20 pages she fits the character very well now ben affleck i unlike some people have always loved ben affleck especially now in his career with some of his recent films directing with gone baby gone the town and argo and acting with those same movies and now this i think peoples opinions of will change next our supporting actors neil patrick harris and tyler perry first neil patrick harris i personally am a big fan of his and himym but i dont think he really fits into the movie his character couldve been played better by someone else doesnt take away from my enjoyment of the film now tyler perry what the fgone girl marks finchers tenth feature film and his most mature work since fight club centering on nick dunne a husband desperately trying to find his wife all while having police and media accuse him of murder the story sounds straight out of the scott peterson case and the film looks unlike any film ive seen in recent years lead by an all star cast featuring ben affleck rosamund pike tyler perry and neil patrick harris gone girl rises above the pack with smart storytelling phenomenal pacing and perfect performances what gone girl does so brilliantly is taps into the audiences psyche regarding marriage and the ideology behind a sanctioned union that is corrupt it is really heavy stuff when the story really gets to the meat and bones of it all with plenty of twists and turns gone girl keeps you not only second guessing the whole idea of marriage but the intentions of every character in the film it is truly one of the most twisted films adapted from an even sicker and twisted book thats out there right now gillian flynn does wonders with her adaption from her own novel the dialog is crisp the characters are multilayered it truly is a pitch perfect script that doesnt have one false moment in it ben affleck and rosamund pike are excellent in this film this is a different affleck a very human and realized affleck nick dunne is a wonderful role for him and captivates just how good he can be with a terrific director harris and perry give well rounded performances as well but are nothing compared to affleck and pike david fincher and his long time collaborator and cinematographer jeff cronenweth create a dreary horrific tone for gone girl that makes every twist and turn that much more gut wrenching every shot is meticulously planned showing each shot as if it were a still frame that spoke a thousand words it is truly gorgeous filmmaking and now for the trent reznor and atticus finch deliver a perfect  besting their social network and girl with the dragon tattoo  if reznor won for social network i fully expect not only a nomination but a win for this film overall this is a mesmerizing film that demands multiple viewings to truly get the full experience it is impeccably made beautifully acted and an all around near perfect filmgone girl is the most exciting thriller ive seen in a long time ill be shocked if it doesnt end up my 2014 top 10 list before you go see this one you better apply ample amounts of deodorant because it is the kind of movie that will shake you and make you sweat a lot it begins on a strange evening nick ben affleck and his wife amy rosamund pike are celebrating their 5th wedding anniversary but when nick gets home his wife is not there the front door is open and there are signs of a struggle inside in the ensuing media frenzy the public fall in love with amy and everyone frantically searches for her with all eyes turned towards him nick begins acting suspiciously or at least not the way that the media thinks he should be acting the media turns on him in an ever increasingly torturous descent filled with devastating revelations gone girl is filled with so many twists and turns that im not going to be able to tell you much about the plot but i can tell you what my viewing experience was like imagine that you are walking down a dark alley in a seedy part of town you see someone hurriedly running through out of their pocket a ticket falls out you pick it up and on it reads the most dazzling show on earth unforgettable it will shake you to your core you notice the price on the ticket reads $100 and that the show is nearby you yell out to the stranger but they are already long gone so go take a look inside is a massive amphitheater but only a few people are attending none are in the front row and everyone seems to be keeping to themselves you sit down and notice that the stage is set up like a magic show a nervouslooking man enters fitted with a straight jacket and led by a beautiful femmefatalelooking assistant he is thrown headfirst through three rings of fire and into a glass coffin the coffin is slowly being filled with acid while walls adorned with spikes begin closing in youre awfully excited to see how this guy is going to get out of it when you hear a bloodcurdling scream in the row behind you someone has fainted you ask yourself why a show this grandiose and elaborate isnt being attended by more people then it dawns on you that maybe theres a reason that guy in the alley was running so quickly maybe the gentleman who has been thrown into a seemingly escapeproof solution isnt meant to escape at all thats what this movie is like its a nightmare that scares you but is addictive so you cant turn away you see our main character getting into a situation that just keeps getting worse and worse sometimes its his own fault sometimes it isnt it would be a dreadful depressing experience if it wasnt for two things the first is that there is a way out of this or at least in theory there is you dont quite understand what happened here but you know that its only a matter of time before this whole thing blows over and our hero sets the record straight right? the second is the mystery what did happen? where did amy go? what part did nick have in her disappearance if any? who is responsible and why? as the film plays out you will be treated to one devastating and headspinning revelation after another every time you think you have something figured out a new wrench is thrown in the mechanism and it begins to crumble all over again to give it a whole new level of intensity the film is incredibly realistic and airtight in its developments the characters feel genuine and have real depth to them the moments of incredible tension are often broken by moments of nervous laughter as the characters involved try to steel themselves against this nightmare they have found themselves in the script and the story are razorsharp in their wit and intelligence gillian flynn the author of the novel did an incredible job as an added bonus the performances are super intense i have unfortunately come to associate tyler perry with wooden performances unless hes in a dress but he is very good in this film everyone is really good in this film in fact you will see the cast list at the beginning of the movie and you will barely be able to recognize some of the actors because the roles and performances they are showing off here are unlike anything youve seen before i also really admire the  by trent reznor and atticus ross who did a terrific job in david finchers girl with the dragon tattoo and once again amplify the eerie and tense atmosphere of the film without distracting you from the action or resorting to cheap musical cues this film lasts over two hours and it left me wanting more i didnt see the time fly by at all because it is never slow in fact it only gets more intense as the minutes tick by and that ending absolutely perfect i was all sweaty nervous and fearful when i left the theater even though i had a friend to reassure me that everything was going to be perfectly safe i dont know what else i can tell you about this film i give it my highest recommendation there is a reason why every time i went to check this one out at the theater it was full to the brim this time i decided to bite the bullet and grab some crappy seats near the front just so i could finally see it it was worth it gone girl is so intense that i absolutely have to watch it again and soon theatrical version on the big screen october 18 2014gone girl is fascinating and an interesting and amusing take on a dysfunctional marriage arent all marriages dysfunctional? i would rather recommend that one should not approach the movie as a mystery suspense or thriller movie because that is secondary the real story is the functioning of a couple the real genre is the marriage when two people passionately in love come together to tie the knot and say their till death do us part what happens? are those fairy tales we watch real? do we all live happily ever after? the brilliance of the movie lies in its surreal story that is told in an unambiguous definitive way there is not a shadow of doubt to as what happened in the movie but the story itself comes somewhere from the dark recesses of the emotional labyrinthine a thought we dared not to think an idea killed at its inception that is what gone girl does and that is exactly what fincher loves to do tap the darkness but its darkness is also why sometimes movie indulges in excesses it is as if fincher just couldnt get enough of it and overdoes it like a child bestowed with the toys he had wanted all along fincher just couldnt let it go also up to three fourths of the movie the scale seems to be nicely balanced between rosamund pike and ben affleck but after that ben affleck seems like a victim and the wife as the abuser which many may think to be misogynistic in portrayal but for me it was just unfair and a blot in otherwise a brilliant take on marriage in spite of these flaws gone girl is a fantastic movie gone girl ridicules the notion of true love set by the standards of our happily ever afters and the happiness in marriage that this society preaches our insatiable diet for the happily ever afters but then the movie also talks about the beauty of it as both confess they bring out the best of each other and it is what makes it so twisted and self destructive a deal with the devil apart from love and marriage the movie also sets out to give light to the illusory nature of perception propagandized by the media the movie in the first half is itself ripe of manipulation and debauchery feeding off the ideas that we are too eager and judgemental to make and how fincher mocks at us brilliantly acted by rosamund pike with an able support from ben affleck and rest of the cast it is a must watch i loved it and the ending was perfect any other ending would have just spoiled the whole movie for me for me the blood stained rosamund pike in the arms of ben affleck with affleck whispering bitch in her ears while the crowd applauds true love will remain the most iconic romantic scene ever that scene in itself is an antithesis to all those stories of soul mates and happily ever afters a necessary antidote to our misplaced modern lovegone girl is fantastic there i said it its one of the most thrilling american movies ive seen in the past five years however i cant say im surprised david fincher is known for bringing us milestones in cinema being responsible for classics such as fight club and seven and you can easily add his latest film to the long list of spellbinding and transfixing movies hes been a part of not only is it a genius piece of art but its daring in its storytelling especially considering how wide of an audience the film has set in a small missouri town it centers around nick dunne ben affleck a man who may or may not have killed his wife at least thats what everyones trying to figure out his wife goes missing hes suspected and we watch things unravel from there its riveting strangely creepy at times and isnt afraid to show sexuality which most mainstream films are too afraid to touch not to mention the exceptional performances from the whole cast mainly our two leads affleck and rosamund pike but also from other standouts like tyler perry and kim dickens one of my favorite aspects was the little splices of comedy that seemed to break up the more tense moments showing how impeccable the writing is and you when you couple that with the beautiful cinematography you have a near perfect film i urge you to the see this it may split audiences but i enjoyed it endlessly and cant wait to see it again its a prime example of what cinema can and should begone girl is directed by the mastermind of david fincher amazingly written by gillian flynn whom wrote the novel the film is based on starring ben affleck as nick dunne and rosamund pike as amy elliot dunne on the day of their 5th wedding anniversary nicks wife amy disappears out of nowhere and this crazy intense and haunting journey begins david fincher and gillian flynns intelligent storytelling trough out this fantastic journey will keep at the edge of your seat from start to end the soundtrack and  is also very intense and haunting and has huge impact on the film the performances from all the actors especially rosamund pike are top notch which really helps the element of the realism stand out in this film gone girl is easily the best film i have seen this year so far and i have to give it a 1010 it is also one of the best films from david fincher in my opinion i strongly advice everyone to go and see gone girl it is one thrilling ridegone girl is a very dark mystery film it has all of the elements of a who done it story however this film has a twist the film has a big twist when the twist happens the film switches gears the film is about two and a half hours long but that doesnt matter when i watch the film i feel like time flys and im left wanting more thats a good thing the film is extremely fast paced so youre going to have to keep up i truly believe that this film deserves at least three viewings for someone to really enjoy it if you watch this movie again and again then youll pick up on things that you didnt know were there the  to this amazing film is eerie and also haunting i feel like the music really blends in well with the story and scenes being played out on screen the performances in this film are a mixed bag i feel like ben affleck does his job but he doesnt give a oscar worthy performance i also feel that all of the other actors in the film only did their jobs however rosamund pike knocks it out of the park im glad rosamund is nominated for a academy award in my personal opinion rosamund pike out acts everyone in this movie this is rosamund pikes movie rosamund is a rising star i hope she continues to get roles as juicy as her role in gone girl the film is full of twist and turns and i dont think youre ever going to guess what happens next this isnt your typical who done it movie this isnt your typical mystery thriller in my personal opinion this is director david finchers best work since seven if you really want to be entertained if you really want to be on the edge of your seat and if you really want to watch a film that will shock you then i highly recommend gone girl for anyone who likes to be surprisedgone girl is a tour de force of modern cinema it combines that best of both worlds those worlds being 90s fincher and 2000s fincher it has the intricate multiperspective narrative of the social network the interplay of media and crime reminiscent of zodiac the playful surrealism of the game the brash blood and gore of se7en and of course like fight club it had that indefatigable story twisting and turning at every point imaginable and taking the audience on an unforgettable cinematic experience it was particularly joyful to see such well written female characters the centerpiece being amy dunne played by the hollywood newcomer rosamund pike like an amoral lisabeth salander amy presents a terrifying image of female vengeance it was good to see a filmmaker known for his sausagefest films expand to include a more balanced cast where women arent reduced to sexual objects im looking at you the social network i hope this marks a new era of fincher one which balances intelligent sophisticated filmmaking with loads and loads of dark twisted fun 1010gone girl could be the best film so far this year but viewer discretion is defiantly advised the film follows nick and amy dunn a newly wed couple settling into life in missouri but it that all changes when amy goes missing the entire country jumps on board to try and help find amy and slowly everyone starts turning on nick the back nice guy that is pretty oblivious to everything around him but if you think you have this movie figured out think again the good stuff its directed by david fincher one of the most ambitious dark directors of the modern age and hes done it again the script is very tightly written movies based on books tend to either flop or are critically praised but when you have the author of the book writing the screenplay not much can go wrong the dark humor that is sprinkled in is perfect for the scenes that its used in and is often hilarious the film has a mood surrounding it that is unlike any movie you will ever see through out you are at the edge of your seat yet also constantly looking behind you as a deeply unsettling feeling creeps over your body this is in large part thanks to the performances by the leads ben affleck and rosamund pike are so terrific in there roles as well as just about everyone else the bad stuff well like i said there isnt to much that can go wrong when the books author is on board helping write there is really only one thing that i didnt like in this film near the beginning there was a lot of nudity now dont get me wrong im ok with it as long as it helps to obtain what the film is going for which closer to the end its used perfectly but the nudity at the beginning feels completely unnecessary and forced and there wasnt much shortage of it either the verdict gone girl is without a doubt one of the best films of the year featuring outstanding acting superb writing and just an overall mood to it that is unlike anything in film but some of the nudity took me out of the movie because of how forced it feltgone girl begins slowly with a lot of questions and clues and progressively ramps up until it grabs a hold of you and doesnt let go this is not the first glowing review for gone girl nor will it be the last its an odd mix of thriller mystery and drama with enough giggleworthy dialogue thrown into it to make it truly unique it is gripping from the very beginning and hangs on to your attention until the credits roll gone girls running time is 2 hours and 29 minutes but it never feels forced or dragged out in fact the only disappointment was that it ended at all aside from affleck who is perfect in his role of the lost husband making all the wrong moves in the ensuing media storm the cast of females in the film is what gives it its punch rosamund pike is truly amazing and saying anything else beyond that would be giving too much away it is a film that relies on suspense and genuine shock so providing any more details in a review would be a disservice supporting actress carrie coon takes on the role as the bold tellitlikeitis twin sister margo and kim dickens is the bright lead detective assigned to the case both are very compelling and often funny as nick slowly pieces everything together surrounding his wifes sudden disappearance the movie is based on a best selling novel of the same name by gillian flynn and one can only imagine how good the book is based on the success and reception of the film so far given the detail in the movie its hard to believe there could be more to the story that just didnt make the cut the instant buzzing of discussion and the looks of pure astonishment and joy on the faces of the moviegoers once gone girl ended said it all its still early with oscar season right around the corner but this is easily the best movie of the year so fargone girl based on the criticallyacclaimed best selling novel of the same name by gillian flynn here we have a thrilling engaging picture that will keep you constantly doubting yourself just when you think youve sussed it out the story for those that havent read the book revolves around the disappearance of nicks ben afflecks wife amy with rosamund pike playing the titular role split into a solid three acts each one will have you confused  in a good way  more than the last with you either rooting team nick or team amy for who you think is in the right  or the wrong some powerful narrative is provided by pike which only aids in the deep story and gives insight into the characters inner thoughts at two and a half hours long its a lengthy sitter but being so engrossed in the film as you are you will hardly notice so an achey bum shouldnt be a worry each member of the cast are fantastic in their roles especially praising pike who  really stealing the show  convincingly shows us her idea of crazy bitch wife brilliant none the less neil patrick harris of how i met your mother fame also gives a great side performance as illfated creepy stalking ex desi this has to be one of if not the film of the year no fantasy no science fiction this is something that could happen which makes it all the more compelling david fincher  director of oscar winners the social network the curious case of benjamin button and nominee fight club  adds another picture to his impressive portfolio and with it a sure best picture winnergone girl 2014 directed by david fincher i have been waiting for this movie for some time now being a david fincher fan and all and boy i wasnt disappointed ben affleck stars as nick dunn a writer that one certain night falls in love amy elliot played beautifully by rosamund pike it begins pretty well the love flows between the two however as time passes love fades away five years after originally meeting nick comes home to see that his wife disappeared from here on out the media begins to blame nick for the disappearance this is a great movie everyone on screen feels well placed however i dont think neil patrick harris was the best choice for his character he is by far the weakest point of the movie although tyler perry is great absolutely amazing choice the cinematography is wonderful youve come to expect that from a fincher film the  does justice to the experience and the screenplay done by the very author of the book it is based on is in fact fantastic it keeps getting darker and darker and well you got the point the movie is fantastic the weakest thing i can think of it is neal patrick harris castinggeoffrey chaucers canterbury tales was a frame story: there was one overall story/link that binded all the characters they met at the inn on the road which is at the beginning and end of the story but in between are mini-stories about each of the travellers. pulp fiction is a modern version. the frame in this case is the diner which is where like chaucers inn the main characters meet. in between we get mini-storys like butchs tale the knight if you will vincents tale the sailor and jules tale the monk. each is interwoven with the other except that chronologically they are out of synch butch wastes vincent in his tale but vincent is in the diner frame part of the story. the dialog is sharp and has some serious hidden meanings at times--tarintino is notorious like stephen king for lacing the dialog with pop-culture references. witness the scene outside jack rabbit slims where mia asks vincent youre not a square daddy-o are you and proceeds to draw a square in the air ala pebbles flintstone. this blurring of the films reality with our reality lets you know tarintino is not some by the books director with no sense of what joe bagofdonuts does--he watches tv too kevin williamsons re-writing of the horror film rules owes alot to pulp fiction and its acknowledgement of just who is going to see movies these days. rent it buy it... the bonus cut footage alone is worth a look.fyi: the following is my very first movie review. after watching the trilogy for 100 literally times that was kind of a vow i finally decided to write a review on it. the very first thing i noticed the first time i watched it was none i couldnt understand a word of it because my english was so bad and the picture was so blurry that might seem awkward but the dvd i got at that time wasnt original. it was actually filmed illegally in a movie theater by the way that is quite usual in my country. two years later i was a changed man. i became familiar with the imdb and developed a particular interest in movies in myself. in my journey through the top 250 list i gave the dark knight another try this time the dvd was genuine and it was unbelievable the movie i never respected was actually the best again literally movie i have ever seen first of all there was technically very little cgi and that is absolutely respectable and special for a superhero movie. secondly it really demonstrated the very nature soul and idea before all the superheroes: sometimes truth isnt good enough sometimes people deserve more sometimes they deserve to have their faith rewarded. we cannot live on our own we need and we deserve mythical superiors to help us. sometimes the truth is too unbearable that we have no other choice but to replace it misinterpret it with a myth a lie. the myth could be a god gods or even heroes: imaginary but inspiring. after all not to offend the ones who believe the god or gods is also made by the imagination of the man although the passing of time might make us to think that they are real but they are not. it is also noteworthy to understand the magnitude and the immortality of an idea and the trilogy represents this concept perfectly just like v for vendetta. last but not least it does not help to pretend that you are strong and it might even bring horrible harm to you. if the reality is too dark you just need to open the door and go outside.full disclosure ive read the book and think this is more than a cracking adaptation its a near total improvement across the board that said i became so caught up with the shape of the adaptation that a second viewing will better clarify the meanings at work what gone girl is about more than mystery misogyny money or any other mword if you think you have truth on your side youre clueless i spent so much of it grinning from ear to ear the humor is as pitch black as youve heard with one punchline near the end thats way too easy youll know it when you hear it but still finchers in fine form he and editor kirk baxter massage the 25 hour runtime into a steadily compelling thriller affleck and pike are both excellent each walking the emotional razors edge that fincher and writer flynn have established for them the script is a marvelous adaptation in the sense that it keeps so much of flynns original text and improving on it in more than a few cases still if theres a reason gone girl can occasionally strike its points a little too explicitly it can be linked to the script these instances are few and far between however the lasting impression of gone girl is that its a twisting and twisted popular entertainment likely to see few equals on american cineplex screens this yearfrom the beginning to the end this film is brilliant. the direction writing acting and music are all top rate and bring together a masterpiece of a film. the story-line does a fantastic job on reflecting the darker side of the batman comics but still brings across nolans own take on the characters as seen in batman begins 2005. this is my personal favourite of the the franchise and my favourite movie of all time and the fact that it has made its way into the imdb top ten reflects this opinion. i have enjoyed every christopher nolan movie i have seen and this is definitely his best. whether youre a batman fan or not. i highly recommend seeing this film. 10/10from start to finish this is a true masterpiece tarantino is a genius and it comes out in this film one of the most inspirational films going plus the only film that i seen which can make bruce willis into more of a bad ass this has some iconic scenes including when mia takes vincent to jack rabbit slim as well as amazing music vincent is funny and the only q i have is  is vincent dead or not epic this lead onto some other great films such as inglorious bastards  django and many other iconic tarantino films if you want a laugh then this film is for you  if you want a life changing experience this is for you an all star cast including  walken  plummer  roth  thurman  travolta and of course samuel l jacksonfrom start to finish i had nothing but fun with guardians of the galaxy it has one of the best soundtracks ive heard in a long time part of me cannot wait for the sequel just so i get to hear awesome mix vol 2 i can honestly say that i did not hate any of the characters which is very rare for me as their is usually at least one character that i just cannot bear to watch every character served their purpose and seemed necessary as soon as guardians of the galaxy becomes available on dvd i am sure it will very rarely see the inside of its case whilst in my housefrom my reading the books in school all the movies were kept as true as possible. and it was like following the books in synchro. the return of the king was the greatest movie of all time the beautiful land scapes and character builds kept me riveted through out the entire trilogy. peter jackson by far right now is quite possibly the most elite director to come to hollywood. he is now next to james cameron and also cecill b demile for oscar wins from a movie. gaining 11 wins with numerous other awards that has helped mold his career even more. this film is absolutely breath taking in scope as well as the deep camaraderie in the story line where not all soldiers are only made to fight. but they are made to understand life through combat. to see each others struggles and hopes and dreams nearly smashed by an ultimate evil. yet triumph through poise and audacity to look evil in the eye and come through with a friends life in one hand and a sword in the other. a true pinnacle in movie making.frankly speaking i am not a great fan of american comic book heroes. i think it is mainly because in india we have our own bunch of comic book super heroes. yes of course they havent made their entry to the big screen till now but we can expect few of them in the upcoming years. i am 22 and have my own stuff to do. thats the reason why i never get time for super hero fantasies. there are only two international super heroes that i like the most. one is batman and the other is spider man. one major reason due to which i like them is that they are practically vulnerable still fighting for the justice. i became the spider man fan after watching the 3 spider man films directed by sam raimi. and became a batman fan just after watching the dark knight. the plot the action sequences as well as the soundtrack... all were exceptionally well done. this is certainly the best superhero film ever made. he is not just a hero.... but he is more than that. most of the people believe that death is the ultimate sacrifice a superhero can make. but it is not true. few sacrifices are extreme than the death. this is what one can know about batman from this movie. for him concern for people was more important than his ego. thats the reason why he successfully protected the people of gotham from the masterstroke of a sociopath known only as the joker. in my viewpoint this is nolans best work till date and memento of course. watch this film... youll never regret it. while concluding my review i would like to share a list of top 10 movies with everyone. i am not saying this is a perfect list but these films can deliver you the best worth of your time and money. 1. rocky 1976 2. 12 angry men 1957 3. the dark knight 2008 4. its a wonderful life 1946 5. the godfather 1972 6. schindlers list 1993 7. citizen kane 1941/ the city of god 2002 8. the shawshank redemption 1994 9. american history x 1998 10. braveheart 1995forget these gentle little films like lost in translation or station agent -- this is what i call a real movie. it is outstanding in every way. while i felt the first two lotr films dragged and i couldnt get into them this final chapter kept my interest from the opening scene. truly spectacularforget the great things youve heard about the dark knight. no matter how lavish the praise or how determined the hyperbole its all understatement. the dark knight is i suppose the greatest superhero movie ever made but its so far beyond the limited men in tights genre that attempting to compare it with movies like spider-man superman or even batman begins is almost laughable. director christopher nolans film trumps everything and everyone including himself. its not just the best superhero movie ever made its one of the best movies ever to show up in a theater. more than a film about a man in a mask trying to stop the bad guy or save the innocent its the story of a city and its people trapped between an unstoppable force and an immovable object. gotham city is at the center of everything while two men each mad in their own way fight to control the hearts and minds of its populace. the joker heath ledger bursts onto the scene and correctly pronounces himself the living embodiment of chaos. this is a man who cares for nothing and wants nothing except to watch the world crumble around him. nolan wastes no time explaining jokers origin he is a force of nature and as such has always existed. faced with pure chaos given form the people of gotham turn to selfish terror and the joker laughs gleefully as we watch them dance to his tune. opposing him is batman christian bale embodying the pursuit of single-minded justice and hoping for the best in mankind he seeks to inspire them to something better through living symbols like gothams new district attorney harvey dent aaron eckhart or top cop lt. james gordon gary oldman. in the end it doesnt matter whether batman captures joker or joker takes out batman. what matters is which of them wins the battle for gotham citys soul. the genius of heath ledgers performance as joker is that in a way youll almost find yourself rooting for him to win. let him burn it down if only so we can see how hell make it happen. ledgers joker is easily the best on screen villain since star trek iis khan a performance unlike anything else youve seen. he is at once funny and terrifying. hell make you laugh at all the wrong moments and then cringe in unspeakable terror at all the others. his peals of laughter bounce through the film echoing long after the credits roll and leaving jokers mark not just on this movie but on cinema. hes an instant icon. the oscar buzz for what ledger has done is not premature. he drives the entire movie with his performance embodying something so out of control and his own way so true that the whirlwind of his mere presence destroys all comers. what im getting at here is that most of whats going on in the dark knight is mental. its not that there isnt action theres plenty of it but even when batman is running around punching people in the head or racing through the streets on his incredible visually stunning gadgets its the psychology of whats happening pushes the story. because of that the problems nolan had directing some of the action sequences in batman begins are utterly erased here. batman lurks in the shadows dispatching bad guys with a single punch. there are no extended complicated fight scenes for him to botch because quite frankly the movie doesnt need them. theres plenty of fighting but it happens in quick encounters staged one after another with a kind of lyrical precision i havent seen in anything outside of the action-poetry in last years the bourne ultimatum. when batman is forced into an extended showdown it takes the form of a brutal economical beating with punches landed with vicious force and battles being waged by men who have made themselves blunt instruments. what makes the action so arresting is the force of will behind it the philosophical battle driving it. youll be on the edge of your seat for every single moment whether its a simple conversation at bruce waynes office or a balls to the wall brawl inside a gangster-infested hong kong skyscraper.for years i have been hearing about this movie pulp fiction i would always hear about it see references to it and id ask people what the movie was about and none of them could explain so years pass and im scrolling through netflix i see pulp fiction and ive been a fan of quentin tarantino for a long time and his great works from inglorious basterds to kill bill so i start watching and from the first talk about robbing banks without robbing them and just the whole idea of it all made me wanna robs bank to without robbing it hahaha and you realize what makes this movie is what makes every tarentino movie and thats why i love his work the dialogue dialogue dialogue dialogue very movie is all about the plot just shoving and cramming the plot down your throat but tarantino can make a movie on how to bake cookies and itll be so good by diolague alone and now i understand why people couldnt explain it this movie really has no plot this movie is just about 3 interconnected events not in order one about a hit-man who gets more than he bargained for when he takes his bosses wife out on a date upon his bosss request 2 about a washed up boxer who makes a deal with the said hit-mans boss to fix a fight and screws him over which hints at the honor among thieves theme later that episode and lastly the hit-man and his partner accidentally kill their informant and have to get rid of the body  while it doesnt have the innocence of reservoir dogs or the maneuverability of the kill bill series it definitely stands on its own it is also one of the more charming and highly appealing of the generation x stoner flicks let me just say that if i could give this movie beyonder points id give it a 16 for eerily supernatural great great work for years batman fans and film fans alike had been waiting for the ultimate batman film a film that embodies everything about the character from the tragic story to the humane methods. christopher nolan finally gives the fans what they crave in this film right from the beginning the tension builds the action gets bolder and bolder the stakes get higher and higher there are pulsating battles there are heartbreaking losses. we get to see batmans fall from grace what it truly takes to try and save a city. spiderman 2 was previously the pinnacle of superhero films this film raises the bar even higher if only nolan would of given us a fourth entry to his series  darn what a good movie but i need to say this sometimes it happens.. so why do people love this movie and rate it high when or why isnt the smart people declare it like a a peace of art or do they still i think its darn good...but i bet the producers didnt expect that like when we vote for anything we need to follow our heart. this is a typical movie that is worth every penny every letter... and its a typical 90 movie oh.. there we have it between gone with the wind and now we need this love me as i am.. says the storyline in my head anyway. and i do yes i do for tom cruise fans and nonfans alike this wonderful thriller is so well crafted that it took my breath away many people even profession film critics didnt understand it perhaps it is too well written yes it is complex yes it is written for people with an attention span greater than a 3 year olds  you must pay attention but it does make sense every single second of the film is important director brian de palma gives us the unexpected at every turn his visuals as always are exciting the entire cast is fine but it is de palmas movie all the way one of the best films of the 90sfor those unfamiliar with writer/director quentin tarantinos cult masterpiece pulp fiction it is a twisted combination of plots that capture the very pulp of society that are evident in its title. the plot is a non-linear combination of three main stories that intertwine with the five main characters popping in and out of all of them. all three of the stories are very simplistic in theory and purposely made stereotypical by tarantino. however his goal was to take these classic mobster stories and add a twist to all of them. it is these aspects of tarantinos stories that change the formula from something generic and unoriginal to three of the most intense and memorable stories of film history. the glue that progresses and ties all of these stories together is the sharp natural dialogue that tarantino is so well known for. he is at the top of his game in pulp fiction providing the most natural and genuinely interesting dialogue that not only serves as something to listen to but also actually progresses the story just as much as the characters actions do. these actions are actually what the film is most criticized for with the movie being rated r for almost everything. some claim that the movie is just an excuse to set up extreme situations of violence and substance abuse. this has caused the film to be known for its excessive and brutal nature. however when paying closer attention it is quite easy to see that it is largely a story of redemption. since the film revolves around less than moral individuals it is not surprising to say that everyone who is killed in this movie could easily be considered a bad person but when examined one will notice that every character that seeks forgiveness for their actions is alive when the credits roll. the soupy morals and excessive nature are what this movie is known for. for good reasons too further supporting the choice for the title of the movie. however the reason this movie has reached a certain level of greatness over the years is not only from its drugs and violence but also from its tangled story superb dialogue. with pulp fiction being the masterpiece of a director as talented as quentin tarantino any movie fan owes it to themselves to see it.for those of us who have wondered if there will ever be an action thriller without the usual mixes seen over and over all these years yes this is the one do not wait to read till the end of my review go grab your tickets and watch it already in case you still havent throughout the movie pretty much only these happened with the audience in repetition laughing a lot wolfwhistling  clutching head a little bit of shock and lots of awe must mention  taron egertons jaw will make you swoon i guess it was so good thanks to that charming crisp script detailed character sketches incredible cast and and that bgm  and stunt sequence i should add a bit of the violence may not be well received but it is exactly that which makes it better for some of us this has easily got to be matthew vaughns best yet in fact the freshest new age action thriller in a long long time euphoric was how i felt in comparison other mass entertainers will fade in leaving that lasting feeling long after the movie gets over but not this one no as quoted several times throughout the 2 hour run time this aint that kind of moviefor the people who are not aware of the concept and the style that quentin tarantino uses for most of his movies tarantinos films involve a lot of blood violence strong language and profanity and most of his films are not told in a continuous manner they keep on switching between time periods like past and present tarantino takes his style and concept and pushes it to the absolute max in pulp fiction and this resulted in arguably the greatest film he ever made pulp fiction tells 3 different interrelated stories with one main character the first storys main protagonist is vincent john travolta the main protagonist of the second story is butch bruce willis and jules samuel l jackson is the main protagonist in the third with vincent playing a very strong supporting role the film also includes a prologue and epilogue and these stories are also shown non chronologically this film uses such a unique format that chronologically the events of the epilogue take place just moments after the prologue and the three stories told in the middle take place before or after the events of the prologue/epilogue pulp fiction is one of those films that would have perhaps not been as entertaining if it had been shown in a chronological order its non linear format of storytelling is definitely one of its highest points keeps the viewer thinking and interpreting this is a major benefit because the viewer can just choose to watch one story at the time and still be entertained and will still feel like that he watched a short flick and there will be a sense of completion all storys can also be re-watched chronologically to watch the film from a different perspective the film can also be re-watched in the current order it is in to comprehend the film in its entirety the films replay value is tremendously high i watched it around 10 times and always found it entertaining pulp fiction does not hold the viewer on the edge of his seat to find out what will happen next but to think about what transpired earlier and what led to the current situation for example: vincent and jules went to do their job all dressed sup in suits and couple of hours later they go to bar to meet their boss in shorts and t shirts at first i thought it was a glaring oversight but this is heavily explained later on and i was extremely surprised with the events that led to this sudden change of attire the films three stories are not that in depth or engaging neither is the overall plot of the film but the plot is still funny interesting and keeps us engaged throughout the three stories also inspired by short films that tarantino is a fan of brands that tarentino loves and b grade movies that tarentino likes they all appear this is a quentin tarantino movie through and through and his fingerprints are all over it he himself makes a cameo in this film and despite not being a trained actor does a decent job the dialogue is the films greatest point some really awesome fantastic and memorable dialogues are spoken throughout this entire film that they are being quoted to this very day this film does not want to directly take you into the action when vincent and jules first went to do their job they didnt get directly into they talked about a series of unrelated events which were all interesting to listen they are criminals about to commit a crime but to them it is just another day at work they are co workers and friends and they are gossiping another example is bruce betrayed marsellus wallace and killed someone he is on the run but decides to smoke in the hired cab and discuss with the taxi driver in detail about what he just did another example would be us bruce willis going around his houses yard rather than the film directly starting the scene with him entering through his houses front door in the yard scene the camera focuses closely behind butch to keep us on the edge of out seats and expect someone to attack him although nothing happens pulp fiction has many pop culture references and also involves some serious and controversial subjects likes miracles drugs mob bosses taking dives betting homosexuality rape all these subjects are depicted in the film the soundtrack and full length songs that are used are really good and just are fun to listen the main theme and ending themes are also excellent tracks the acting is fantastic samuel l jackson steals the show with his natural roles as jules john travolta regains his former glory and fame with his excellent performance as vincent uma thurman as mia wallace was also great and bruce willis is also portrays the butch character very well there are many awesome cameos throughout the film where the actors deliver their lines and perform their roles almost perfectly my favorite however must be christoper walkens short cameo and the sentimental story he tells about the golden watch all other minor characters like tim roth and amanda plummer also do a commendable job n their short roles in conclusion i want to say that pulp fiction is an astonishingly unique film which does not have a deep story and there is hardly any morale to the story but a tremendously entertaining film with a fun plot brilliant and absolutely mind blowing dialogue with tons of pop culture references and social commentary it is simple a masterpiece without a message and arguably quentin tarantinos best movie overall: 95/10for the past week id been pining to complete my rewatch of the lord of the rings 2001-2003 viewing the films for the first time in years. this wait however arduous was nothing compared to the 360 days i originally endured between the two towers 2002 and the return of the king 2003. the drought came to an end on december 26 2003: i remember the exact date because it was the first night of release and id been counting down for the past year. we bought our tickets weeks in advance waited in line for over an hour and my brother emptied a packet of jelly lollies over the row in front of us while trying to get the damn packet open. and so it is that peter jacksons trilogy-to-end-all-trilogies finally came to a close in truly spectacular fashion. with the armies of mordor marching on minas tirith gandalf ian mckellen and aragorn viggo mortensen must recruit the aid of alternative reinforcements if the land of gondor ruled by the callous steward denethor john noble is not to fall before the great eye of sauron. meanwhile this epic conflict is contrasted against the image of two little hobbits frodo and sam dutifully trundling across the wastelands of mordor two innocuous halflings carrying the weight of a million men. once again the film excels at these stunning contrasts. the death of denethor a powerful intimate moment of self-realisation unexpectedly bridges into the battle for minas tirith the loss of one man suddenly absorbed into the slaughter of thousands. a word of warning: arachnophobics should be weary of frodos excursion into shelobs lair a magnificent work of grotesquerie visual effects topped only by the insect pit in jacksons own king kong 2005. andy serkis as the computer-generated gollum once again brings pathos and fragility into the role of the tormented former ring-bearer. the return of the king has perhaps the most unforgettable final hour ive ever seen as the fate of all that is good comes down to a scrappy scuffle on the edge of a fiery precipice this one-on-one conflict somehow more epic than the entire battle of helms deep. but peter jackson isnt done yet. while excising tolkiens somewhat anti-climactic scouring of the shire he nevertheless brings the trilogy to a graceful and wonderfully satisfying close his leisurely winding-down approach doing justice to one of the richest fantasy sagas ever told.for the first time since its theater release i have just finished the lord of the rings trilogy. which is by far the greatest trilogy ever made. there were too many spectacular traits of this film that it was almost impossible to remember all of them. there was a terrific musical  epic battle scenes that last for about a 1 hour span time great characters and greatly succeeded on making you feel the worst of everything then comes back around for all hope to be regained. this is basically speaking upon the entire trilogy since it is pretty much one big film. it is completely understandable why this film won every single oscar for which it was nominated in but one thing that was wrong was that it wasnt nominated for enough things. this film should have been nominated and won all categories that it would be qualified for. there were amazing visual effects and spectacular set design. i was blown away by the fact that i thought such effects and designs could ever be achieved by anyone. there were no flaws in any part of the film no revealing mistakes and it was absolutely flawless. the characters in the return of the king were the same as always marvelous. there was a spectacular build up to feeling the proper emotions in which were meant to be shown and perfectly developed them in every way possible. there was hatred feelings and emotions attached to each character to feel everything that was meant to be felt. each actor was phenomenal in every aspect and seemed to be a perfect fit for everything. the greatest thing above all though was the epic tale. there were subplots that made the movie much more epic and entertaining than anything i have ever seen before. there were suspenseful moments with a giant tarantula attacking the characters battle scenes that last for a seemingly eternity and made you feel the very worst of everything that could happen. this truly is a masterpiece that can be seen over and over again but will keep you right where you sit and you will not leave your seat until the very end. despite its length it is still %100 worth the watch even the 4 1/2 hours extended cut needs to be seen.  or taj

marks a quantum leap in style control and story-telling bravado it remains a brilliant film only tarantinos second behind the cameras but still a strong contender for his best for a long time now i had seen this movie move up the imdb ladder and make its way to becoming #1 i was a bit irritated being that it took the spot of the godfather however this was before i had ever laid my eyes on even a trailer for this film so i researched through the credits and found out that it was based on a novel by one of my favorite writers stephen king i know what your thinking how could he be one of my favorite writers if i didnt even have a clue about this masterpiece. july 24 2010 was my movie day i promised myself i was going to stay up 24 hours watching some of my favorite films i started of at around 12:45 with the controversial sadistic genius masterpiece that is a clockwork orange then after my brain was through with ultra-violence i proceeded watching the best sequel ever made in the history of cinema the godfather part ii then after i felt like a corleone i started watching the coen brothers masterpiece no country for old men then after feeling lost i started watching pulp fiction and after that the time was around 4:30 p.m. and i broke my promise to myself and took what i thought was going to be a 2 hour nap which turned into a 6 hour intermission i woke up around 10:00 deciding which movie i was going to watch and i wanted it to be a classic i had never seen i was thinking 12 angry men but for some reason i wanted to see what the all this fuss was about when it came to shawkshank redemption so i rented it and started watching around 11:45 p.m. let me just say after this movie left an impact in my life and mind i now actually know why it is #1 on this site and it is for good reason this movie made me laugh hysterically at times like in animal house it made me think like fight club does at times it made me frightened like the shining at times and i have no other movie to reference my sobbing emotions with because no other film has made me cry and that should tell you that after a day of great films this one had the biggest impact on me.for a long time movies about super-heroes havent had much off an effect from regular movie going audiences aside from the people who have interest in it. but in the year 2008 super-hero movies not only got bigger but also better. it was with the release of the much acclaimed batman movie the dark knight which broke many box office records as well as earning two academy awards. so in knowing why its such a phenomenal film the dark knight succeeds from its great ensemble cast and screenplay. without a doubt the dark knight is largely a great movie due to its cast. just take a look at who all is in it. in his second turn as batman oscar-winner christian bale leads the cast while supporting roles come from other acting giants michael caine morgan freeman and gary oldman. although theres one role in particular that has become iconic in cinema heath ledgers posthumous oscar-winning role as the joker. for certain everyones good but heath ledgers performance is the most memorable. with the creepy facial tics sadistic sounding voice and devilish laughing it gets under your skin. in fact i remember watching the dark knight in theaters on its opening day seeing him sticking a knife in the mouth of a mob boss or with the scene where he sticks a pencil through someones eye socket i was on the edge of my seat. the joker that we see in the dark knight is probably the best movie-villain since hannibal lecter. even though the dark knight has a great movie villain christian bale also delivers the goods as batman. by now everyone knows the batman growl he does in the movie which has been referenced plenty of times in pop culture but one of the big reasons it works is the intimidation factor he brings. the voice sounds animal-like and combined with the imposing all-black costume youre able to buy that criminals would be afraid of him. bale also does the alter-ego bruce wayne with gravitas often sharing funny one-liners with morgan freeman and michael caine whore also of course great. also with scenes such as the one where hes mourning over the loss of rachel dawes were able to see a well-rounded performance coming out of him with action humor and drama. and of the actors who also were perfect in the movie are that of gary oldman as commissioner gordon and aaron eckhart as harvey dent/two-face. first off to any of you that have seen batman begins we can see how gordon has changed since that movie being a more tense and serious person than before and i cant help but feel as if oldman evokes al pacinos performance in heat another great movie but also there are the more sincere scenes he has. one in particular that usually gets to me is the one where he returns to his family who thought he was dead we really feel for the character as in the fact that he has to be constantly be surrounded by danger in his job but hes really doing it because hes a genuinely good person who want to protect and serve and oldman blends so well into it that he really becomes the character. then we have aaron eckhart playing harvey dent/two-face who almost in the end is the main protagonist in the movie as well as its tragic hero. as i read from the book the art and making of the dark knight trilogy chris nolan described heroes as characters that go through a major change and this is very essential to the origin of two-face and almost seamlessly eckhart really makes the character transformation buy-able. giving more strength to the already great movie is its screenplay penned by director christopher nolan and brother jonathon. since the dark knight is based off of the seventy-four year old comic book series batman theres a large canvas of source material to pull from. but rather than doing a straight on adaptation the nolan brothers add themes that parallel todays world as well as themes about moral choice. notably the theme of how society reacts to terrorist threats is smartly woven into the chaos the joker brings into gotham. as you see images of large buildings blowing up or batman standing with firefighters at a destroyed site its hard not to think about 9/11. how this affects the rest of the characters can be summed up with the word fear. we were afraid of the horrific event 9/11 and responded aggressively by declaring war on iraq similar to how batman jim gordon and district attorney harvey dent had an aggressive response to both the mob and the joker in trying to eradicate all crime in gotham. upon the terrorist themes in the movie the theme of moral choice is used to further show how these characters react to the joker. depicted in a scene where the joker has two ferries rigged with explosives he gives the passengers on both boats triggers to blow each other up and whoever used the trigger first would be the boat of the people who survive which as youd think puts these people at this near impossible choice of whether to save their own skins or let the other passengers live. if a scene such as that actually were to occur itd be fascinating to know how wed react to that but for a film based off of a comic book to do this is stunning. the dark knight is a movie that ascends preconceived notions of what a comic-book movie should be and holds its place in cinema as an astonishing achievement. aside from the oscars and praise it has gotten the film was able to take a childhood favorite character of everyone and present him in a mature context. altogether the dark knight is a phenomenally well-made film thats more than just entertaining.following several interlocked tales of criminals pulp fiction is about as well-written well-acted and well-directed as any film out there the first storyline centers around jules and vincent samuel l jackson john travolta who are sent to retrieve a briefcase for their boss marsellus wallace ving rhames the second story line focuses on vincent taking wallaces wife mia uma thurman to dinner and the final storyline is about wallace bribing a boxer named butch bruce willis to take the fall is a boxing match of course the story is extremely complicated and is not in chronological order but going through everything that happens would take a while tarantino won a best screenplay oscar but the movie should have won many more awards including best picture best director best supporting actor samuel l jackson and best supporting actress uma thurman in most years i would say that john travolta should have won the best actor oscar but i give the nod to tom hanks in forrest gump the acting nonetheless is still as good as you will find anywhere travolta jackson thurman willis rhames christopher walken tim roth amanda plummer harvy keitel and eric stoltz are all terrific the only sub par performance is that of tarantino himself the style of direction that tarantino uses is one of those love it or hate it kinds if you love few different camera shots and long focuses on a character then you will like tarantinos style of direction in conclusion pulp fiction is the best movie made in the 90s i was skeptical of the film at first with its long running time but after sitting through it there really is nothing in the film that is not necessary and that should be edited out this is a film that once you see you will want to watch over and over again that is the true sign of a masterpiecefollowing batman begins director christopher nolan continues the story of batman and gotham citys war on crime in the 2008 the dark knight. batman/bruce wayne christian bale along with lieutenant gordon gary oldman and new district attorney harvey dent aaron eckhart are eager to destroy gothams organized crime gangland. their attempts are quickly halted however when they cross the mastermind and commander of the criminal world the joker heath ledger. after being outwitted by the joker anarchy hits gotham batman full force. as if there were not enough chaos in bruce waynes life there was also the motif of the love triangle between batman harvey dent and rachel maggie gylienhaal bruce waynes long time love and childhood friend. while bruce wayne continues being batman and fighting crime there is no future for rachel and himself. while waiting for bruce to come back to her she finds herself falling in love with harvey dent who can provide her with the future that she desires. the love triangle between the three characters adds to the plot of the movie. another technique relevant to the theme of the movie is the use of the camera. during a few scenes with the joker the camera is used remarkably to intimidate viewers. in a particular scene where the joker is threatening rachels life by holding a knife to her head the camera focuses on them by blurring the other characters in the background. the result of this technique encouraged viewers to feel the same feeling of fear that rachel felt in that moment. throughout the movie the camera also shoots scenes that add to batmans character of being fearless and gallant. for example there is a shot of the tall building and the long drop that rachel is about to face. when she drops out of the window batman swoops out after her. the camera shot reflects how courageous batman is by showing the audience the risk he took. although maybe not quite as memorable as the dark knight batman begins continued the theme of good vs evil. the 2005 film was necessary in order to lead into the dark knight. and at the end of the dark knight nolan left viewers with questions to be answered and the need for a sequel. my personal review notes the many unexpected twists and surprises that keep viewers on the edge of their seats_„_.the scenes are vivid and picturesque_„_.and the shots are impressive and breathtaking from the beginning till the end. truly a movie made for high definition and for the big screen.  friendship despair hope redemption and happiness. the musical  is nothing short of fantastic and really elevates some of the more moving scenes in the film. firstly this film is about hope. andy is wrongly accused of murder and is sent to shawshank prison. he has no friends and is quickly picked on at arrival because of his quiet unassuming nature. but as time passes the other inmates begin to respect andy because he doesnt allow prison to break him. andy perseverance is so strong that it begins to rub off on the others. i think to really get this film you need to step away from the context of it just being a prison movie. you could say the prison is life. the warden and the guards are problems trials and troubles in life that can test and possible break you.no matter how bad things yet no matter what brutal things you have to endure youve gotta hold out hope you gotta hang on you have to believe youre gonna get through it. this is about the very nature of the human spirit told in a very simple straight forward way. this film is also about the power of friendship. i think hollywood seems to have a hard time portraying a meaningful male friendship and just resorts to endless buddy and stoner movies. shawshank does a great job of this. i felt this aspect of the film was told in 2 parallel stories. the first was the old librarian brooks. when he was released he struggled to adapt to the new world. as red says he had become institutionalized so much so that without shawshank he felt alone afraid and had no purpose. in the end it was just too much for him to bear. easily one of the more heartbreaking scenes in the film gets me every time. when red is released he faces the exact same challenges that brooks did. and he too struggled and almost lost hope. the only thing that kept him him going was his friendship with andy. as freeman narrates: theres a harsh truth to face. no way im gonna make it on the outside. all i do anymore is think of ways to break my parole so maybe theyd send me back. terrible thing to live in fear. brooks hatlen knew it. knew it all too well. all i want is to be back where things make sense. where i wont have to be afraid all the time. only one thing stops me. a promise i made to andy. it was literally the only thing he felt worth living for and a key part of the film i think people forget. and before andy left prison you could see how it deeply affected red. he had lost his friend and the heartbreak of it was written all over freemans face fantastic acting if you ask me  it was subtle quiet suffering. and finally the film is about redemption. some people feel the redemption is andys. but i believe that andy was just the agent of reds redemption. at the start of the film red was pretty much redesigned to life in prison. he had accepted that these were just the cards he was dealt and there was no real reason to feel otherwise  he had given up hope. the first few times he went for his parole hearing red was just going through the motions he was just saying what he thought he had to get to be let out. it was completely insincere. you can see an the film progresses andy changing red. theres a great scene where red mentions that he used to play the harmonica. andy gets him one as a present and later in a small but important scene red picks up the harmonica and he quietly plays a note. for me this is where red begins to believe again. but the key scene for me is the last parole hearing. red has been so affected by andy that for the first time he has a genuine moment of repentance where he honestly admits to his crime: theres not a day goes by i dont feel regret. not because im in here or because you think i should. i look back on the way i was then: a young stupid kid who committed that terrible crime. i want to talk to him. i want to try and talk some sense to him tell him the way things are. but i cant. that kids long gone and this old man is all thats left. i got to live with that. rehabilitated its just a bullshit word. so you go on and stamp your form sonny and stop wasting my time. because to tell you the truth i dont give a bleep. it really is just an incredible moving scene one of my all time favorites. red is completely broken and regretful its nothing short of movie magic. and the ending well lets just say it leaves me with a smile on my face. in my opinion this is the greatest film ever made. an incredibly powerful uplifting story. if you havent seen this you need to. http://andretms.blogspot.ca/  flat out the best movie ever from the opening everybody be cool this is a robbery scene - misirlou to the end of the story halfway through the film tarantino keeps you guessing and paying attention to the whole movie so that the ending is explained and might i mention the brilliant acting by: sam the man jackson john the comeback kid travolta harvey the wolf keitel quentin hey its my movie tarantino bruce zeds dead baby willis uma adrenaline thurman and ving im gonna git medieval on yo  rhames just to name a few christopher walkens speech is not to be missed hilarious humour voracious violence and a sizzling story make pulp fiction the best movie of all timefirst watched this movie only 3 months ago having been well acquainted with the grossly underrated bakshi version. i simply cannot put into words the sheer awesome epic-ness of this third instalment the lord of the rings film trilogy is one of the greatest achievements in filmmaking... peter jackson & co did an excellent job and should be immensely proud of themselves. stunning visuals a perfect  great acting memorable scenes and more. the film does deviate from the book a bit. why shelob couldnt have done what she did in ttt is beyond me. it could have shortened the running time a bit. ah yes the running time...my one gripe is the running time & multiple endings as others have pointed out. its a very long movie but i enjoyed every single second of it and i think it could not have been done better. simply epic 10.1/10first thought.....excellent work by christopher nolan and heath ledgerfeels bad to miss a great actor....this movie might be considered by masterpiece by manyincluding me and some people just give 1 rating because they dont accept it as the masterpiece....its ok but giving 1 rating is too harsh.... this is a kind of movie of movie that has something for every fans..its really a great thing to combine actionmessages to peopleentertainment and giving it in a fast paced way..there are lot of thoughts in each character batman - wants to save his city bruce wayne - using his resources to save the city jokerthe best - wants to prove the ugliness deep inside every human harvey dent - even the beast can go wrong gordon - a uncorrupted cop and a lot of good characters....if u r a casual watcher u will enjoy the movie...if u watch it deeply and closelyyou will feel the greatness in the movie...i watched the movie around 3 times....and every time i find something more interesting and deeper thought......hatz off nolan....no matter wat other users have to say....ill go with the the critics...its my favorite movie of my life time....first things first i am a huge lotr fan and a love all of them even the hobbit films. i have read all the books and they are one of my favorites as the hobbit is my favorite book of all time. lotr in general are my favorite movie franchise of all time. they all are so well written and directed but the best of them all in the lord of the rings films as i liked the desolation of smaug more by a hair is return of the king. return of the king had the best battle scenes and the best cinematography and acting in it although they were all well acted. return of the king to me had the best visual effects and the best bad ass parts. when eowyn and merry take down the witch king of angmar that was one of the best scenes in a movie ever. all in all i cant fathom the love and compassion that i have for this film if i could give it a 12 i would but alas i cant. return of the king is amazing. you have to watch all of them especially return of the king.first thing to review about the movie is the depth of acting by heath ledger as joker. the induction of terror and fear along with outstanding sound effects with hans zimmers ground breaking s. strong dialogues and well crafted dynamic direction of the movie creates an immense feel to the movie. batman costumes is having deeper feels and style. christian bale performs his class performance. the nolans representation of joker is not like the original animated series joker but far better scary and have a strong attitude. perfect villain for a perfect guardian. many scenes have a direct implication about overcoming the fear from within. which is truly motivating. use of many motivating quotes boost the value of the movie. we can get the feel of the strength and responsibilities of batman. strong emotional sense and decision making is well depicted towards the end of the movie. how the choices have different outcomes and what a hero means. sacrifice and fall of a super hero. a must watch in my opinion if u like action comics superheros etc. thank you.first off why batman begins is better than the dark knight. first reason is because of the gotham/batman feel to movie. christopher nolan definitely worked hard on a gotham city in batman begins with artdeco buildings but in the dark knight it is chicago and hong kong with all modern buildings. i recently went to chicago and found at least a dozen places that were clearly in the dark knight. also the bat cave is lost and so is wayne manor and i know they are both destroyed but at least in the third film they should bring those back. second reason is because there is a more variety of villains in bb and you feel like he is almost cleansing the city which he also does not yet succeed. you expect that in the dark knight but you get a lighter feeling rather than a dark cruel city that needs saving. filming mostly in the daytime really affected the film. also the only villain you get is the joker i guess two-face but you do not get them at once and he is just one person trying to make the city his. the villain is to clear you do not get a dark and confused world. in bb you have scarecrow victor zsaz ras al ghul carmine falconi and henri ducard. thridly i have heard that the reason if any why they did not like the dark knight is that there was too much action. the action scenes were not even memorable in terms of hand to hand combat which there were few of. all the training he got seemed to go to waste against the joker. now about the movie. this cast is also stacked like the dark knight. batman begins is a great and entertaining movie especially for the comic reader. i first saw the movie before i read comics and played video games on batman. watching it again i was blown away absolutely amazed about how much detailed was put into the movie  which the dark knigh lacked. this was christian bales best movie yet. for a third movie it would be awesome if they did not let go of the joker but instead get a heath ledger look alike to play various cut scenes of him escaping arkhum asylum and ruling gotham. this time it would be harder for batman to get to him because this time the riddler and the penguin are in his way. the riddler is forcefully employed by the joker and the penguin is persuaded. the riddler should be a jigsaw type character spying on batman and making him solve his riddles. the penguin on the other hand is almost tricked by fighting batman because he has started racketeering and business fraud which he come across wayne industries. the joker is ruling all of this. maybe a third villain would come in handy. also bring back the gotham look and it should be the start of the batman we all know the great detective and the dark knight. when he becomes batman instead of the bat-man. ***click yes*** ***please click yes***first off i wont urge you to go see the movie in fact dont go because if you hesitate and wait for some random dude on the

totally forgiven for the tdkr fiasco pps yeah im a nolan fanboy so what?first off i have a thing for movies regarding time travel and time related issues in general as well as being an avid space and scifi fan so perhaps i am a bit biased in that way nevertheless i had high expectations of this movie and it really exceeded those expectations in every way it literally blew me away the movie has a very high rate here at imdb rightly so in my opinion and while i see many positive reviews i also see quite a few digging it right into the ground claiming it is utter crap basically i do not understand those people to be honest though everyone is entitled to their own opinions of course this movie is perhaps different from a lot of other movies yes as it is not purely based on entertainment values eg shoot kill and laugh instead it requires a level of intellectual understanding maybe scifi to some but who says there are no additional dimensions which we have not discovered yet? reality check here if you had told people some 100 years ago we had men walking on the moon and that air travel would be a very common thing these days they would have thought we were crazy so try to think beyond the current human knowledge and youll understand that there is yet so much more for us to discover to explore interstallar deals with this perfectly and gracefully in my opinion and it is very correct in physical terms too eg no sounds are audible in space  when the explosion occurs fot me at least this is an excellent movie well worth its current rating and more than worth the one oscar it got if you are an avid scifi fan especially one who enjoys the deeper mystery stuff this is one movie not to missfirst of all this is probably the greatest superhero movie ever made. chris nolan out did himself on this one. from the acting to the action this movie is perfect. nolan does an excellent job in each of his batman films of encapsulating the essence of the caped crusader. and if the movie didnt have enough going for it before you factor in the joker and ledgers performance. this is honestly one of the greatest acting jobs i have seen in a film period. heath ledger effortlessly becomes mista j with his own twist. it is such a dark and convincingly terrifying portrayal of the joker it gives any view the chills. the dark knight is not only an amazing movie but quite possibly may go down as a top ten film in general when its all said and done.first of all things i should say i am a comic-book fan. from eastern europe. why is this important because here its something really different then in the usa. in the usa comic-books are part of the everyday life. here it is not. here it is an underrated genre and most of the people still think it is something sissy for small children and contains only fighting and dialogue no higher level then kapow and boom-boom. and it was even worse when i was little. it was always a little treasure hunt to get some. and most of them was bad rip-off cheap junk from the above mentioned category and it was only batman who continually represented quality and was available for a kid like me too. and i was amused and loved it. not batman in the first place but the amazing villains. and especially joker. he was the best of the best. maybe the most complex interesting and remarkable character ever created. and to tell the truth i wasnt entirely satisfied with either one of the batman films made up to the dark knight. especially considering that there was an absolutely brilliant animated series: batman the animated series check it out if you like batman well worth it. they first 3 movies were okay but the batman and robin and batman begins both sucked big time but for different reasons. i lost hope i will ever see a really good and faithful adaptation of this comic. then along came this one. yes it has some overdone parts some flaws here and there a bit rushed and corny ending but its good meaningful and heath ledger who i disliked before i saw this is the absolutely perfect joker. when i saw the casting i thought it is a disgrace. after i saw the movie i thought he was unearthly good. the film has suspense great acting emotions and a very interesting and coherent plot which is very rare in hollywood blockbusters. well worth watching for anyone and everyone. especially for people who think comic-books are sissy things for little children...first of all a great thanks peter jackson to make people to re-live tolkiens epic-lord of the rings trilogy. all the 3 three movies comes with a great cinematic experience an experience that rule the hearts of millions forever an experience that take you back to the middle earth. the direction of the the movie is perfect and the acting is treat to watch specially sean astinsam and viggo mortensenaragon. all technical aspects of the movie are good. the war scenes are so perfectly created that people will love to watch. although the movie is not as good as book but it is the best that can be created out of book and also you cant expect everything in 200 mins movie.finally after a series of magical books by j.r.r. tolkien and after the first two movies in a series that redefined cinema the lord of the rings series finally comes to a close with the return of the king. im so pleased to be saying the following words. this movie is not just the best in this magical series but its also mostly one of the greatest movies ever made on screen. the final story picks up where the two towers left off where frodo and sam are still traveling to mordor while gollum might set them in a trap to capture the ring at last. then gandalf and the gang are still trying to defeat the wrath of sauron and finally be able to destroy this deadly ring. thanks to the incredible masterful directing by peter jackson and thousands of artists and technicians they all help us dig deeper into this magical world that only at the movies we can be able to escape to. the performances are just brilliant and electrifying to watch on screen. elijah wood and sean astin are just brilliant continuing their roles as frodo and sam and they still have a lot of heart and soul into their on-screen friendship. ian mckellen and viggo mortensen improves once again with fine and brilliant performances. but out of all that its andy serkis that should have received a best supporting actor nomination in 2003 for his work as gollum. serkis has portrayed such a brilliant character and the visual enhancements made to create him was all quite super. from an opening flashback involving smeagol a.k.a. gollum thats super thrilling to a final setback gollum is by far the best character in this movie. although this movie is set during a long 200 minute run-time i was just distracted for what this movie had to offer that i didnt care about how long it was. it has everything youd expect to see. its got heartbreak action comedy drama fantasy and magic. the special effects are exhilarating from beginning to end and it made me wanting for more. the beautiful art direction and costumes made me feel like i escaped to a more beautiful place. the cinematography is challenging in such perfection and the original  is really with a treat. i also adored the wonderful sound effects and the memorable film editing. the love stories are touching the friendship scenes are heartwarming the fight scenes are groundbreaking and the finale blends with a perfect mix of heartbreak and hope. i could tell you a thousand reasons why this movie is excellent. this is a movie that loves movies. its a movie that keeps you wanting for more. all this movie needed was a talented director a brilliant cast groundbreaking special effects incredible art direction amazing music and an inspirational storyline. this is such a crowning achievement in cinema. its one of my all-time favorite movies and im glad this movie won the best picture oscar in 2003. lotr: the return of the king in my review an epic and groundbreaking cinematic masterpiece.film director nolan really is crossed with this  i work one teacher nail batman saga that hardly could be overcome. great performance bale but especially was ledger performance awesome acting taught her role  sin being doubt the best joker ever. both the script as the directorate of film were majestic . the a taste mas i was watching a un batman find complexed sin power solution a  a dark film big labor . the solo movie unos has small minor mistakes that almost pass unnoticed. bale is a sin to doubt my favorite actor nolan has earned my his work favoritism for large esta saga but especially for the part ii what is this. i say goodbye and thanking the work done that the great cast create esta could work together .fear can hold you prisoner. hope can set you free _„_ these words inscribed on the poster of the shawshank redemption sum up whats at stake in frank darabonts chef-doeuvre. the shawshank redemption shows us that there is hope even within the restricted walls of a prison. andy dufresne tim robbinsis a prominent banker wrongly convicted of killing his wife and her paramour who spends many years in the shawshank prison. he forges an unforgettable friendship with red morgan freeman a veteran of the penal system who helps him to cope with the frightening realities of prison life. while the prison walls shield red and the other prisoners from the depredations of an ever-changing world it has the exact opposite effect on dufresne who exploits every possible opportunity to bring a taste of the outside world to himself and his fellow convicts. their bond forms the backbone of the film. tim robbins is right at the top of his game as he paints a fascinating portrait of an unjustly incarcerated inmate and brings an innate humanity to stephen kings principal character. freeman is exceptional as red and his narrative much of which is taken verbatim from kings story holds the story together and like a skilled conductor waves a baton to orchestrate our emotions. frank darabont uses his powers as a supreme storyteller and an astonishing craftsman to breathe life into a genre that i thought had been dead since the great escape. he leaves us a poignant film with a powerful message of hope and redemption masterfully told. the films greatest triumph is its earnestness that makes even those moments that might have felt slushy achieve the dignity of genuine tragedy. it is deeper than most filmsfashions fade style is eternal  yves laurent filled with superslick

that anybody is actually thinking or feeling. pulp fiction is the antidote to those films. it is one of the most unique films ever made and it is brimming with fascinating dialogue with original humor with energy and with life. writer/director quentin tarantino has made a masterpiece of dialogue tone and setting. like the characters we have to be on our toes to appreciate the richness of the story. time lines and story lines intersect with sex drugs violence and humor in ways that we dont fully understand until long past the credits role. this film also stays with us long after the credits role appreciating its audacity intelligence and tarantinos boundless energy.fabulous one of my favorites. one cant but expect great things from the final film in the lord of the rings trilogy. but that isnt really fair because its very hard to top what is already very good and highly rated. with this in mind i expected the third film to be about the same as the rest with some people being let down because they had unrealistic expectations. and so it is - its more climactic more emotional and more bold but not necessarily better. the special effects are strained by the demands of the story more so in return of the king. dont expect miracles and you will appreciate the film for what it is. even more has been changed from the book than the first two films but of course the key elements are all there. as a fan i almost wished i didnt know the story because i was looking for too many elements rather than letting the film flow. but the second viewing cured me of this. bring on the extended version.eying that this film starts where two towers left off is somewhat misleading for the film starts a great distance from the walls of helms deep. return of the king opens with a flashback of smeagol andy serkis obtaining the one ring of power and an origin of his deterioration into the creature gollum. this opening recaptures an emphasis that was somewhat lost within the epic battles of two towers at thats the ring. the first installment the fellowship of the ring provided heaps of exposition on the rings importance and influence and in return of the king we see it pay off big time. after the armies of isengard have been defeated due to an allegiance between theoden bernard hill the king of rohan and the elves the main threat to middle earth is now concentrated in the kingdom of mordor controlled by the dark lord sauron. sauron has turned his eye towards the realm of gondor the last free kingdom of men and the wizard gandalf ian mckellan must warn denethor john noble steward of gondor of the impending attack while aragorn viggo mortenson heir to the throne of gondor and theoden gather men to aid against the armies of mordor. the dark lord sauron needs only to regain the one ring of power to conquer all of middle earth and two hobbits frodo elijah wood the ring-bearer and sam sean astin must continue their journey directed by gollum to mount doom the only place where the ring can be destroyed. got all that if not you need tone up on your lord of the rings before expecting to follow this film. i want see this movie again and again  theres a lot of emotion on display and its frequently overwhelming. jackson gives the audience what it wants and gives himself the pleasure of having created a work of art that is deeply personal as well embodying as it does notions of chivalry and honor that go all the way back to `heavenly creatures. in order to bring the massive story to closure jackson is forced to concentrate more on plot and battle the films centerpiece the oversized battle at pelennor fields is enthralling with plenty of swaggering action drawn from the warner bros. swashbucklers of the thirties and have his cast shoulder the responsibility of maintaining interest in the characters--but fortunately everyone is up to the challenge with sean astin as sam for whom the story is ultimately about and elijah wood as frodo sensitively handling the supporting role to which he has been relegated being the moral centers. jackson and production designer grant major for the finale have combined the best design schemes of the previous two films the warm colorful textures of the `the fellowship of the ring with the rocky monochromatic landscapes of `the two towers and the result is a breathtaking moving cinematic experience that delivers the trilogy into movie legend  the fact that its now over means that audiences will feel an acute loss at christmastime from hereon in.everything from themes to dialog to underlying storyline is a modern-day classic one can watch this movie 10 times and come away with some new perspectives each and every time even the music is totally engrossing see this movie a one time viewing is not enough its like an onion each viewing peels another level and each new level reveals insights you didnt notice before the film strikes deep emotions and introspective tones without being overly intellectual you never feel like your sitting in a literature class but nonetheless you find yourself diving deep into the characters most remarkably it does all of this deep thinking while keeping a wonderful sense of humor its a real trick to be exploring these engaging powerful and even violent characters and yet keep you laughing too bottom line its like a 10 course meal with all different flavored levels that still manages to keep the watcher wanting more a modern masterpieceeverybody --well okay not kids-- should watch this movie i watched it for about 60 times literally from beginning to end i can write endlessly about what i like about pulp fiction and in the end still have something left to say so i will stop my comments right here just watch this movie you wont be disappointed but beware there are some bloody scenes with explicit bloodshed/violenceevery true fan of the original sleeping beauty 1959 was skeptical about this and how much it had to deviate from the actual movie and as more of the movie was revealed it was only proving to be another female empowerment victimized villain kind of a movie but im glad i was wrong for im sure only by watching the

takes breath with excellent direction and visual effects that will truly transport you to another world and the amazing work by all the supporting actors yes the other characters werent as fleshed out as maleficent but i see that as good thing given the title and theme a spectacular balance id also like to bring light on the enchanting  thanks to james newton howard this maestro is underrated a

but certainly as entertaining a film that it is being a personal favorite does not necessarily make it a great film or dare i say_„îthe greatest film ever made. but what then makes a film great first and foremost if it sets out to entertain the general public it must do that and shawshank certainly does that. its pure entertainment value is essentially a stipulation in its inclusion in the great imdb greatest movie debate. the serious nature of its central plot points_„îa wrongly convicted murderer who assists the corrupt warden as means to affect his own escape_„îis contrasted by some truly funny scenes. although by no means a comedy the splendid screenplay is wrought with witty dialog. theres nothing fancy about this film_„îno special effects spectacular scenery or even a bunch of pretty women. no its just the telling of a story mostly through the narration of morgan freemans character red that almost lulls viewers into believing that nothing really interesting or important is going to happen here. but after all of the subtle plot twists i think what makes this film great for me is i feel like im actually sharing in andys redemption. now if that isnt what they teach in film-making 101 then they should just close up the classroom. ultimately there cannot be a single motion picture that is the greatest film of all time because as art and in an art form as varied as cinema greatness must be measured by each individual. greatness as beauty truly is in the eye of the beholder. but in this beholders eyes i think the shawshank redemption is truly the greatest film i have ever seen.every so often there is a movie with full originality great acting great filming and wide twists in the plot actually this isnt fully original since it is about a disappearance but the subplots and curveballs thrown are good enough it follows a seemingly happy couples affleck& pike journey after the wife goes missing throughout the movie secrets will be revealed and the unexpected will ensue as we find out what really happened to the wife and how the marriage already was the themes of dishonestly media and perceiving are what make this movie important to see if there wasnt important themes there would not be importance and the movie itself would not have been as good this movie is a firstrate thrill ride that has not been done amazingly since inception back in 2010 inception was an actionthriller whereas gone girl is a mysterythriller and i honestly cant remember the last mysterythriller that was this good alfred hitchcock would have been impressedevery once in a while you come across a movie which touches your heart in a way you cannot describe. it moves you and affects your take on life. this is one such movie. it will fill you with an undefinable happiness and youll never be able to get enough of it. the acting: splendid acting by tim robbins. he carries the role of an educated lawyer partial to music with enviable charm and subtlety. morgan freeman of course is as good as ever. his narrations are always a cherry on the cake. the soundtrack: an elegantly restrained balance between the grim tones of the shawshank prison and the more melodic influences of hope. perfectly in conjunction with the acting. i hope anyone who hasnt seen this movie sees it. i hope...every minute of the film is epic the visuals the dialog and the . the film alone is a masterpiece in the way the story is brought to its climax the music brings it to another level of emotion. the first two films build the momentum for a huge finale the battle of helms deep was incredible but the real battle is yet to come. we see man and beast collide over numerous battles whilst we see frodo and sam struggle on their quest meanwhile the other members of the fellowship face their own obstacles and ultimately fight to survive. the ending really creates a roller coaster of emotions regarding particular characters some of their lives are in jeopardy. i must conclude that this has been my number 1 since its release and i doubt i shall see another film as good. greatest film to end the greatest trilogy.every mind has billions of ideas and each one of us do things that no one expects us to do some of those things are visible some not_„_ but one of those things that make our life worth living is freedom tim robbins stars as andy dufresne a young man who faces a long long time in prison after he is wrongfully found guilty of murdering his wife and her lover. while inside he learns an awful lot about what a man can hold onto and let himself be put through if there is still an ounce of hope in his soul. bottles of cool drink on a hot rooftop a slowly building library collection the moment of musical joy that sees dufresne severely punished for his overstepping of the mark and many other scenes spring to mind as classic moments in a movie almost chock full of classic moments. andy quickly gets befriended by red morgan freeman actually the narrator of the story both soon prove that even in the worst circumstances within the hell on earth they can maintain human dignity and strive on their own way to freedom... morgan freeman is the films secret strength playing the guy who can get it for you with a note of welcome ambiguity. watching him in an early scene when a fat new convict fresh fish is being beaten by cruel head guard captain hadley clancy brown you dont know whether red looks so crestfallen for the victim or for the packs of cigarettes he just lost betting the guy wouldnt break before dufresne james whitmore was equally memorable as a prisoner who was unable to adjust to the outside after his parole following a 50 year stint. this shows that people who have been incarcerated for such a long period need some sort of readjustment training before they rejoin society. for whitmore freedom meant ultimate doom making the scene one of my all-time favorite displaying the ultimate dark side and a certain fear in freedom. tim robbins morgan freeman along with james whitmore etched unforgettable performances as prisoners charged with crime. the film shows what prison life is all about. subjects dealing with prison survival brutality corruption and ultimate redemption are well shown. an outstanding film dealing with prisons as seen by several prisoners. many social problems are discussed here. the picture earned a well-deserved best picture oscar nomination. it certainly should have tied with the winner the equally good forrest gump. my rating - 10/10every generation of movie goers sees one film maybe two that changes the game for them it becomes a signature moment that they remember years to come they remember where they saw it who they saw it with even where they were sitting christopher nolan has proved to be a film maker who works best with a big canvas and he has never been given a canvas bigger than the one he used for his latest film interstellar i feel i cant even call going to see a nolan piece a movie but more like an event for the average movie goer they most likely arent familiar with the directors of the films theyre seeing but most know nolan most know of nolan because he has made some of the biggest thrilling and thought provoking films of the past decade from the dark knight trilogy to inception its almost not worth trying to do a plot synopsis of interstellar because it is difficult to try to condense the happenings in a film this huge because i know that i will leave out something big anyway the film takes place in a potentially nottoodistant future where the earth has become unable to produce all but a few crops and it will get to a point where none will be able to grow and man will die out in comes an engineerpilotfather cooper matthew mcconaughey who is entrusted to be part of a space expedition to venture beyond a newly discovered wormhole to try and find a new planet capable of inhabiting the human race astronauts from previous missions have supposedly landed and have been sending signals for them to come mcconaughey has always had that movie star potential and i think this is the film that puts him in that title this was a truly star making role due to the size of the film and i honestly believe he is the only man who could have done it interstellar was originally supposed to be done by steven spielberg before he dropped out and nolan stepped in nolan clearly influenced by past spielberg films like close encounters of the third kind and jaws puts mcconaughey in a role in the same vein as richard dreyfuss in close encounters or roy schneider in jaws they needed an actor who could be looked at as an everyday guy who is experiencing incredible circumstances and mcconaughey is able to display the emotion required for a man who has to drop everything including his family whom he knows he may not see again and try to save the human race you can see it in his eyes and hear it in his voice and your heart breaks and lifts with his simultaneously this isnt necessarily a role that wins oscars but it should be the effects are obviously amazing this much like gravity last year is a film that needs to be seen on the big screen especially in imax this along with the haunting  of frequent nolan collaborator hans zimmer almost transports you to that necessary place that makes the events happening on screen seem possible kind of piggy backing off of that point there will be those who will trash the film for the science isnt accurate those comments are nonsense because no matter what science tells us there is just no way for us to actually comprehend what is beyond a wormhole or what would happen if we attempted to go through one could we really transcend time and space? would we discover new worlds and new civilizations? impossible for us to say at this point but what makes this film so great is that we are able to see the ideas of what can be its the mystery of the unknown that both frightens and enthralls man and few films have been able to capture those feelings like interstellar in a time where there are no more explorers were fortunate to be put in a position where we can feel what is like to discover and explore new worlds people will remember interstellar for either being a truly great film experience or not as good as 2001 a space odyssey this is one of most popular slights against the film so far as it is the closest thing to 2001 and defenders of the kubrick classic will argue to the death that it doesnt live up to it this is an argument that no one will win because it is a generational issue people see these landmark films during their youth and they leave such an impression on them that it almost becomes blasphemy to hear of another film made years later rivaling the one they saw people want to believe that the film from their time was the best and that no film will be able to capture those emotions they first felt and the memories that it created for them i respect and detest this because i will most likely feel the same way when future space adventures in the same vein as interstellar come out and i fear it is something that is out of my control much of the film circles around the idea that love is the one true thing that travels purely through time and space because it is that connection we feel with one another that makes us human and that can be applied with our love for certain films the connection we feel with our favorite films is almost unshakable and those who think they can make us waver from those feelings are exercising in futility in the end interstellar is one of those landmark films its a chance for us to escape reality and feel sense of adventure hope and amazement that rarely comes around dont miss itever since i was a little girl batman has been like my role model. i absolutely love batman when batman begins came out i waited for the sequel i was too excited i knew it wouldnt let me down i mean christopher nolan is the director and with an amazing composer like hans zimmer i had very high expectations for this movie. when i saw it i was blown away. the joker portrayed by heath ledger was something else. something so sinister dark unique he really captured my attention and everyone elses. my favorite scene was when he was being interrogated. his view on civilized society and just his view in general about anything really played around with your mind. rest in peace heath ledger.it is a long movie but it has the right for it to be 152 minutes. just when you think it might be coming to an end when they capture the joker and save harvey boom plot twist because thats just another part of his plan. then boom rachel dies it really sets in an emotion one of the sparks for the final outcome of the movie. the cast was amazing amazing directorcomposeramazing everything. i have watched this movie so much too much. great movie it really has a major significance in my life no kid or person that love batman will be disappointed. my favorite movie of all time and i highly suggest you watch this movieeven when this trilogy of movies directed by peter jackson isnt entirely faithful to the books in which it was inspired i think that it does capture the essence of the monumental epic written by tolkien managing to be solemn and magnificent but keeping all the exciting fun from the original story. all the elements that made the original book a timeless work in the history of literature are present in three movies from the epic background to the most subtle subtext elements a quality that makes this trilogy of movies being something more complex and significant than any other fantasy movie that i had seen before in my life. the production values are superb being able to recreate all the grandeur of the middle earth. every single scene from this movie has an incredibly level of beauty without comparison having all of them the perfect mood and atmosphere for each part of the history. all the scenes are wonderfully directed showing a great love for the original story and the characters from it: the music the performances the visual effects_„_every single elements fits perfectly creating in that way an outstanding cinematic experience that possess the timeless greatness and magnificence from the original books. while the fellowship of the ring serves as an excellent introduction to this fantasy world and the main characters of this story the two towers works incredibly well as an inner exploration of the personalities of the characters as they struggle against their personal conflicts. finally the return of the king closes the story in a more than satisfying way with a moving resolution that is happy sad and nostalgic at the same time. those three films will always have a very special meaning for me being not only a great trilogy which is incredibly well done and its very entertaining to watch but also a unique cinematic experience that at least in my opinion couldnt be matched. personally i consider this trilogy the ultimate example of the genre of fantasy in the history of cinema. 10/10 i would rate the 3 films with eleven stars if i could.even though this movie is over 10 years old the message about friendship and not ever giving up will be relevant forever. the lessons that the main characters teach us in the face of adversity are timeless. this is also one movie that does not get old and i have watched shawshank many times. tim robbins and morgan freeman were spectacular in their performances. they teach lessons that are extremely memorable and have quotes that you will never forget. the one quote in the film that is a stand-out is get busy living or get busy dying. who would not feel the impact of that quote this is one movie you have to have in your library and i am not one that usually buys dvds. this is a must see dont miss this one and also keep a box of tissues nearby.even though im a huge fan of movies based on comics especially when its marvel i wasnt quite sure what to expect about this one yet my mind has been made up pretty fast during the first minutes of this movie the fun laughter and entertainment awesome soundtrack starts pretty much right away by minute one even though i see myself as a bit of a critic when it comes to jokes in action movies  had a blast during the whole 121 minutes  including the credits yep the characters are lovely the music as said fits just perfect and the action isnt missing either if youre looking for a good time  guardians of the galaxy brings it even after the second installments grand success i was still afraid that it will fail. the trailer was brilliant and promised a thousands things to come. and then in the next 3 and a half hours i was proved wrong this was the best conclusion to a great trilogy. i never imagined that they could make it bigger and better than the last two. the previous movies were just picnic. not only the action sequences but also the emotions run high. the battle scenes were really great. but i was more concerned about the people we knew from the last two films who were in it. you really get that feeling of the return. unlike the first two this movie is stylish. the elements are more elegant the story more bold the  more experienced and bold and the dangers more troublesome. as frodo and sam march towards mount doom the movie gets more darker and hope really seems to fade away. one thing i learned in this movie is: never give up. no matter what happens you have to finish the task because your cause is important. for me and all the lotr fans this is not a movie. what we thought of as an action movie-of-the-week turned out to be an important lesson on hope friendship conquering your fears and love. its a cinematic achievement that will never be defeated. this really is the king of all movies and the 11 golden statues prove it. go for it only if you have seen the first two movies 10/10essential viewing this film is an absolute heavyweight i must have seen it dozens of times by now and it doesnt really ever stop being entertaining a lot of the most well made movies dont really allow themselves to be fun they try to be more of a statement and i love that it brings me an immense joy to watch a classically structured no-nonsense beautifully artful film but pulp fiction is just so much fun that it managed to infiltrate the ranks of the elite and when it got there it decided to throw a party whats not to love about pulp fiction every aspect is built like a roller coaster  the film is just a big crazy amusement park most important to me though and im sure many others would have to be the storys structure have you ever seen a chronological timeline of the film its crazy its like when the film is in the correct order it doesnt make sense anymore it wouldnt fit the film because its too much fun for an a to b the way quentin tarantino weaved the films content together is so extremely impressive because it works so well the film just flows the transitions are so fluid and the story itself is just so interesting that the way it shifts around itself creates so much intrigue and makes it so thrilling just as integral as the way the story is presented is the characters that present it vincent jules and butch are really just normal people in the world of pulp fiction but to the viewer theyre so much larger than life not only do vincent and jules have an unforgettable chemistry as partners but what was really incredible to me was the chemistry vincent and butch had as enemies without even really knowing each other the conflict between them created by just two encounters is astounding jules though jules is excellent a great character played by a great actor samuel l jackson steals every single scene hes in his monologues are legendary this man must have needed some great vengeance and furious anger to be able to deliver those lines the way he did he was one bad mother i remember seeing parts of the film as a kid and wondering what the rest of it would be like i thought seeing the whole movie would be like opening pandoras box on my concept of what a movie could be looking back i think i was right epic batman gets the film we have all waited for masterpiece. i must say many comic book movies have neither the depth or interest to get you involved in the film this had everything. the cast are the strongest of any film of dc/warner to date and ledger is mesmerising as the chaotic joker. i first saw this on opening night in leeds the cinema was packed and people were sitting on the floor it was that full the film stands head and shoulders amongst the other two nolan batman films and for good reason. the reason this is such a strong film is the direction nolan knows how to weave the correct story and place the right actors into their affiliated roles. bale is great as the brooding batman and ledger is a worthy opponent mentally. gary oldman is great as commissioner gordon and the acting is out of this world good from all involved. you can see why they chose ledger as he has brought a whole new joker to the world. the story concentrates some time after the events of batman begins and batman has been successfully cleaning the streets of gotham with great effect. now though comes a new criminal-mastermindenter review for pulp fiction

because no matter how many times i see it i still get the genuine feeling of hope the film has delivered since the first time i saw it. everything about this movie is perfect  the story is always first what is impressive is how for an original story with such scope of themes and ideas to be explored not much is really missed in the film and it is so expertly adapted one cannot fail to overlook any of the flaws purists might make a point of and be simply overwhelmed by its power edited in 1946 a banker named andy dufresne tim robbins is convicted of a double murder even though he stubbornly proclaims his innocence. hes sentenced to a life term at the shawshank state prison in maine where another lifer ellis red redding morgan freeman picks him as the new recruit most likely to crack under the pressure. the ugly realities of prison life are quickly introduced to andy: a corrupt warden bob gunton sadistic guards led by capt. byron hadley clancy brown and inmates who are little better than animals willing to use rape or beatings to insure their dominance. but andy does not crack: he has the hope of the truly innocent which together with his smarts allow him to prevail behind bars. he uses his banking skills to win favor with the warden and the guards doing the books for nortons illegal business schemes and keeping an eye on the investments of most of the prison staff. in exchange he is able to improve the prison library and bring some dignity and respect back to many of the inmates including red. based on a story by stephen king the shawshank redemption was the directorial debut of screenwriter frank darabont. what a spectacular movie it is. i remember seeing this movie when i was a child but couldnt remember much of it so i decided to watch this movie now once again. people are not crazy when they think it is one of the best movies of all time. almost half of the world population might have seen it maybe the second most loved movie after the godfather. one of my very most favorite movies of all time one of the best movies ever made a highlight of 1994. this truly is an masterpiece a pure work of genius. a near perfect classic movie. a movie that will never get old a memorable movie. will always be remembered. it was nominated for 7 oscars unfortunately didnt won any best picture adapted screenplay cinematography editing sound original  and actor in a lead role morgan freeman. best picture that year went to forrest gump. story of this movie just so wonderful with so much to say in layers. it is story of tim robbins as andy who is been falsely accused of murder is being jailed in shawshank there he meet morgan freeman as red he and other cellmates becomes friend. andy is a weird and unique inmate there which when i found what he did or was doing just shocked me he is jaw dropingly genius. he becomes a personal banker to a corrupt and very cruel warden sameul played by bob gunton and his other men. he secretly works on his own legal case while he is educating and trying to improve lives of his other cell mates he makes them read and study since he himself is an educated man. he escapes from jail too in the end which is an epic scene to me. this movie stars tim robbins morgan freeman bob gunton bill sadler clancy brown  james whitmore  gil bellows  mark rolston  jeffrey demunn  dion anderson  ned bellamy  bill bolender  larry brandenburg  brian brophy and others. tim robbins gave a good performance just like he did in mystic river but this time you may see him smile too. i like his performance did justice to his character. i liked him when i saw this movie first. then there is mr. morgan freeman as red which according to me was a 100% perfect casting he was very good in his character delivered a very good performance. this movie overall features good performances. and i like both the characters of both andy and red memorable characters they are. and also their chemistry was so good in this movie. directed by frank darabont whose only movie i remember after this one is the green mile and tv series the walking dead. he really did a good job in this movie superb work indeed. truly impressive. screenplay of this movie is excellently written. superbly executed. you will love the way this movie grows on you completely and completely takes over. i was hooked to this movie. editing of this movie was really good. good cinematography and art direction. just a good of everything. good  too ofciurse. this is one of the best prison movies a truly heart touching inspiring uplifting thought provoking timeless sad movie that will be loved by every person with a soul in them. a very moving movie. i loved it truly very lovable movie that i dont even need to recommend it to you. most of you have seen it but if by any chance not the a must must watch.dont know how many will ever see the 2086th comment in this site - but just saw a friends dvd of this film again. i had missed it due to being in europe on an extended business trip when it played first-run and caught some portions of it a few years later and then completely sometime following. this was the third or fourth time id seen it straight through and it is one of those very rare films which is as good - maybe even better - on successive viewings. robbins freeman gunton and all of the remaining cast - whether in larger supporting roles or smaller - are outstanding without a single exception. my friend is a computer whiz with an iq of probably 150 and widely-expert expert in this area. but hes so immersed in this realm that whenever forced to use pen and paper instead of mouse or keyboard he does so on about the 5th-grade level. after the film he had bought the dvd but had never seen it before he stated he didnt feel the robbins character could have pulled-off all the shenanigans with the money from prison via mail and perhaps sometimes using a messenger of the wardens the way the film depicted -- whereas today if such an inmate had a computer terminal available it would be more possible. i told him i felt certain the opposite was true. in the era of the story a very intelligent financially-adept individual - especially a former whiz-kid bank v.p. - could have done what was shown even more effectively and successfully than via computer today with all the firewalls and in-house computer nerds any bank has. someone with both tremendous financial and hacker ability might - but not as easily as tim did during a period when signatures and figures on paper and the like were the governing elements. this aspect is one of the most critical and climactic for the story and its very satisfying ending. and gunton a tremendous actor who has done many sympathetic characters presents one of the best performances portraying a truly evil person - more so for the quieter and nasty-nice elements of this portrayal. he juxtaposes quiet demeanor often even pious with completely selfish vicious amoral actions as well as humanly possible with his performance in this role this is a film for which the term perfect piece of entertainment does not exaggerate.dont be fooled by my review guardians of the galaxy wont help you achieve enlightenment fall in love or lose weight especially if youre the chick who sits beside me crushing a popcorn tub singlehanded but if youre looking for a great movie this weekend you wont find anything better on the big screen guardians delivers what it promises and more that being said as is always the case with marvel studios productions some wont enjoy it guardians isnt part of the superhero genre however its science fiction none of the characters are superheroes technically thus comprises the ragtag band one human two aliens one genetically enhanced one anthropomorphic raccoon and one humanoid plant it belongs in the intergalactic genre the same barrel as star wars and star trek if that sounds displeasing you may be in the same boat as the douchey dude two seats down from me the opening scenes a tearjerker and im swept up so to speak it takes place on earth and involves nothing extraterrestrial at the emotional climax he speaks is this when the raccoon shows up? douchey dude asks the popcorn vacuum not only is it unfunny and in bad taste its illustrative of his mindset hes completely unwilling to buy in his wrapup comment postviewing is it was all corny if hes so above it why go in the first place? i try to avoid personal yarns but am endlessly astounded by the behavior of other adults if you cant let yourself enjoy the movie then dont go see it james gunn the writerdirector is just a great guy hes been on the adam carolla show twice recently hes enthusiastic intelligent and wants to do the sequel if the first is received with public favor in his latest appearance on carollas podcast gunn claims they cast chris pratt as the lead when the actor was out of shape but its clear pratt got physically fit by the time shooting rolled around zoe saldana is the queen of science fiction she plays a major role in both of the more recent star treks and wears similar makeup in avatar saldanas phenomenal as gamora and you can tell she does a lot of her own stunts plus shes enchanting its odd how lovable she can be with all that makeup on bradley cooper is almost unrecognizable as the voice of rocket the raccoon everybodys been talking about as per the usual coopers great this is vin diesels second voiceover role as a humanoid being not only is he the voice of groot in guardians hes also the robot in the iron giant 1999 karen gillans performance is particularly noteworthy shes a scottish actress whos quite prevalent in doctor who and played a role in last years oculus gillans terrifically menacing as the bionic woman shes creepy and evil and fits the tone of the movie perfectly hopefully we see more of her in the future its overall a balanced vastly diverse cast of characters the sum total of which makes for a well acted movie guardians does a lot of things right the writing constantly defies convention and satirizes common scifi themes for example when the heroic outlaws ask for help from the authorities its a relief to see their calls considered rather than immediately dismissed much like the humorous discussions of plan creation guardians masterfully navigates clichs location and contextual details are presented in a cool and efficient fashion digital readouts accompany interstellar approach shots of planetary environments as the perspective transitions between settings the shooting editing cinematography music and  are all impressive i think its time we retire aint no mountain high enough from all future soundtracks though that song belongs to remember the titans despite some overcompensating laughter in the theater the humor is strong and consistent although the end credits leave much to be desired the opening credits are informative and wildly entertaining there is a lot of action both handtohand and aerial combat its well choreographed and thrilling i wonder what percentage of the onscreen material is cgi it must be upwards of fifty percent but it all looks realistic my only criticism regards the scene after the credits its a major disappointment if you dont understand the reference im almost twentyfive and although ive heard of it im still outside the joke if the reference is slated toward an audience older than me why cant this movie be rated r? i know all the answers to my question theyre just infinitely dissatisfying and i was hoping for something that gets us looking forward to the sequel regardless its a tiny failure in an otherwise remarkable film guardians of the galaxy is cute thrilling and fun its everything we can ask from

extended edition ee of return of the king. take heart however that there are good reasons for every entry on this list because most of the scenes were known to have been filmed as still shots have turned up in various books that have been published on the film and even the official movie site. also apparently not long ago jackson gave an interview to a german magazine and gave a ballpark running time for the extended edition of 4 hours and 15 minutes. this may just be a rumor but if true the ee will then be roughly 50-55 minutes longer than the theatrical release. things most likely to be seen in the extended edition: 1. the wrap-up of the saruman-wormtongue story line. jackson has already gone on record that this 7-minute scene will be the ee. sarumans and wormtongues fate will be spelled out here. 2. the confrontation between gandalf and the witch king. this doesnt happen at the breaking of the main gate but instead on the walls of minas tirith. pippin is with gandalf on shadowdfax and the witch king is riding a fell beast. 3. the houses of healing. many missed the part of eowyn and faramirs relationship. the houses of healing will show aragorns healing ability and help fill in this beautiful sub-plot that resolves eowyns unrequited love for aragorn. 4. the trek across mordor. think that sam and frodos journey seemed a bit compressed once they were inside mordor the official movie book provides a two page spread of pictures and explanation of frodo and sam getting caught up in the orc armies and forced to march with them as they are mistaken for deserters. its reasonable to assume that this and other scenes with flesh out the final trek quite a bit more. 5. merrys pledge of service to king theoden. pictures exist of this scene but not much is known about how it is fleshed out. 6. confrontation at the black gate with the mouth of sauron mordors chief human lieutenant. although no pictures of this scene have surfaced the mouth of sauron was credited in extended cast lists to the same guy who played the train master in matrix revolutions. 7. eomers discovery of king theoden and eowyn where they fell on the battlefield. if there is indeed 50-55 additional minutes then this list is by no means exhaustive. there will probably be a lot of longer scenes like in the two towers ee as well as several wholly new scenes we know nothing about as yet.do not go gentle into that good night old age should burn and rave at close of day that was one hell of a dialog from the movie #interstellar even though it was inspired from a poem chris nolan made a film which makes even science freaks also dont know some of em which he implied in the film it is evidently clear that he doesnt like this 3d world which instead he created 5d world and made time as a physical quantity in his world literally there is no words to explain the ingenuity of chris the way he crafted the characters and effectively using technical expertise and screen writing definitely make us to taste transcendence once again he proved that he is not a contemporary director but a director who evolved from unrealistic future matt did a splendid job by portraying cooper and express his emotions as a destitute and griefstricken father was incomparable hans zimmer he is at his best anne and jess made justice to their roles matt damon and michael caine played a pivotal role as well chris also made india as part of his film because of mom i think even though it is little about india i think overall film is astoundingly superb with intense screenplay unless you detest physics or you lack keenness but its better to study a lilbit before bon appetite remember do not go gentle into that good movie #interstellar and #inception are the best scifi masterpieces ive ever seen in this decade take a bow chris nolan and orgoglioso di es sere un fan di christopher nolandirector quentin tarantino gives us a cinematic master piece with the film pulp fiction an anthology movie that is not told in chronological order which is what i think is a great idea to keep the audience on their toes to see what happens next. the first story titled vincent vega and marcellus wallaces wife follows vincent vega played by john travolta who is told by marcellus wallus played by ving rhames to take care of his wife mia wallace played by uma thurman. they go to a 50s style restaurant titled jack rabbiit slims where the famous twist contest happens. the story really escalates when mia has a heroin overdose and has to have an adrenaline shot. fun fact: the scene with vincent sticking the needle in mia was done by having john travota taking the needle out and running the film backwards because if he had actually jabbed it in he would have broken uma thurmans ribs. the second story titled the gold watch is about famous boxer butch coolidge played by bruce willis who is supposed to throw a boxing match but does not and ends up killing his opponent. he and his girlfriend fabienne played by maria de medeiors who are on the run by marcellus wallace. they eventually get kidnapped and get sexually assaulted by 2 psychos zed played by peter greene and maynard played by duane whitaker. butch ends up stealing zeds chopper saying the famous line zeds dead baby zeds dead. the third and final story titled the bonnie situation is about vincent vega and jules winnfield played by samuel l jackson who end up killing their friend named marvin played by phil lamarr and end up going to their friend jimmies house played by quenton tarantino and get help from winston wolf played by harvey keitel to clean up the mess before bonnie played by pam grier. they end up going to a diner which is being robbed by pumpkin played by tim roth and honey bunny played by amanda plummer. this is my favorite of the 3 stories. filled with crafty dialouge excellent story telling and great cast of characters this will always remain one of my all time favorite films. i definitely recommend this work of art. rated r for strong graphic violence and drug use pervasive strong language and some sexuality. 2hrs 34min/154min. 275 uses of the f-word. ****/****direction 10 of 10 script 10 of 10 once this story catch you it wont let you. how many movies mix comedy drama action so well its a non-stop roller coaster lines 10 of 10 actors 10 of 10 they are terrific. i want to sum up a 10 for each actress 1 of 10 sorry maggie you did a regular role but you arent pretty fx/makeup 10 of 10 im still wondering if it was makeup o fx. youll understand me photography 10 of 10 sound 10 of 10 music 10 of 10 delivers/fulfills/achieves its purpose i dont know how this category should be named 10 of 10 ------------- 91/100 oh man 100/100 i love this movie the film started at 11pm and ended around 2am but i disagree with it being top 250 #1. it deserves #2.despite being a very long movie and not very action packed for that matter i found the shawshank redemption one of the most entertaining motion pictures i have ever stumbled upon. and i think that the entertainment value a certain film may hold is largely over-looked among film critics and most people who watch films with a critical eye. but i hold it as probably the single most important feature in movies in most cases. and by entertainment value i do not only mean how it feels when you are watching the movie but also the picture it leaves on your mind that makes you want to see it again and that you can look back at and actually experience the feeling you gain from actually watching the film. and this is where shawshank really shines. the 2 hours just went by and left me with a really good feeling after wards for some time. but the other features should not be ignored either in any case. i really like the way shawshank makes you think. for me it was mostly about how good i actually have it and about life in general. it really made me want to better my ways in all sorts of ways. but unfortunately it wont last forever but thats why its good you can see the movie again. and when you do it will still have the same impact on you as it did the first time around.despite all the hype i never liked the lord of the rings in fact i thought they were stupid. however one day i decided to give it a try and i watched fellowship of the ring-one of the greatest movies ive ever seen. the next day i watched two towers and loved it more than fellowship. now i just finished watching return of the king aka: a masterpiece. return of the king has everything including 11 oscars it is tied for the most with titanic and ben-hur also receiving 11 great acting great script and a good story that is exciting almost every minute great heroes great villains ahem gollum and a great script. now you may be expecting me to say so this movie is great but its not its fantastic and by the end you just want to give anyone involved in the making a big hug and a congratulations this movie is one of my favorites watch this movie after youve seen the slightly worse prequels youll be doing yourself a favor.deservedly ranked at the top of imdbs all-time best 250 films ever. the casting is superb: morgan freeman is red a wise observer of people and an entrepreneur inmate whos made connections so he can get contraband to other inmates for a pricedefinitely worth watching again i would say although it was released 1994 the storyline and the acting were good this movie is a mixture of humour and violence though the plot and storyline does not really go smooth in a way there happened to be those intersecting story lines in this movie but that is how it attracts the people to watch it isnt it the dialogue and lines in this movie are priceless they were so good and you cant seem to get it out your head i specifically enjoyed the part where uma thurman comes into picture i liked her since the movie kill bill she is beautiful and she has shown her talented acting portrayed in this role and samuel l jackson which i do not really have to elaborate he has this unique way of making appearance and playing a role that no one would be able to forget his roledecided to check out imdb topper as a time pass and was i glad i did.one watch and the shawshank redemption has been added to my all time top movies...the golden year of 94 which gave the world some of the best films of all time didnt disappoint with this one...the cast was superb...tim robbins is amazing and morgan freeman again shows why he is at the top.the bond between the main characters is well developed and the climax is mind blowing.the movie gives genuine inspiration and is more than suitable for repeated viewing when one feels down.i give it full 10/10 as it gives u more than a regular film does.it shows the importance of hope in life and why one should never loose it.the tagline tells it all - fear can hold you prisonerhope can set you free...david fincher is one of those directors i get excited for as soon as a one of his films gets released he just knows how to make a bloody good movie his track record of films is just getting better and better with time so gone girl based on a book by gillian flynn is probably the best film i have seen this year so far it keeps you on the edge of your seat for so long and while it may not have a ground breaking original idea nothing really does nowadays it does it well ben affleck and rosamund pike do great jobs as well as the rest of the cast especially rosamund who really does smash it out of the park i got the same feeling off her as i did from rooney mara from the girl with the dragon tattoo hey look another film mr fincher directed its just an intense thriller with themes that go along with it like marriage and relationships and how we portray ourselves for people in our lives and the public not much to say really apart from watch this moviethe only criticism i can find with the film it is quite long and the opening is slow a build up to a great pay off i feel the book would fill any gaps that other people may find with film and i heard the book has a different ending also so if you do not like the ending maybe read the book for a more satisfying conclusion? the ending for me made sense and maybe open up for a sequel? meh who knows anyone watch this film thanks and hope this was useful for anyone who reads thisdavid fincher has always been one of the top directors hollywood has to offer and his newest title gone girl helps to showcase that fincher is still at the top of his game fincher gets the most out of his actors ben affleck plays the sympathetic yet deeply flawed nick rosamund pike perfectly captures to sociopathic amy tyler perry gives the best performance ive ever seen from him neil patrick harris plays the stalkerobsessed role extraordinarily well and relative unknown carrie coon is fantastic as nicks sister margo the script of gone girl is fantastic in that it drafts characters that are both sympathetic yet simultaneously deeply unlikeable fincher pays great attention to detail and it really shows in the overall presentation as the film looks beautiful gone girls sound is amazing and helps to build tension and quicken the pace at appropriate times the plot is complex enough to be interesting yet simple enough to be bluntly understood by its audience *spoilers* gone girl revolves around the main character nick affleck who is framed for his wifes pike murder early on there is some ambiguity about if nick had killed amy but this is quickly dispelled as it is seen that amy is alive throughout the movie there had been splices between present day and the story of amy and nicks romance yet these flashbacks dont tell the full story as amy reveals that she was attempting to frame nick for her murder as revenge for his infidelity and because well shes a psycho the story then revolves around the media circus that follows nick and margo around as a witchhunt led by the nancy grace inspired ellen abbott threatens to tear their lives apart all the while nick lawyers up perry plays tanner bolt the lawyer and attempts to prove his innocence the true value in gone girl lies in its social commentary finchers main point comes from the rapid shifting and manipulation of the media the massive character assassination of nick by abbott and others leads to him being portrayed as the most hated man in america when in reality he is innocent the media has massive power and its ironic that nick is eventually loved when amy returns and isnt dead in fact abbott nicks biggest enemy even interviews them to end the movie gone girl is a 1010 movie for me because of how deep the storyline is the movie flies by and i didnt want it to end because of how drawn in i was the performances and writing are fantastic and this movie has to be in strong contention for best picture this yeardavid fincher has a longitude of successful booktoscreen adaptations under his belt

you on edge of seatdavid fincher for the longest time now has been one of my favorite directors and this film just reassures my admiration for him fincher is responsible for masterpieces like seven and fight club if you know and have seen these films then you know both films are very elaborate and result in a mind being blown this film shows that fincher still hasnt lost that great touch of taking very clever stories and bringing them to the big screen so basically in conclusion to this thought if you are a fan of david finchers past work like the 2 i listed or you just like films that keep you guessing then i recommend this film to you although the film has good performances especially from rosamund pike who definitely deserves her oscar nod the film isnt made to be enjoyed for its performances its actually made to be admired for its unpredictable and twist filled story the story originating from a novel written by gillian flynn is very well executed revealing just the right things at the right times to keep the story pretty much constantly unpredictable along with some rather shocking moments this review is kind of hard for me to write because even though i really enjoyed the film through and through i just cant find the exact words i want to use to express why i enjoy it so for that i cant guarantee all these words are useful for everyone there also seems to be a surprising number of people who hate the film but to be honest most of these people seem to be trying to hate the film by nit picking and desperately trying to find reasons to dislike it for reasons i have no idea why no offense to the nit pickers im sure you have some kind of reasons as long as you are not one of those nit pickers then im pretty sure you will enjoy it or you will end up hating it for some other reason in conclusion my only complaint is that the ending was a bit weird but still worked this film is also one of my favorites of the year and i have been able to get through a number of re watches without being bored i dont think it will win the oscar for best supporting actress but if it did i wouldnt be disappointed im hoping you enjoy this film like many others and myself have and believe me you will know if you enjoy it however if you arent as fortunate and end up disliking the film for some reason then im sorry my words werent useful to you and that you ended up wasting your time thats all i can think of to say for this film thanks for reading my reviewdark yes complex ambitious. christopher nolan and his co-writer jonathan nolan deserve a standing ovation. i dont usually go for loud movies filled with mindless gore and violence. the dark knight is certainly loud and violent but its not mindless. it has depth and soul. even the joker in an extraordinary creation by heath ledger is deeply human. the natural petulance of christian bale makes his ego and alter ego the most fascinating and complex of all film superheroes. part of the genius of this movie is that batman himself in screen time is not really the lead. my attention was captivated by heath ledger and he determines and inspires the breathtaking atmosphere that envelopes gotham as well as us. the aplomb of christopher nolan as a director is mind blowing and his secret i believe is his obvious respect for his audience. what hes done is to elevate a popular genre into shakesperean proportions. excellent workcould a movie be any more perfect this movie is just absolutely stunning in so many ways. acting perfect storyline perfect soundtrack perfect emotional drama perfect everything about this movie is perfect. when this movie first came out it did not reach the expectations that many people expected it to. but as the years went one it was nominated for seven academy awards and as it was available for rent everywhere more people started appreciating it and its popularity grew. eventually after many years in the top 5 of imdbs top 250 movies of all time list it hit number 1 with over one million votes. the story is about a well educated vice president of a large bank being wrongly accused of murdering his wife and her lover and is sentenced to spend life at a large prison in new england called shawshank prison. as the years go on in his new home he makes friends enemys and a dramatic twist at the end which became one of the most legendary scenes in movie history. i love this movie. the acting is just so passionate and their performances increases the drama and horror of life in prison. the soundtrack is one of the main reason behind the emotional drama this movie. many scenes in this movie almost left me in tears mainly because of the soundtrack in the background which increases the emotion. the cast of this movie include academy awards winners morgan freeman and tim robbins. and also william sadler bob gunton and many other who made this movie what it is. overall it is defiantly the greatest movie ever made with passionate acting great storyline and plenty of emotional drama about how hope overcomes fear in a beautifully crafted film about the strength of the human spirit.  theyre either angels or devils or souls beset by the latter and in dire need of the former to show them the way out. but who would care if pf hadnt been so well written directed produced or even acted in the first place considering it took 4 separate films to lay the foundation for the avengers what guardians was able to pull off is quite remarkable while i thoroughly enjoyed the avengers what that film lacked was drama  you knew the avengers were going to come out on top with guardians all bets were off because none of the main super heroes are really marvel mainstays like iron man hulk et al this lead to a much more suspenseful film while the film does an excellent job developing characters that the audience is emotionally invested in where guardians truly shines is as a comedy chris pratt does a great job being a lovable goofball super hero add to all this beautiful visuals  the nova corps battle scenes are sensational and you basically have a perfect family filmcomments on the now completed film - not just rotk. say friend and enter else let your prejudice prevent your respecting what is categorically the greatest cinematic achievement to date. imagine having the arrogance to believe that you have the vision and imaginative energy to put together a ten hour film that does justice to the seminal work of fantasy literature..... take a step back my cynical friends and measure this extraordinary accomplishment against the mountains of uninspired patronizing holywood rubbish with which we are daily assailed. consider the sheer hotspur and determination required to see the work to its conclusion and to remain consistent and steadfast to the vision over many years. think of the thousands of actors and technicians with whom you must have the energy and communication skills to share your vision. no. no one has come close to this as an achievement. even if the end product were merely so so id be saying the same thing. but regardless of the quibbles that you are bound to have with something this provocative - jacksons the lord of the rings is a far better movie than anything this long has a right to be. lotr is comparable in breadth and success with wagners ring cycle or the michaelangelos sistine chapel and with tolkiens original novel of course. to bring together convincingly all the elements required to make the film a success is no less a worthy achievement than these gesumptkunstwerk. many criticisms arise from judging the three movies separately. this is incredibly unfair imho. the ending of rotk is not too long when considered the end of a ten hour movie. similarly the final opera of wagners ring cycle is fairly pointless without the proceeding three and is rarely performed or judged on its own. now im not a wagner nut myself - but this doesnt stop me from appreciating what is an incredible work of art. its a shame that small rather petty prejudices - born often out of loyalty to other movies as much as basic fantasyphobia - prevent some a tiny minority for sure from appreciating the film for what it is. id ask the cynics to take the time and effort to stand back and admire lotr from an objective distance. for some this is a long walk. however the view like the location in which it was shot is breathtaking. youve shot straight at your friends headand when you wake upyouve taken s--t in the car and its full of blood and skull pieces.what will you do to hide from the copsthere are many things like this.well its great.enjoy the acts and screenplay.some dialogs are so funny some are about bad things.pulp fiction is a real pulp fiction.pulp fiction is the lord. comic book movies as we know them are over. gone are the special effects laden cartoons like the incredible hulk and fantastic four. consider this the official death of a movie like superman returns which was beyond terrible. the dark knight redefines the comic book movie and changes all the possibilities of where superheroes go and what theyre capable of. there should be no doubt that the driving force in this film is the ever maniacal joker. i wouldnt doubt the fact that hes probably going to go down as the greatest comic film villain of all time after being portrayed so brilliantly and effortlessly by the late heath ledger. the joker never fails to deliver the most diabolical and sinister games that force all the films heroes to have to make sometimes painful choices. in his own words im an agent of chaos. bruce wayne christian bale realizes that to stop the joker he has to become something he swore never to be. this results in an interesting turn of events that really cant be put into words but i will tell you it involves a chase scene. the film really crosses the line in terms of the traditional comic book film in its exploration of human nature and raises implications on social political and moral levels. the last time i saw a movie with that many themes was the multiple academy award winning children of men. personally ive always felt films that use fiction to explore the current reality we live in or the ramifications of our decisions usually give us a cold harsh reality check. christopher nolans screenplay and choice of dialog is more complex than any comic film not to mention considerably more poetic. gotham city let batman operate without having to answer to the law. what happens when you give one man all the power gotham city district attorney harvey dent aaron eckhart explains when their enemies were at the gates the romans would suspend democracy and appoint one man to protect the city. it wasnt considered an honor it was considered a service. his girlfriend who also happens to be bruces ex-girlfriend rachel dawes maggie gyllenhaal shoots back harvey the last man to protect the republic was named caesar a lot of these implications wouldnt be relevant if we werent living in post 9/11 america so i recommend you read up on something called executive unitary theory to get the full effect of giving one man all the power. apart of what made this film so hard hitting was the stellar performances. none of them were actors this time they were actors who completely lost themselves in the characters they built every one of which we come to care about. lieutenant jim gordons gary oldman promotion to police commissioner is well deserved. the movie also allows oldman to take gordon to new heights and really shows how batman and gordon are in this together and gordon as a character really comes of age. the dark knight in the end wasnt merely about good and evil. it was about the fight for gotham and showing the citys people that you could overcome evil with good. early on someone mentions that harvey dent is gotham citys white knight. dent is a handsome well educated elected official. the people paint the picture of him as this incorruptible force of good. batman on the other hand is a vigilante  and worthy it was. the fascinating performance of morgan freeman and tim robbins the direction and everything puts you in the place of the actors making you feel the way they felt. this movie doesnt have any dirty romance or impossible actions rather it focuses on a greater philosophy - hope to live when there is no hope survival -- this is one movie that will leave you talking about it even many days after watching. i wont say anymore the rest is up-to you to find out when you see the movie christopher nolans work is amazing. visually stunning powerful and moving. too bad heath ledger couldnt make more like these. dialogues are equally lifted by beautiful acting. i cannot imagine anybody else replacing any of the current cast and end up doing it better. neither could this have been made a better movie had it been directed by anyone else. it raised the expectations so much that to me the sequel seemed weaker. dark knight beats dark knight rises hands down any time of the millennium. watched it more than once especially for the joker. this is one of the movies where i would be eagerly waiting for the villain. have to rate it 10 on 10. too bad that it was only a 3 movie contract.christopher nolans the dark knight is my favorite movie of all time. this movie created my love for movies and even for batman and the joker. from the moment that hans zimmers gripping  beings in the opening scene to the first time we see heath ledger give the performance of a lifetime as the clown prince of crime i was hooked. the setting feels dark gloomy and even evil at times but yet i am compelled to buy a plane ticket to the city. i would like to say that this is because of batman that i want to fight the crime in gotham and be a member of the gcpd but less corrupt. but the truth is that i want to see the joker from a safe distance. the joker offers such high levels of charisma and dark humor that you dont have to fool yourself by saying you love to hate him. be honest you hate that you love him. in this city of corrupt cops dirty money white collar crime and gang activity who better to look to than someone who makes even the most wicked of people look sane. nolan has presented a world where the joker isnt so much a mad clown as he is a mad scientist. maybe he lacks morals but even his most convoluted plans are artfully crafted. the dark knight is not a comic book movie. the dark knight is an action movie based on comic book locations and characters. that seems simple enough but i stand by the fact that it is the only film of its kind including the other two in the trilogy. even the best of comic book movies such as iron man or the avengers are still very much comic book movies. the dark knight was able to rise above that title to become something more than that. christian bale gave us the best performance as bruce wayne as seen on the big screen to-date and heath ledger gave us possibly the greatest performance of all time as the joker. i do not give this  to films very often but the dark knight is undoubtedly a 10/10.christopher nolans the dark knight changed things forever. theres no going back. it is one of the few films that was thought to be one thing and ended up becoming one of the greatest films of all time. this was the first movies i saw where i talked about things that were discussed in the film itself and what it must mean to be a hero like batman. but more importantly the acting writing directing and the cinematography make this a rich and tragic film that will forever stand the test of time. the story begins a couple months after the events of batman begins in a noticeably more realistic gotham city and batman has petty criminals and the mob running scared. the determined new d.a. harvey dent emerges as another symbol of hope for gotham city albeit a more lawful position as batman. then enter the joker a demented terrorist who sets up unbelievably dark and twisted situations to test the moral compasses of batman dent and even commissioner gordon. as a man bruce wayne has a crisis is batman doing more harm than he is good he learns that he may become something more awful than the joker just to stop him. director christopher nolan leaves behind all the jokiness and sometimes unfulfilled soul searching of the previous batman films and with his trilogy this more than others redefines what a superhero movie can be. he shows the characters for what they are flawed but idealistic as well as struggling to deal with the joker as they themselves descend into a very dark place. nolan and his brother jonathon have given us a very polished and well thought out story by itself. this is the second film where i actually paid attention and love the story characters and became emotionally invested the first was toy story long ago and then there is the acting. the acting is top notch by all actors. the real star of this movie is the scene-stealing joker played by heath ledger. he transforms the joker from all previous incarnations and puts a very demented and modern twist on it. he truly believes he is humanity fully realized and an agent of chaos the theme of the film he wants to turn the gothamites into wild animals who will according to him eat each other when the chips are down. ledger very deservedly although posthumously won the oscar for this portrayal and is still being hailed as one of the best villains in any medium. christian bale is in top form as bruce wayne/batman and gives you a tender and heartbreaking side to the character. he does begin to build his mythos but struggles when people doubt him and push their fears onto what he stands for. i will say the actor who really got me invested was harvey dent played by aaron eckhart. two-face is one of the more tragic villains of the batman rogues gallery. he is a truly moral and good man fallen from grace by tragedy in his life losing rachael to one of jokers vicious traps it hurts bruce too in a love triangle that for once in my life i thought was very well constructed and perfect he becomes an evil and twisted brute who relies on a coin to make a decision to kill for him. chance. unbiased unprejudiced fair. he too was a villain i thought equal to the joker but in a different way. it is rather emotional when things happen to him and that is the sign of a great storytelling and acing approach. commissioner gordon played by gary oldman presents a man who knows the system is corrupt but remains idealistic and knows that batman is doing good for the city. and at the end knows he will have to atone and be accountable for any sins he may have committed over the course of the film. the action scene are a wonder to behold. they look real and was pulled off with little to no computers all real stunts. nothing was over the top at all even two-faces design looked scary and oddly enough like he got burned by something on one half of his body. every incarnation before this looks awful by comparison. every scene in this film showcases cinematographer wally pfisters rich color palette/lighting scheme and his keen eye for detail even in the simplest scenes. he and nolan will go down as one of the great cinematographer/director duos ever. this film is a a perfect work of art. the dark knght really was a game changer when released in 2008 showing the industry and fans what a comic-book movie can be just as richard donners superman had done in 1978. this is a movie that i loved dearly on my first screening and one that will not disappear off my list.christopher nolans sequel to batman begins is absolutely brilliant. the dark knight offers everything you want in a film. a hero who must push himself to stop a criminally insane man who only enjoys chaos. the cast did such an amazing job. returning from batman begins is christian bale michael caine gary oldman and morgan freeman. coming aboard we had aaron eckharts character harvey dent. with also heath ledger who played the villainous joker who was absolutely phenomenal. this movie had me on the edge of my seat the entire time making me wonder whats going to happen next if you have not seen this movie yet watch it. you will not regret it.christopher nolans sequel to 2005s batman begins is one of those rare films that transcends the boundaries and preconceptions of its genre and becomes something much much more. from the very opening shot you know youre in for something different - something special. batman is not alone in his fight to rid gotham of organized crime and poverty-driven violence teaming up with a hotshot district attorney and his ever faithful friend in the police department jim gordon. but none of them see whats really coming - a dark malevolent force of nature called joker. this isnt your fathers goofy wise-cracking clown...this joker played iconically by the late heath ledger is a maniacal anarchic nihilistic beast hell-bent on the dismantling of civilizationchristopher nolans second bundle of joy the dark knight exceeded all of my expectations with the success of 2005s reboot of the batman franchise they took what was already established and expanded it amped it up and gave a deeper darker and brooding story that is more gripping and the suspense is likely to catch you of guard several times throughout. christian bale delves more deeper into batman sworn to fight evil and injustice though also quite reluctant and uncertain if his crusade can ever end and cleanse his inner turmoil from his fractured soul due to the murder of his beloved parents. but with the help of his trusted butler/ally alfred played superbly by michael cane grounds him gives him moral support and keeps him in check. but the real star of the show is heath ledger as batmans most deadly enemy the joker. i can honestly tell you that: as good as jack nicholson was in batman89 he is childs play compared to this joker. he is sadistic psychotic and downright scarier and psychologically disturbing than the previous incarnation of the clown prince of crime and ledger gives it his all to do him justice. along with the original cast comes some fresh faces such as aaron eckhart maggie gyllenhaal and more. i must say though i liked katie holmes gyllenhaal gives a much better performance and is a far cry from the damsel-in-distress stereotype though theres a little of it thankfully thats common in films. bale and gyllenhall have much better chemistry this time around more so than holmes. even better the fight sequences are vastly improved and feature more brutal and bone crushing combat than begins in addition to new technology at batmans disposal. also worth mentioning is screenwriter jonathan nolan who gives the film an added frosting to an already delicious cake. simply put the dark knight is totally more bad ass than begins. the action is great and the plot is more deeper and engrossing. i applaud christopher nolan christian bale and especially heath ledger who sadly passed away earlier this year and all those aboard for believing in mr. nolans talents for this second installment. although some may feel a bit of melancholy over ledgers death but as a final note i will say this sincerely from my heart: remember heath ledger and honor him in your minds and hearts not only for his performances but as a human being and father to his daughter matilda ledger. may we issue him best wishes for his family and friends and his daughter for years to come. remember . . . honor him not only for this role and past roles but as an incredible individual and talented actor. rest in peace. heath ledger: 4/4/1979-1/22/2008.christopher nolans latest film in the batman movie franchise is superb. the acting is some of the best i have ever seen you really feel like you know these characters at a personal level by the end. the joker really pushes batman closer and closer to the line the separates crime-fighter and vigilante. and bruce wayne struggles to keep his personal life away from his batman side. heath ledger is amazing as the joker he does everything correct even the signature laugh. at one part the joker is sticking his head out of a police car enjoying the chaos that he just put upon gotham. throughout the movie batman constantly struggles to thwart the jokers plans of mayhem before they can take effect and he fails for the most part until the end but i shant spoil that. this movie is the darkest batman movie ever this new take on the batman franchise is great. and this movie really embodies how nolan wants batman to be. and the movie is just overall amazingchristopher nolan steps back into the directors chair for this sequel to batman begins which finds the titular superhero coming face to face with his greatest nemesis -- the dreaded joker.

to batman begins which finds the titular superhero coming face to face with his greatest nemesis -- joker in this movie entitledthe dark knight. christian bale returns to the role of batman maggie gyllenhaal takes over the role of rachel dawes and brokeback mountain star heath ledger dons the ghoulishly gleeful joker makeup previously worn by jack nicholson and cesar romero. just as it begins to appear as if batman lt. james gordonplayed by gary oldman and district attorney harvey dentportrayed by aaron eckhart are making headway in their tireless battle against the criminal element a maniacal wisecracking fiend plunges the streets of gotham city into complete chaos.nolans inspiration for the film was the jokers comic book debut in 1940 and the 1996 series the long halloween which retold two-faces origin. in addition elements of steve englehart and marshall rogers dark detective miniseries as well as the unpublished follow-up were reportedly cannibalized along with other elements of batman mythology for the story. in gotham city the joker and accomplices rob a mob-owned bank the joker killing off the others and escaping alone. batman and lieutenant jim gordon decide to include the district attorney harvey dent in on their plan to bring down gothams mob currently led by sal maroni. batmans alter ego bruce wayne meets dent and rachel dawes deciding to host a fund raiser to show his support for dent. the joker approaches the mob offering them his services should they need it. corrupt accountant lau working for the mob flees to hong kong but is dragged back to gotham by batman agreeing to testify against the mob.maroni and the chechen turn to the joker who begins murdering people on a daily basis unless batman unmasks himself. among the casualties are commissioner loeb. the joker targets dent at the fund raiser bruce hiding him. the joker tries to assassinate mayor garcia during loebs memorial service gordon taking the bullet and seemingly dying. rachel is targeted bruce and alfred pennyworth looking after her. at a press conference dent claims he is batman instead of bruce who planned to confess to the public and is escorted by police to county prison. the joker intercepts but is caught by gordon who faked his death. gordon is promoted to commissioner as a reward. however rachel and dent both disappear batman confronting the joker and learning both are in building filled with explosives. batman and gordon go to save them batman finding dent and saving him but rachel is killed when the explosives detonate. dents face is set on fire and half of it is left severely scarred. the joker escapes from the gotham police department with lau.coleman reese an accountant working at wayne enterprises under lucius fox realizes bruce is batman and plans to publicly expose him. the joker who kills lau and the chechen threatens to bomb a hospital unless reese is killed. gordon rescues reese while the joker visits the crazed dent in hospital convincing him to get revenge on those who truly killed rachel. dent kills officer wuertz and spares maroni and officer anna ramirez using his lucky coin to decide their fate. the joker threatens to takeover the city putting two ferries of citizens and arkham asylum inmates against one another giving them to decision to blow each other up. batman confronts the joker aided by lucius using a machine able to detect phones across the city and use them as a locator. the ferry passengers refuse to kill each other and batman captures the joker but not before he learns of dents rampage. dent lures gordon to the building where rachel died holding his family hostage and threatens to shoot his son. batman arrives tackling dent off the building to his death.deciding to take the blame for dents victims batman forces gordon to make him a fugitive and portray dent as gothams true hero. in the closing scenes gordon destroys the bat signal and lucius watches the locator machine self-destruct and batman flees the police gordon considering batman the citys real hero. dark complex and unforgettable the dark knight succeeds not just as an entertaining comic book film but as a richly thrilling crime saga.it becomes more than just a superhero film unlike the others released like supermanspidermangreen latern and many others as it was more than a comic-book adventure but a sprawling crime epic.allusions to our current struggles with surveillance public perception and terrorism are thrown into the mix adding political immediacy to nolans psycho noir.the acting of the cast was simply superb and outstanding particularly the late heath ledgerwhose last role the joker would still go down in cinema history as one of the most creepily unhinged big-screen bad guys of all time.finallythis also proves that christopher nolan is much much smarter than your average filmmaker.it was simply one of the best films ever made and the best superhero film ever made.christopher nolan has effectively raised the bar for movie makers everywhere including the big american cojunasin terms of execution and for movie goers in terms of expectations. this film works on every single level. the cast is excellent.. christian bale delivers again as the best batman the franchise has ever produced.although not perfect mrs gyllenhal does a very good job as the vigilantes love interest and not as aesthetically appealing as katie holms but much more credible .aaron eckhart comes as the dark horse of this film who would have thought mister cool had those types of acting chops in him credit to the whip of mr. nolan.the screenplay is pure goldthe dialogue are cunning straight and emotionally mature.you couldnt find any clichÍ© or meaningless word in here. it is a pity this movie did no receive the academy nomination it has been a long time since the last time i watched a movie as good as this. in true mr nolan has anointed himself new king of hollywood this movie is indeed pure cinematic artit has action dramacomedy it has everything and it also has a great uplifting ending. hail to the new king of movies and keep on making themchristopher nolan has created a superb film that can be enjoyable for those of all ages the story was rich with emotions action and excitement as matthew mcconaughey gives us an oscarworthy display of acting the special effects were absolutely wonderful and the amazing audio that hans zimmer provided only added to the movies toptier development ive seen the movie multiple times and in each of those fullypacked theatre moments i was in people stood up clapping and cheering and then left with the largest smiles on their faces which achieved the actual point of movies pleasing the people and giving them something to remember not to meet standards that grouchy and lonely so called critics set to make it boring and stupid it seems like many nolan haters and so called astrophysicists all criticize the film by attacking nolan not the film this is laughable because for one no one will pay attention to their comments besides other nolan haters who will vote yes agree by filtering for and finding fellow worst reviews this film will stay in the top 50 or maybe even reach the top 10 as things are looking right now and the haters will drown in the crowd of people who acknowledge and can see that this is a great movie as interstellar soars high haters can look up wave goodbye and stay on the low ground that they cant leave fromchristopher nolan comes back to direct the 2nd batman movie which finds the titular superhero face to face with his greatest nemesis - the dreaded joker. christian bale returns to the role of batman maggie gyllenhaal takes over the role of rachel dawes from katie holmes. heath ledger makes the appearance as the joker previously stared by jack nicholson. just as it appears that batman jim gordon and the da harvey dent is making progress against organized crime they face their deadliest foe yet a complete maniac turns gotham city into chaos. four opposites makes an excellent blending to create one of the most perfect movies ever made.  believe me this film is made for multiple viewings...dont hate this after viewing it once or twice give it at least more than 2 viewings before you make up your mind. im positive it will become more and more better after each viewing and probably you will end up loving it. if not maybe it was just not your cup of tea. i hope this film satisfies everyone and i really dont care if its no.1 on the imdb or outside top250. its not fair to hate a film because your favourite is not above it in the rankings its a deeply satisfying movie that makes you understand the importance of hope. 9.8/10 p.s. technically{all round film-making} it may not be the greatest movie of all-time{that honor can go to godfather/lotr:rotk/star wars 4etc.} but it certainly goes down in my book as one of the finest and a movie to savour for ages. children i shall be talking about interstellar but before i do i think i better give you a little context just to show how high my expectations were for this film i love christopher nolan i am a nolanite or nolanoid or whatever people who like christopher nolan are called ive pretty much loved every film hes ever done it confuses me when people slag him off because hes clearly the best writerdirector to be working on mainstream blockbuster films since steven spielberg only i think that his films are much better than stevens his films are only so thrilling because of the intimacy he creates between the audience and the characters as soon as i heard christopher nolans next film was a scifi film called interstellar i was excited i was so excited that i only treated myself to one viewing of the teaser trailer and first trailer it was enough i was sold and i didnt want to see any other trailer because i wanted to know and see as little as possible i decided that interstellar needed to be seen in imax so i booked my ticket to see interstellar on the biggest screen in the uk even though the film had garnered some mixed reviews i was hoping for fullon rave ones like when the dark knight and inception came out i still put my trust into christopher to deliver me something extraordinary i dont know if its the gigantic screen talking but interstellar absolutely delivered this was the best experience ive ever had at the cinema the huge screen and earpopping sound made the experience incredibly intense and by the end of it i felt like i had been for a little trip out in space im not sure if this will translate quite so well on your tv screen at home however the film is unmissable whatever you choose to see it on whilst a lot of the film does rely on extraordinary visuals and heartstopping setpieces at its heart its an intimate family drama which suggests that your children are your one and only important universe i was absolutely sucked into the film from the moment it started the stuff before matthew goes into space is probably some of the best stuff in the film we learn so much about coop and he becomes a worthy character to invest three hours into three hours which fly by i might add theres a strong focus on the relationship between coop and his daughter and its this relationship which drives the film right up to and including its jawdropping conclusion the first hour is also quite funny too which was a nice surprise as nolan doesnt normally dabble in too much humour theres a really emotional scene where coop wants to say goodbye to his daughter who he doesnt know when hes going to see again before his space travels its beautifully acted by both matthew mcconaughey and mackenzie foy and is at the powerful centre of the whole film after this the film adopts an entirely new setting literally were blasted off into space and the fun really begins the less you know about the space scenes the better as its a lot of fun to try and work out just where the film is going suffice to say that interstellar is jampacked with eyepopping visuals and intense thrills which dwarf last years gravity into a speck of space dust by comparison with the dark knight rises christopher proved that he could direct on a big scale and interstellar is his biggest yet he has an ambition which most directors lack and instead of kicking him down for it we should be nurturing it interstellar presents us with new and exciting ideas which colossally blow other mainstream films out of the water the action is also elevated to unreachable new heights thanks to hans zimmers astonishing  its a haunting piece of music that will be ringing in your head for hours after the film has finished hes left the big drums and strings behind and reinvented himself with a bizarre church organ which perfectly matches the dark atmosphere of the film a lot of people have expressed a strong disliking to the final 40 minutes of interstellar i can see why as up until then the film is more or less possible to understand its complex but its still easy enough to follow however christopher completely rips up the rule book and interstellar goes seriously barmy in the last 40 minutes personally i loved the third act and it just goes to show the sheer creativity and ambition which christopher nolan has going inside his head i found it all very interesting both on a visual and intellectual level i dont understand it all but i have my theories and im sure that there will be a mountain of theories cropping up on the interweb interstellar is a truly remarkable experience it boasts awesome ideas and visuals but it never forgets its heart im a tough cookie to make cry but im not going to lie ooh poetry there were three occasions when i had tears filling up in my eyes there are some astonishingly powerful and moving scenes in there which reminds me why i go to the cinema i dont just want crazy visuals and excitement i want to be moved and i want to be invested in characters so that i care what happens to them at the end interstellar more than achieves that ill need to give it another watch to work out where id put it on christopher nolans mesmerising filmography but he hasnt let me down i hope that interstellar is seen as a scifi classic in years to come because it really does deserve that accolade read more weird dazzling and uncut

dark knight is one of the best superhero film ever made. he dark knight as a haunted film that leaps beyond its origins and becomes an engrossing tragedy. he praises the performances direction and writing and says the film redefine the possibilities of the comic-book movie. ebert states that the key performance is by heath ledger and pondered whether he would become the first posthumous academy award-winning actor since peter finch in 1976. ledger ultimately won the oscar he awarded the film four stars out of four.ebert named it one of his twenty favorite films of 2008. peter travers of rolling stone writes that the film is deeper than its predecessor with a deft script that refuses to scrutinize the joker with popular psychology instead pulling the viewer in with an examination of bruce waynes psyche.travers has praise for all the cast saying each brings his or her a game to the film. he says bale is electrifying evoking al pacino in the godfather part ii and that eckharts portrayal of harvey dent is scarily moving.travers says the actor moves the joker away from jack nicholsons interpretation into darker territory and expresses his support for any potential campaign to have ledger nominated for an academy awardtravers says that the filmmakers move the film away from comic book cinema and closer to being a genuine work of art citing nolans direction and the gritty reality of wally pfisters cinematography as helping to create a universe that has something raw and elemental at work within it. in particular he cites nolans action choreography in the imax-tailored heist sequence as rivaling that of heat 1995. manohla dargis of the new york times wrote pitched at the divide between art and industry poetry and entertainment it goes darker and deeper than any hollywood movie of its comic-book kind. entertainment weekly put it on its end-of-the-decade best-of list saying every great hero needs a great villain. and in 2008 christian bales batman found his in heath ledgers demented dervish the joker. it is one of the best movie ever from christopher nolan. all in all though these are fairly niggling complaints. the dark knight isnt perfect but no film really is or could be. still while someone someday might make a better superhero movie the bar has been set very very high. the dark knight isnt just the best movie of the summer its the best movie of the year so far and everything else is going to have to try very very hard to top it. verdict ledgers performance is monumental but the dark knight lives up to it. nolan cements his position as hollywoods premier purveyor of blockbuster smarts _„_ and the batbike is kinda cool too. rating - 10 out of 10 t care as hanks did as much as a good job as freeman did if better. tim robbins was also amazing and likable with the supporting cast doing perfection to the highest level. the  is beautiful the mies en scene the scripting writing is gold and genius making this a classic. this film is not complex and it is something that makes it just so darn good. the pacing is perfect and the narration from freeman is timeless. the iconic shots of andy raising is hands in the air after escape is timeless as and should be attempted when finishing school as i have did. a film highly recommend by me and others as well touched me to the point of joy and laughter and will bloom your day as it always will live as cinemas most beloved classic ever. 5/5 can hollywood usually creating things for entertainment purposes only create art to create something of this nature a director must approach it in a most meticulous manner due to the delicacy of the process. such a daunting task requires an extremely capable artist with an undeniable managerial capacity and an acutely developed awareness of each element of art in their films the most prominent  that he had wished you had died instead of your brother. youd feel grief-stricken. the look on faramirs face in conjunction with the sorrowful music playing in the background makes it such a powerful scene. with watery eyes faramir then says since you were robbed of boromir i will do what i can in his stead so then faramir gathers his men to ride back out to osgiliath in a fruitless battle to reclaim the city. its such a sad scene because you know faramir does not have enough men to reclaim the city but he goes anyway to uphold the honour he has for his brother and halfwitted father. the whole scene is in slo- motion with pippin singing sadly in the background as the orcs draw their bows to kill faramir and his men charging towards the overrun city. its just all so sad and im pretty certain this scene will be very potent and indelible in my mind. in the battle for minasterith aragon saves the day with his army of the undead which to me pretty much felt like him putting in a cheat code and just demolishing every orc troll and mumakil on the battlefield. and this leads me to another point - gimli and legolass friendship. i loved watching their friendship grow stronger and seeing these two characters learn to tolerate each other over the three films. i also cherish the humour in their relationship i mean how can you not laugh after legolas impressively takes down a mumakil all by himself and gimli apathetically comments that still only counts as one i love scenes like this that lighten-up the mood of solemn situations. one of the stand out performances however in the entire movie is by samwise gamgee. as the voice of reason in frodos head sam tries to tell him that gollum is plotting to kill both of them and take the ring for himself but because gollum can empathise with frodo he believes gollums stories. when frodo is poisoned and paralysed by shelob the giant spider i really enjoyed seeing sam battle her and be all courageous and brave and dexterous. as frodo becomes weaker sam needs to become stronger and thats exactly what happens. when the two hobbits finally reach the volcano sam determinedly carries frodo up the mountain to the entrance that really demonstrates his development as a character in which the ring is later finally destroyed. it was interesting to see gollum hold the ring close to his chest as he falls down into the pit of lava yet even as hes sinking and burning and dying his one thought is to try save the ring. it just shows how evil can be tenacious and follow people to their death. in essence i felt this movie was the perfect way to end such a memorable trilogy. peter jackson did a superb job to make all the characters unique and significant in their own way and encapsulate what life is like during middle earth. the setting the costumes the characters the cgi and the story were all presented perfectly in a trilogy that will never be forgotten. bye far the best movie in the world and by far tarantino best piece of work to date  the cast for the movie is outstanding and even the cameo from the main man harvey keitel was the dogs this movie deserves to be number 1 by the conclusion of the first scene i knew i was in for something special the film is successful because all factors of the film are brilliantly executed. the screenplay which is written by the nolan brother is magnificent with many a remarkable scene. the costume and makeup correspond well particularly the joker his makeup and costume ensures that his physical appearance is all but unforgettable. christopher nolan and his crew shoot spectacular fast paced action sequences throughout the film we witness batman not once but twice used cars to break his fall and he outdoes himself on the second by catching his love interest rachel in midair. the joker uses a mans to aid him in his magic trick  making a pencil disappear. batman is nearly torn apart by dogs while harvey dent suffers serious burns to half his face although perhaps the most extravagant action sequence is the destruction of the bat mobile and then witnessing whats left transform into a motorbike. however the true beauty behind this film is the acting. every actor delivers a strong performance with noteworthy mentions to aaron eckhart with his unfortunate heartbroken and twisted harvey dent michael caine and his loyal wise and heartwarming butler as well as christian bale and his tormented determined and smooth billionaire as well as his fearsome awe inspiring alter ego the dark knight. nonetheless the highest praise must be given to ledger. ledger transforms himself into this psychotic villain becoming unrecognizable as the smiling humble actor we all knew him as delivering one of the greatest performances i have ever witnessed. in conclusion during the whole 2 hours and 32 minutes not once did i take my eyes of the screen. christopher nolans the dark knight is entertaining inspiring and terrifyingly beautiful.by far the best movie ever... no doubt this is the best ever movie you will ever see it is easily the best movie of my life-time so far. morgan free is a legend and rest of the crew did a marvellous job as well. well written / narrated and directed movie of all times. 10 out 10. it has been on number one ranking on imdb and most of the other movie rating websites forever now. the best past of the movie is narrated voice by morgan freeman. the character andy dufrain is a very well composed and the warden character has lot of punch into it. escape from prison was the best it can ever get. marvellous piece of art.  pulp fiction. its pertaining to old comic book strips usually containing lurid subject matter with a modern day twist. the film conveys this perfectly through the eyes of characters: vince jules and butch played by travolta jackson and willis. the non-linear time sequence also allows the audience to become more submerged in the multilateral plot by understanding how each characters actions eventually effect anthers causing the plot to intertwine narratives. the cool 1950s - 1970s rock n roll music also saturates the film in a cool and eccentric atmosphere which is then juxtaposed with gratuitous violence sexual violence and drug themes. this feeling is perfectly described by one scene of travoltas character vincent driving a cherry red convertible cadillac down a road at high speed with mia wallace uma thurman overdosing on heroin in the back seat. this is how the film makes you feel when it reaches its climax. on the other hand the relief comes with witty dialogue and great humour which makes you think about pop culture and society. the whole film is an absolute ride and my favourite of all time. by far the best comic book movie todate. but the the dark knight is also one of the best movies ever made. unfortunately it sets a standard for movies that few can ever surpass. batman is no longer a comic book character. torn from its comic book pages christopher nolan has taken batman far beyond anything the original creators bob kane & bill finger could ever imagine. one of the few blockbuster summer movies that is dynamic thought-provoking intense and fun. heath ledger gives a performance that is unmatched by any other actor. his portrayal of the joker is so perfectly disturbing it is almost scary. directing story acting and  are superb. 10 out of 10but... in the end of the movie when the hobbits arrive to the shire in the original book they encounter to the shire ruled by saruman.. in my opinion its a total offense to the book and their fans because the fight between the hobbits and saruman his very important to the hobbits. they leave the shire being a cowards but when return they are totally changed in the sense of warrior spirit and courage. anyway the movie is excellent.brilliant movie unbelievable acting incredible effects and a creepy evil that truly feels like a threat. nolans magnum opus the dark knight focuses on the psychological aspects of the characters and takes you on an unpredictable unbelievable ride you wont soon forget. the film does well in introducing characters and developing on them while also weaving a dark story of organized crime and chaos. ledger was well deserving of his oscar nolan sure does know how to make a completely engrossing film. the cast has done a superb job in portraying their characters without going overboard. christian bale returns giving both sides of bruce wayne equal attention the playboy and the hero as he did in the first film. aaron eckhart and maggie gyllenhaal also give fine performances. but it is the joker that really makes the film terrifying. he is insane but believably played by heath ledger.brilliant breathtaking thrilling these are some of the words that describe mission impossible the plot is really interesting although it may seem confusing if we take our eyes off the screen for some seconds brian de palma one of my favourite directors adds one more masterpiece to his career the cast leaded by tom cruise in a great role has important names as jon voight jean reno vanessa redgrave emilio estevez and kristin scott thomas emmanuelle bart is also great definitely not to be missed my rate 910brilliant breathtaking thrilling these are some of the words that describe mission impossible the

unexpected which can be pretty rare in a dramathrillerif your reading these reviews most likely you want to watch or already have and if your in the category of wanting to watch do it you will not regret iti really didnt think i would even enjoy this for some odd reason but after the first ten minutes that changed and for me to be able to say that thats a total plus in my book ps for all the lovely ladies ben affleck and tyler perry are some serious eye candy to boot enjoybreathtaking mesmerising shocking brilliant these are just a handful of words you can use to describe pulp fiction without doubt one of the best movies of modern cinema describing its non-linear plot is tricky it has to be seen to be fully comprehended basically pulp fiction is really three different stories two hit men and an eventful morning trying to deliver a mysterious briefcase to their boss another is one of these hit men vincent vega played by john travolta taking the boss wife out to dinner to keep her company while he is out of town and the third is an experiences boxer trying to earn some big bucks before retiring with his girlfriend the brilliant thing about the plot is the fact that it is presented out of chronological sequence and at times from different perspectives dramatic biblical monologues are repeated threefold and we see characters who have died in a previous scene reappearing in the next scene combined with this is the sublime screenplay written by tarantino is perhaps the best ever committed to film with defining performances from john travolta samueal l jackson and uma thurman as well as bruce willis only add to the films brilliancebravo finally this truly was a quality film the acting directing and writing this film is like something youve never seen from a superhero / comic book adaptation films. let me start with the acting heath ledger... everything has already been said about this performance yet he still managed to surprise me what a performance hats off he really does get under your skin created togather with writers of course the perfect joker or at least the one i wanted to see dark psychotic and a maniac. aaron arkhat or however you spell his name also gave a strong performance as hearvy dent and the other cast was pretty solid. the script is just great... this is truly one of the best films if not the best that portrait the battle between good and evil between what right and wrong and about making the right choices. now retrospectively i am really disappointed with the trailers for this movie they composed different sentences to give it a more intense feeling and gave a lot of the action in the movie... sure they were great but also gives you high expectations for this movie... and i hate coming to a movie with high expectations so a little let down in that aspect. and yes 2 hours and a half did feel a bit long. that been said tdk is a fantastic movie sure it has some flaws but what movie doesnt its well written directed and acted action packed and even epic in a way only time will make it. overall this is a must see movie for anyone that has a little sympathy for movies. 9.7/10boyhoodwhat a great movie i simply believe in america again they are also humans guys trust me its obviously doesnt matter if you are an american german or russian there are the same problems the same ways the same love inside us as a russian i must say i understand american people and also myself much much better with this movie it was like about me i just could not imagine how much we are all the same just love itif i look at my childhood in the former ussr i see not much difference the cars and houses are different we spoke russian but that feeling that pulse of life that sometimes lost fathers and mothers to solve every day problems fighting for the existence and good life for the children are so familiar to me that long hair and piercing oh boy its all so much alike and those paul was greater than the others the movie is just breathing its a three hours of fresh air i do not want to say much about the qualities of the movie it is overall brilliant i do believe this will be a classical film and students all over thew world will study it in future at their film schools ps sorry for my poor englishboyhood which was ambitiously shot intermittently over an elevenyear period from may 2002 to october 2013 to show the growth of young boy and his sister to adulthood is an experiencenot to be missed writerdirector richard linklater deserves an ovation for his sheer passion & masterful execution to this humanstory he narrates a tale of boyhood with unbelievable conviction you connect with its protagonist mason because all of us in some way or the other went though what he did and eventually we all grew up & our childhood ended forever boyhood celebrates the spirit of life & the circle of life which we all are a part of linklaters screenplay which spans a decade and a little more is beautifully done it explores so many themes but most importantly life itself the characters are real & so is their journey the dialogue are moralistic and despite a runningtime of over 165minutes boyhood doesnt lose momentum for even a single minute linklaters direction is sensitive he has handled the film masterfully & he without a shed of doubt deserves oscarnods for his work as a writer & director in here his unfathomable passion & love for film & art cannot be snubbed lee daniel & shane kellys cinematography captures the essence of the film most admirably sandra adairs editing is simplistically done performancewise ellar coltrane as mason gets into the character effortlessly & triumphs with a super act we watch him grow mentally & physically patricia arquette as the mother is terrific her emotional breakdown in the penultimate portions stay with you lorelei linklater as the sister who also transforms mentally & physically is wonderful but its ethan hawke as the father who steals the show his portions stand out thanks to his superlative portrayal others lend good support on the whole boyhood is not merely a film its an experience a salute to linklater & team
