if you can look past the horrid acting the more than just lacking substance plot and the under developed characters  this series is for you but then again if you watch something based on the leads sixpack somber mood and distant stares then you will love this poorly created series personally i prefer stories of substance a tale with progress characters and a protagonist that has more going for himher than just a pretty face orand chiseled abs it is hard to believe that arrow has survived critics and audiences and has made it to a renewal of a second season its sad to see quality writing ie smash be removed from channels and hogwash such as arrow be allowed to fill the mind of the average intelligent human
