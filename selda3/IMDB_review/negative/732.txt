i saw rotk yesterday and its undoubtly the best lotr movie peter jackson is a genius and i really hope he wins an academy award for best director as always some goofs can be found but who cares the patient waiting is over because this great movie has finally been released and now some words about the actors elijah wood frodo played his part tremendously well but one cant really call him the star of this movie even though he carries the ring which he eventually destroys sean astin samwise played a much interesting character and i hope he gets nominated for his role merry and pippin played by dom monaghan and billy boyd are also two very funny characters they have a very strong friendship and dom & billy really show that on screen my guess is that it will be lotr time at the 76th academy awards in march 2004
