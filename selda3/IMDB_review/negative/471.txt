gone girl psychopaths and woman beaters the first segment in the movie shows nick and amy dunnes marriage played by ben affleck and rosamund pike one day amy mysteriously disappears all attention is on nick as his reactions to the disappearing of his wife are distant and unsettling after nick is almost proved guilty it is revealed that amy planted all of the evidence in an attempt to get revenge on her husband we were all on her side at this point amys diary revealed that nick had beaten and sexually abused her as well as used all of her savings on senseless buys and then the film completely lost me amy reveals she faked the entire thing nick was not an abuser it is further understood amy has a history of making false rape accusations and more the film makes you sympathize with nick as he has become a victim of a psychopathic wife however nick still remains an incredibly unlikeable character who was taking advantage of a 20yearold amy then returns to her dissatisfied husband at this point i had completely given up on the film and was just waiting to see nick leave his psychopathic wife of course that wont happen instead the film ends with nick being trapped with amy after she confesses that she stole his sperm and impregnated herself gone girl had great potential but its plot twists ruined the film the acting was decent but the direction completely blurred the message if there even was a message at times even the actors looked like they couldnt believe how terrible the film was ultimately gone girl was unsatisfying and deeply disturbing but not in a good way the film tried way too hard to shock the audience but simply left us confused and deeply regretting ever even watching it gone girl was simply a huge waste of two hours
