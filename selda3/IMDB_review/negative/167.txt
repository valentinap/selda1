the first few minutes were good and promising however soon unreasonable stupidity took over and the whole thing was swallowed up into just another blockbuster clich_ even if in an unusual packaging lets compare it to transcendence despite its few flaws transcendence depicted a very realistic scenario from beginning to end it was reasonable with its depiction of humans too and remained so throughout not so this one it was made for the masses and the whole premise is stupid the scary thing is that this salivating blockbuster is cheered with a 9 rating while transcendence is written off as something unreal
