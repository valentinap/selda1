please dont waste your time or money on this hypedup piece of garbage i dont think ive ever been as disappointed in an ending not that the beginning and middle were all that great as i was with this stupid illogical movie the only spoiler i have is one of the biggest plot fails ever shes escaped her captor by slitting his thread shes virtually covered with blood and the hospital simply allows her to go home where she coyly showers it off totally amazing that this movie has gotten the positive press and reviews it has received  if this doesnt make you realize how incredible hollywood hypemarketing system is at distorting reality nothing will i only wish i could give it a zero
