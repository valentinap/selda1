im going to start off by saying that this is the first movie or show that i have ever reviewed and i have watched a lot of them boyhood seemed like a great concept to me and the trailer looked interesting enough to give it a shot but what really made me go to see it were all of these reviews calling it a masterpiece this may have been one of the worst movies i have ever seen if sitting in a chair and watching absolutely nothing happen for 2 hours and 45 minutes is something that sounds appealing to you then i highly recommend this film i honestly have no idea how someone could even call this a good movie let alone a masterpiece or a once and a lifetime experience im legitimately angry that i watched this movie
