last year i made the horrible mistake of paying and wasting my time to watch frozen in theaters because i thought it would be a great disney classic like tangled finally i can say that something good has come out of watching the overrated trash that is also known as frozen thanks to my terrible experience with disneys frozen i read the entire plot for this movie before watching it thankfully i ended up saving a few bucks as it was evident that this movie like frozen was not worth paying to watch maleficent was basically a nonanimated nonmusical version of frozen apparently disney ran out of ideas and decided to regurgitate the ideas from frozen with different characters wonderful as expected the main point was a rehash of frozens true love between women is better than true love between a man and woman because it sells well after this movie i can officially say that disney has completely lost its magic we are now to believe that dream guys dont exist in fact all men are either extremely evil or just stupid what happened to the brave prince charming in classic disney stories? disney has deserted them and has decided to start making more realistic movies nowadays and by realistic i mean movies with strong independent females who are clearly superior to the men disneys recent movies make me question whether they are even supporting the concept of true love or dreams anymore i grew up in a time where little girls could dream of finding their kind and classy prince charming but wait the people at disney had an epiphany having high expectations for guys is bad instead lets encourage little girls to dream of being bffs with a sister who ignores her for years or becoming her fathers worst enemys goddaughter instead im just thankful i dont have to grow up watching these lame disney movies i truly find disneys efforts in reversing its reputation of true loves kiss just pathetic hmm cynicism in fairy tales? just what we need as a classic disney lover count me out just a few comments 1 prince phillip used to be my favorite disney prince but here i guess hes just another tool used by feminists to shove their message down our throats 2 maleficent doesnt turn into a dragon yup you heard me whats the point of the movie then you ask? i have no idea also as you have probably already guessed theres no intense battle between prince phillip and maleficentasadragon either just splendid 3 why on earth is king stefan the villain? he was infatuated with maleficent and only married queen leila to take over the kingdom? what on earth has disney come to??? this movie is an insult to disneys sleeping beauty stefan>maleficent #teamstefanforlife 4 last but definitely not least whats up with trying to blur the line between good and evil? yes frozen im also looking at you this is by far my biggest issue with recent disney movies im sure walt disney is rolling in his grave actually since he was cremated perhaps i should say that his ashes are turning in his burial plot? either way you get the idea of all the stirring legends of the triumph of good over evil none has ever been so inspirational to me as sleeping beauty  walt disney i hate to say it but disney is dead walt disney however will forever live on in our hearts
