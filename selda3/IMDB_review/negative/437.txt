i checked the spoiler box just in case but nothing happens nothing to spoil huge waste of time everyone is allowed to formulate their own opinion about movies but i would highly recommend to stay away from boyhood this movie is terrible it is filmed over a twelve year period yes twelve same actors and actresses the movie is 2 hours 46 minutes long and we had to turn it off at 2 hours2 hours of my life i will never get back i love all kinds of movies action adventure drama comedy even a chick flick now and then but this movie went nowhere did nothing and ended up like every other person in life see it for yourself but you have been warned cant figure out how its up for 6 award nominations other than the artsy fartsy crowd loves this kind of crap
