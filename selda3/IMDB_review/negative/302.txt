it is so pathetic that disneys remake was extremely bad unlike the genuine cinderella movie unfortunately disney in its easy copying of the original movie achieved a total failure the weakness of this film if compared to the previous sequels it would simply appear as a clich disney pictures will rely on heavy advertising in order to attract the audience to see it if you are looking for creativity and an interesting movie this film will not cheer you up if you have much money and you got much free time to waste then all you have to do is see this awful movie
