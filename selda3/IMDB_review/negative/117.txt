they stole the entire movie from orlando corradis version of cinderella which was fantabulous creation i never knew they were such cheats guys do check out orlando corradis anime version of cinderella and youll know all theyve got whole storyline running from there its just that its not an animation this time orlando corradis version is really old one they needed peoples attention and praises so cheated whole thing from someone else how cheap isnt it? corradi is no more i guess but still i think his works are worth an applause maybe its just because am a big fan of animes but this is too much never ever gonna watch this disneys version i feel bad for corradi
