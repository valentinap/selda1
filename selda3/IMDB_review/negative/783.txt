 wow a lot of people have been fooled into believing that this was a great film ive never seen anything like it and i hope i never will again this is one slop of a film and im disgusted to know that it has so many high reviews it was a confusing ball of goo that amounted to nothing i didnt care for the characters and never will what a hopeless bunch of freaks i dont jump on the freak bandwagon unless theyre natural ones not arrogant embodiments of deranged entertainment the glorification of smut is worse than the smut and that is exactly what this movie is the sad thing is i dont believe that some of these actors were acting at all they were just being themselves travolta and jackson in wigs that was scary the only interesting thing about the movie was the sequence of events i like the way that it started at one point and ended in the same but dislike everything in between the problem with this film is that it tricks the audience into giving it great reviews it uses the peer pressure method you know this movie is for intelligent and cool people crap well ill gladly stand among those who know that this was nothing more than a shock flick it was produced to see if the letter could be pushed a little further unfortunately it drags what little respect that hollywood has with it im afraid that this is one of the major stepping stones to a pathetic industry that only produces films for vulgar lust theres my two pennies dont spend them all in one place
