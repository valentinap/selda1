why oh why do i give david fincher a second chance my mind always wanders when watching his films and pictures him at various moments over say 2 months writing his little ideas down as they come to him this movie is clearly the culmination of about 20 of those ideas and some that were brought back from the waste paper basket strung together with thread bare plotting oh and please david give your set designer the day off for the next one heshes needed at a new theme park to do the haunted house 2 out of 10 1 for the lead actors who give it there best and 1 for brad pitts bum cleavage that gave the movie its best too
