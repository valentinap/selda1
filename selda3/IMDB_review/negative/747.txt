 i think that star wars episode v the empire strikes back bis the worst movie i had ever watched although i have only watched it one time i really do not like this movie for several reasons first the movie does not have a proper ending it just stops when all the battles have finished and do not explain any other things after the battle instead it only shows a shot of the characters looking out the window this really disappoints me second about the love between princess leia and han solo i have never thought that leia and han solo are a couple until they suddenly kiss it makes me feel very surprised because the movie does not show any obvious relation between them third the movie does not tell story but showing a battle sequence instead it is very boring for audience to watch finally the battle of luke and darth vader did not bring out a mood of climax but instead it makes me think that it is ridiculous these are the reasons why i dont like this movie
