after first 30 minutes i was about to get out of the theater but i gave it a chance i left after 60 minutes great cast most boring plot i know that probably it has great cg overload effects at the end and all the good guys win i dont understand the actual rating for the movie i expect it to fall drastically in the next few days i suspect manipulation in here and it is a sad thing to see when the business takes over and the honest rating for the movie does not matter anymore great i want 60 minutes of my life back and the money for my ticket dont spend money on that dirt avrook
