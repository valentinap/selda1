for the life of me i cannot understand how this movie has received an 88 rating nor can i understand mathew mcconaughey he mumbles his way through the movie in such a thick texas drawl that english sub tittles are required not that he has anything interesting to say nor do any of the other characters for that matter so lets have a look at the plot the world has become pretty much uninhabitable due to some kind of climate change which has forced everyone to quit their jobs and become farmers the only solution to this problem is to send a rocket into space to locate a suitable planet for colonisation however everybody still drives around in massive gas guzzling suvs is there something wrong with this picture? in the normal run of events it would be impossible to travel the distances required to find another inhabited planet however a worm hole has been located somewhere near saturn which will facilitate interstellar travel its explained that this worm hole has not just appeared but rather it was placed there by some unspecified entity who is watching out for the human race so this unspecified entity has watched the human race make a complete horlicks of one perfectly good planet and now wants to give us the opportunity to do the same on another world? much hokum ensues regarding relativity and the way 1 hour for the astronauts is 10 years back on earth etc and it turns out in the end that it all has something to do with love but by the time they come to this conclusion i had lost interest the visual effects arent all that special seen it all before in fact i think the effects in 2001 aso which this film is so earnestly trying to emulate were superior if not in their execution than certainly in their creative vision in conclusion then a plot holier than a month of sundays a leading man to whom english is a second language nonsense dialogue and rather unimaginative visual effects adds up to 88? i dont think so
