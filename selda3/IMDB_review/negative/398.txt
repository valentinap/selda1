i love scifi and so hoped that this movie would be great given the reviews but it is literally one of the worst movies i have ever seen do not waste your time or money there are no emotional or intellectual catalysts behind this worse than b movie film who gives a damn about such stupid undeveloped characters? i am groot this is the best line of the film and groot a living tree is the best character enough said? if you like stupid campy scifi films smoke some dope and maybe youll like this one if you want to listen to 1970s pop music get a cassette tape such a disappointment wasted 2 hours of my life
