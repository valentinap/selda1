 many people justify jacksons drivel by saying that everyone interprets the books differently jackson however not only adapted tolkiens story but created his own he removed tolkiens dialogue and replaced it with hackneyed banter he replaced scenes of drama and suspense with slapstick and hamboning the majesty and dignity of characters such as gimli aragorn sam frodo gollum and theoden almost all the characters really are reduced to snivelling whimpering and slapstick jokes arwen elrond and galadriel the most noble characters in the series are reduced to whimpering fools the disrespect that jackson shows for the characters makes clear the lack of interest he has in faithfully presenting tolkiens work tolkien after all related to his characters so closely that he had their names engraved on his own tombstone it is insulting to tolkiens memory to deal with his characters with such irreverence considering how much he cared about them its insulting to tolkiens memory while many dispute this i find the movies to be amateurish and the special effects are mediocre considering the heights of computer generated effects that other studios have reacheddespite the rave reviews it gets making a mediocre movie isnt really a sin in itself making a bad movie and claiming that it has any relationship to tolkiens work however is movie gets one star out of ten but its more deserving of zero that people have read tolkiens book and yet find any similarity or value in jacksons movies baffles me they are without merit being poorly made and completely disrespectfully adapted from the books jackson has not merely spit on tolkiens grave he has forever tainted his legacy with his awful interpretation of his work
