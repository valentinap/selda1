 may spoil warning  i seen this in the theaters when it came out in 99 i payed $700 dollars to see it the second i found out the secret i wanted to beat someone up all right no plot plot dont make since if i was in a basement full of guys and had to watch someone abuse them self and they thought it was interesting i would exit as fast as i can i have to wright ten lines in order for me to be able to warn you that i dont even think this qualifies as a movie there is no plot or story that i can see making a movie about therese a point where his nonself shots a gun at him and blows out a van window so is the gun real is the bullet real did the window blow out or was that imagined
