hahahahhahahah this is the most original thing ive seen in the past years if only it were a comedyparody  thinking of it actually its funnier this way so nvm the comedyparody statement before i go on i have to say that ive never read green arrow but this is not the case here at all why its funny? for starters look at the review title this series is actually a soap opera everything about it is well with the exception that green arrow stars in it the directing is horrid so is the acting and the character lines the story looks ok and id really like to know how it unravels theres also hot women in it not something one wouldnt expect those last two facts are not enough for one to sit and watch it but theyre the reason why i rated with 310 and not 110 what i will do i propose you do the same is start reading the green arrow comic books and google for hot women instead of wasting my time watching this thing it was really fun hilarious tbh watching the first couple of episodes might be three cant recall but enough is enough next
