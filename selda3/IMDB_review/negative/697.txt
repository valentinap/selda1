a great film sorely let down by the ending i know jackson is only trying to stick to tolkiens version but the ending was unsuited for a film it just dragged on and on and on it really soured my experience of what otherwise was a great trilogy the interminable ending should have been resigned to a directors cut dvd version to satisfy tolkien fans the worst ending ever ai of course
