what could have been an engaging cross between james bond and marvel comics is marred by misplaced vulgarity overthetop gore and the ineptitude of samuel l jackson the premise of twentysomethings vying for a spot in a secret society of british super agents is promising but the storyline moves disjointedly between comedyadventure and pulp fictionlike violence colin firth shines as the veteran kingsman and taron egerton and sophie cookson are fine as kingsman candidates but jackson is a lame villain who doesnt have the charm or acting chops to fill his role a movie like this needs a hans gruber and jackson is no alan rickman kingsman the secret service is a good idea with the right script and a compelling villain it could have been much better
