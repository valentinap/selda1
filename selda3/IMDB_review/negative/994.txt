ok batman tdk is a good thriller worthing maybe a 7 out of 10 but is simply not conceivable that it is ranked more than masterpieces like the godfather and other wonderful pieces of art batman tdk is not a piece of art is just entertainment good entertainment even if the movie is a bit long the plot confused and sometimes non sense what about the logic of the ending mobile phone image scanningetc etc as other reviewers already commented the batman character voice is also pathetic with the forced laryngitis like tone do you want batman to talk like a 140 kg wrestling player nah those things may perhaps have impact on kids but look ridiculous to any other more mature audience heath ledgers performance is good in my opinion the best thing in this movie i liked his performance when the joker is coming out from the hospital before the explosion when he walked in a very strange psychotic way dressed like a nurse ahaha i liked his mimic i put 1 10 on this movie knowing that it deserves probably a 7 10 to reduce this insane over rating
