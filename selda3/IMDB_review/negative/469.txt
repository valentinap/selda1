grrrrr hollywood sticks a hunky actor in the lead spends zillions promoting it and slaps on the title to an old tv show that no one associated with it ever watched and americans line up like sheep to see it this film along with other blockbusters like the grinch make me ashamed of our film industrymaybe these films are why the french hate us so much hmmmmm some bozo script writer has the wonderful idea to make the bad guy jim phelps he or she remembers hearing the name somewhere and it has a nice ring to it it should you idiothe was the hero from the original series that everyone loved while youre at it why not remake some other old tv shows that feature barney the dinosaur as a child molester or santa claus as an alcoholic? ahhhhhhhh then after irritating all the old fans lets create the dumbest special effects ever and base the entire movie around explosions and stuntseven though the original series used these very sparingly my favorite example was the banal chase sequence there we see the macho tom cruise riding the skids of a helicopter suddenly it blows up and he blasts forward onto the train he is pursuing and lands expertly on the train if this were really attempted it would cost the lives of 67000000 stunt men to get this stunt right providing that the laws of physics no longer applied during the duration of the stunt then because this was such a cool stunt other pictures included very similar stunts for the next year or so i was half expecting to see it in the next elmo movie america wake upstop attending mindnumbing megabudget movies just because they are marketed to us at every turn pssince i first posted this review tom cruises stupid public statements make me wish i could rank the movie lower than a 1man i am getting sick of seeing this guy
