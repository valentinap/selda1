i went to this film and all i can say is it was the longest technical demonstration of bullshit i have ever seen im having a hard time writing about this film because i honestly wish i could forget about the film the film has its strong points and those are visually appealing cinematography and an impressive use of sound the negatives of this movie are however to many to put in a single review the film has an alright beginning and the build up of the characters is done pretty well and you get to see matthew mcconaughey do some wonderful acting however none of the characters were developed enough for you to care for them however the movie jumped around so much from plot to plot that your emotions got shocked when very predictably a character gets killed but then the story moves right along with a nice action scene thrown in to keep you awake the movie is full of quantum physics jargon that no one could possibly follow the jargon is about an hour of the movie and i have a fairly basic grasp on physics having taken a few college physics courses but i can say for a fact that many of the things might be true out of context but in the frame of the movie didnt make any sense im not writing anymore in this review i just recommend you go see another film it felt like a waste of a good night to me but judging by the reactions of all the people in my theater you will probably find it a confusing a deep trip into breath taking quantum physics induced acid trip
