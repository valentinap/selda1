this movie is a complete joke the only thing going for it is the visual effects in the 1959 disney classic maleficent is the mistress of evil and she was perfect in that role but in this nonsense movie she is a good person? her name does not seem good at all also i want to write in some details why i did not like this movie and why the story was very weak in my opinion first why is king stefan evil? why did he send aurora to live with the three fairies until she is 16? is he crazy? the curse stated that she will go into a sleep like death when she is 16 so why the hell will he send his daughter away all those years and never even visit her? he could have made her live with them until she is 16 and protected her in the castle or told the fairies to come and protect her on that day and coming to the fairies they portray them as idiots the good fairies are idiots? and prince philip is not the true love of aurora? what nonsense finally the motherly kiss of maleficent lifts the curse? she put it on in the first place and finally maleficent kills stefan auroras father and aurora is happy about that? what the hell? really a silly movie i gave it 210 just because of the cgi which hollywood seem to think that this will save all movies not good writing and casting
