better than woos sterile sequel but has the unmistakable stamp of de palmas illogic except this time it isnt so much illogic as total confusion for the viewer the plot twists and the conspiracy haze go quite far and it isnt long after one gives up in trying to understand who is doing what to whom for what reason the movie isnt boring ill give it that de palmas films are rarely boring however there is also a casting problem rhames  of all people  plays a computer expert a hacker no less this is absolutely ridiculous then we have the old and nearly fat jon voight karatechopping the young james bondtype tom cruise character even more absurd voights wife is emmanuelle beart these two are as convincing a pair as bob dole and britney spears would be the action sequences with the helicopter are wooesquire cruise blows up the chopper and the explosion throws him  unharmed  onto the train which is going at around 200 kmh and then a part of the chopper fails to impale him by a mere millimeter these scenes were truly prophetic because woo  the king of absurdist action scenes  took over in the sequel beart comes complete with a set of fake breasts and an upper lip so pumped up with silicone or whatever it is they inject there that her mouth is perpetually pursed to kiss someone
