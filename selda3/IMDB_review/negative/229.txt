okay from where do i start? first when i heard ben affleck was in it something told me movie would suck & it seems my inner voice was right lol at first movie seems weird no intense moments nothing like that i keep watching in hope something interesting comes but in vain its just so dead empty & jumbled that lacks everything oh by the way there are lots of mistakes im not going to mention all but a few for example she is interviewed at the hospital were she arrived covered in blood telling the story that she was raped and nobody cleans the blood of her in the hospital and she is in a room with lots of cops plus husband lawyer etc etc then she leaves with her husband that was accused of murder and they go home together its just an enormous junk heap of illogical and nonsense movie oh and movie is so stretched its 230 minutes of boring uninteresting & unrealistic plot its as bad as finchers fight club which is another overrated piece of junk just avoid this movie do no waste your time on it
