this was one turkey of a sci fi this is my report near the beginning of the movie a family gets a flat tire in the dustbowl corn fields of any midwestern alternate reality the dad is played by mud and in his alternate world he hangs a 90 and does like seventy through the corn without the slightest bump all the while deftly hacking his laptop to commandeer a nearby drone after stealing the drone mud decides that he must leave his kids to prove to their uppity teacher that nasa really did go to the moon he is chosen by alfred to blast off with catwoman in a reasonably 20th century 3stage rocket that will eventually dock with an incredibly advanced 22nd century space stationrocketship after leaving earth they need no longer adhere to primitive earth technology now they can do anything that already ever happened on star trek including cryosleep when they wake up feeling refreshed they head for a cool wormhole that stanley and alfred told them about they are hoping to find a new planet for all the okies to go to at least thats plan a there is a plan b but its sub pc and is not going to work for mud who is all about hurrying on up back to earth so he can save everyone gotta say more here about muds robot chum as he is remarkable with a fingerprint smeared body consisting of multiple swinging hvac ducts that can navigate through zero gravity run across boulder fields and even walk on water not to mention rescue damsels while carrying on charming banter with a voice socially engineered to be annoying after they go through the wormhole they go to a waterworld where the laws of physics need not apply each hour they spend is equal to 17 years on earth wheres einstein when you need him? the whole planet is covered with 3 feet of water which is fortunate since catwoman cant swim back on earth the dispossessed are aging rapidly with their oldschool monster trucks and other quaint artifacts of 20th century dustbowl arkansas muds kids get growed up and environmentally challenged but its really about how mud abandoned them eventually mud and catwoman go to a really crappy planet that seems even worse than dustbowl earth yet they feel hopeful that they might move their famblys there perhaps down under the frozen ammonia glaciers they find a sinister guy who looks like matt damons dad who gets all evil and blows stuff up mud decides that hes gonna take the tin man and fly into the nearbye black hole that is just 14 billion light years away mudbot knows in his crazybrilliant hillbillysage way that if he just makes a bline through the bhole he is going to pop the cherry with hans zimmer in the house mud trips his way through the fivedimensional space after an abbreviated acid trip thanks kubrick thanks trumbull mud skips the room with the old man and starts floating around in an empty library he peers through the stacks at his pastlife capers while pondering the tangled twists which makes him feel real sad and then he feels real mad and yells at his little daughter who cant even hear him if only he could communicate using just his sheer acting meanwhile muds grownup daughter on earth also feels sad and mad and she tells her brother to argo f himself for not joining her in her cave she doesnt like the air quality either so she torches her bros corn crop harsh then she starts moping around in the old family library the very same one that mud is trapped behind the stacks in except muds library is made by humans from the future at least thats what the robot said suddenly while pondering a wristwatch big daughter has an epiphany and realizes that all you really need is€ € wait for it€ gravity lots of good opportunities to cry here what with mud screaming at the little and big version of his daughter and having epiphanies right and left something no idea what clicks and mud tells the robot to get binary and convert the quantum data into morse code so that he can poweremote it to the wristwatch that daughter is trippin on wait did she just hallucinate? or did the little minute hand start jiggling around? it did do a jiggly wiggly and the jiggles are obviously coded gravitysignal wiggles coming through the blackhole bookshelf world from her crazy hicksavant dad well that about wraps it up needless to say big daughter transcodes the quantum jiggles into fortran code and saves the world or at least makes it a lot less dusty and so that people get to go to hawaii again years later the big daughter becomes really ancient daughter and cryonaps in the hope of seeing mud again darned if some of the freshly quantum jiggled peoples dont figure out how to make space rockets again and they even find mud just in time so that he can come back and be ignored by everybody he saved apparently the robot ran off with catwoman so ancient daughter wakes up and figures it is just so much easier to go to saturn with her tube and her hospital bed a bunch of other family members go with her just for convenience sake and they all gather around her bed when mud comes in they decide to walk out en masse without even glancing at mud even though he is their great granpappy and saved the world and discovered quantum gravity love more sweet sweet tears as dad and daughter commiserate after an appropriate interval daughter wisely tells daddy to go and enjoy his youth steal a spaceship and try and win catwoman back from the swinging robot
