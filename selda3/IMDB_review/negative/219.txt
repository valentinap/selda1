one of the worst movies ever painful for ridiculously drugged out people or those lacking any knowledge whatsoever take your pick overacted and pretentious moronic actors using big words with a total lack of understanding of what they mean i never want to see anne hathaway again ever i only want to see mcconaughey was even worse if that is possible i feel sorry for the actors who played small parts in this movie i formerly had respect for most of them some of the pictures were pretty cool too bad the dialog didnt rise to the level of the cinematography but neither did the storyline the characters were not fully developed in the story it was silly
