 sorry folksthis one gets the one star it is a great movie but the fact that it is number one on imdb is just an outrage i think one of the other posters on here said it best let me clear this if a movie can bring freshness to creativity if a movie happens to change your insights if a movie starts a new genre gives away new techniques and styles if a movie makes you understand your heart better then i call that movie a masterpiece as far as i see the dark knight is far from it heath ledger was the only phenomenal actor this movie is unoriginal end of story
