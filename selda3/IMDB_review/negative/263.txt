listen im not a smart man but i have basic reasoning skills and common sense now whilst i understand that scifiction doesnt follow the rules of reality suspension of disbelief and all there still has to be coherency rules and order however fantastical within the made up world so that people buy into the movie this movie lacks those attributes in spades and is a bitch slap to the viewers intelligence in one snippet of the three hour nonsense youll endure and i do mean endure the intrepid saviors of the world decide to check out a water planet because their predecessor sent a beacon that this was a viable planet for new earth but within minutes of their landing on two inches of water they realize that a giant wave had smashed their scout to bits promptly after she landed years before and they were about to suffer the same fate but oh happy day they manage to escape wasting only a few hours of their time but decades of earth time well that sucks but it makes sense that they had to check it out right? not when you realize they could have avoided the watery planet from hell if the first scout hadnt sent out a beacon saying the planet was viable in the first place after all how could she know that in the mere minutes between when she landed and was then smashed to bits?? nice to know that when the fate of mankind is in the balance a responsible scientist would jump to such a rushed conclusion hey guys i just landed here looks great come now xoxo then you have another scientist on another planet who was supposedly selflessly brave enough to go on a oneway trip to scout a planet then chicken shis out when he gets there and realizes its not viable and hes a dead man so selfishly dooms mankinds one chance by having them waste their limited resources to get there just to unwittingly rescue him but then decides he can still save mankind by killing his rescuers so that he can complete the mission all by himself holy whiplash with his conflicting moralitiesimmoralities batman i could go on and on but i wont i conclude by saying it really irks me when a movie like this gets lauded as a masterpiece when its really just acid tripping rubbish
