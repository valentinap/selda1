it sucked big time spoiler at least one of the midgets should have died nothing worthy of a message in thinking that luck will get you to your goals and other people will have to pay for your incompetence the movie is excruciating and super long most overrated franchise of all time why does any character has to cry that much on a non drama flick i miss rudy playing semi tough roles i cant believe the so called weighted average allows all the fat misfits to place every geeky franchise of films inside the top 250 its pretty frustrating and disappointing any movie that has any association with comic con should automatically receive 2 or 3 full points decrease out of the score i think thats it dont watch this movie or anything from the franchise and specifically get away of the lord of the rings prequels that are even slower with half the battles and boring
