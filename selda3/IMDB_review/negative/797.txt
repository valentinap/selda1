i just dont get it its not that i think this is an awful movie or anything but no2 look at the rest of the movies in the top 10 does it really stand comparison with the godfather or seven samurai i think not its a manipulative sentimental sunday afternoon movie raised above b standard by some quality turns by talented actors nothing more and who cares whether andy could put the poster back in place or not its a patently ridiculous escape to begin with i understand that most of the people on this site will have a pop at me for being a snob but the fact is i love star wars and lord of the rings and other blockbuster movies but if youre looking for a genuinely affecting drama this doesnt cut the mustard sorry guys but youre all wrong
