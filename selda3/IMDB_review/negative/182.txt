spoiler? just describing the first scene i sit down with my ten year old expecting to be entertained heard so much about this movie its this generations star wars right? first scene a tragic heartjerker that kills off the kids mother what the  who asked for this? i hold my kids hand and we plunge on then a bunch of running around and dumb violence about the time somebody for some reason who claims his father had been killed and his grandfather takes a big hammer and smashes someones head so blood can trickle down into this reservoir my kid and i looked at each other and said are you enjoying this at all? of course not so we left maybe it gets fun and charming after half an hour but honestly this is todays entertainment???
