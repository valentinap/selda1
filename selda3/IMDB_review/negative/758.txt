i decided to watch this trilogy with a completely open mind to see what the fuss was all about i was rather embarrassed by the fact that i had never seen any of these movies which were heralded as great cinematic classics instead of the masterpiece i was promised however i was left with a great mediocrity the characters were barely 2 dimensional the plot was riddled with holes and horribly rushed and the dialogue was cheesy episode v was perhaps the least painful to watch but still isnt close to being good i dont know if its a case of a movie aging very badly but i cant for the life of me understand the allure of it to each their own i guess
