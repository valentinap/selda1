brainless movie tries to make a point but comes across only as a cinematic failure a total waste of time which is sad given the admittedly quality performances yet asinine script the first third is promising but ultimately this mess of a picture only goes downhill with each brainless sequence that follows after this picture ended i wanted to erase it from my mind reviews on this site are typical of the below 20 group who like quick editing and dumbed down plots that have a secret message overall rating bomb remember the first rule of fight club is dont see fight club
