** minor spoiler ** i was really looking forward to this film i like movies and i like science fiction i like most of christopher nolans films and i think matthew mcconaughey has done some great acting work true detective for example so the film seemed to have all the ingredients that would make it enjoyable sadly though i found it to be a disappointment i think there are three reasons for this first and foremost i did not make any emotional connection with the characters matthew was supposed to be the hero and protagonist of the film but i didnt connect to him at all other characters eg the daughter the grown up son the matt damon character i found irritating regardless of the subject matter of a film i need to emotionally connect with the characters in some way secondly there were too many basic plot points that made no common sense im not talking about the science not making science sense as thats accepted and okay in a science fiction film *** spoiler next** for example matthew mcconaughey turns up at the nasa base and without any credible explanation is told hell be the pilot of the space ship?**spoiler ends** thirdly i think in attempt to make a serious weighty science fiction film with gravitas the entire tone of the film became too unremittingly seriousand they omitted to lighten the mood occasionally with a bit of appropriate humour take as a comparison the shawshank redemption which currently tops imdbs greatest movie poll a great film with gravitas and a serious message often emotionally dark and harrowing at timesbut it uses humour appropriately to balance the tone of the overall film so very sadly a real disappointment im afraidand i find myself genuinely puzzled why this film has got such a high imdb ratingin exactly the same way and same reasons that i was puzzled by the high rating for skyfall
