ill start by saying upfront i was only able to tolerate about 15 minutes of the movie being a primarily marvel comic book reader and tv showcartoon viewer since the mid70s im dont care too much for comic book movies as they are not as interesting as or true to the comic book so yes i started watching with a bias but three successive clichs in the first 15 minutes were immediate strike outs for me 01 the dancing to soundtrack while you work scene 02 perfect fighting and comical acrobatics scene 03 the hey thats my property youre impounding give it back scene never mind the overuse of the charm and whimsy of an cgi space raccoon paired with the comic relief of a cgi walking talking catchphrase spewing tree or the deliberate use of a song hit soundtrack etcyawn i think you get the point imo the best comic book movie thus far is watchmen and i dont even read or care for dc comics and no i never read any guardians of the galaxy comics either the movie would have been better done as a cartoon or all cgi
