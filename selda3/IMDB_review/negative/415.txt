i had my doubts before but now i am sure if it disney has sold out recently disney has been releasing films that whether the public chooses to acknowledge it or not have been paintbynumbers at best films like the lone ranger thor the dark world and frozen yes frozen its the same disney crap youve seen over and over people dont get me wrong i love disney but not this disney one that would butcher one of its own beloved fairy tales to make a quick buck yes you heard right disney did stoop that low i should have known that this film would be garbage from the getgo when they hired alice in wonderland writer melissa woolverton to pen the screenplay and alice in wonderland production designer robert stromberg to direct are you sensing a pattern here? lets touch on that for a moment the mouse house in its infinite wisdom got a production designervfx supervisor who had never directed anything to direct their $200 million blockbuster as a result maleficents beautiful visuals carry no weight and the actors for the most part seem utterly lost because what the hell would a set designer know about directing actors? even angelina jolie cant pull off her real emotional scenes because she is left to direct herself what really sank this movie for me was disney blatantly ripping themselves off and using the true love twist from frozen literally the exact same twist i have no problem with disney creating a strong independent heroine but if youre going to do that dont have your heroine wear a skintight leather black cat suit in the climax of your movie in short disney has definitely lost its magic and its going to be tough to get it back dont listen to the positive reviews remember how glowing alice in wonderlands were when it first came out? you have been warned
