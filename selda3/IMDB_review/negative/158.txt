the life of a young man mason from age 5 to age 18 where the actors ellar coltrane patricia arquette ethan hawke played the film in real time so it took 13 years to make one of the few films i have ever walked out on the others were in disgust but this one i left due to pure boredom one hour into the film and there had been only 5 minutes of drama then the film was back to documenting the boring fictional life of a boring fictional family now the whole idea of actors who age naturally with the film could have been interesting but the director completely pooched this fantastic opportunity by slavishly doing the film chronologically and slooooooowly instead of mixing it up a bit and showing us the boys life at 6 then at 18 then back to 15 but instead year trailed after year and after an hour i really felt like i had lived through those first few years in real time too so here is my list of things that are more fun that watching boyhood  cleaning your gutters did that earlier today and found a frog that was more exciting  waiting in the waiting room of the dentist at least there is some suspense  getting your teeth drilled by the dentist at least you feel something  a good bowel movement the smell only lasts a few minutes not three hours i could obviously continue but you get the drift this film is the ultimate triumph of style over substance nice idea technically totally forgettable as a film
