i have seen a lot of movies made from computer programs lara croft etc however this computer generated cartoon beats them all no nobody really gave a great performance individually or they would have got a nomination and won it no doubt but the graphics oh man they almost looked like a real movie being shot moreover the special effects were incredible i can see why this movie won seven oscars for special effects alone i mean you have to give it to this movie it had some great special effects oh sure the acting was overdone and a bit sappy but man get a look at the special effects here i mean it won 11 oscars so i guess it must be the best film ever even though nobody from the film was acknowledged for their performance because nobody was really great in it but man the special effects here outstanding hey a billion geeks cant be wrong
