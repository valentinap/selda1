i read some opinions from different users before watching the movie and even got excited about the idea of paying my entrance for guardians of the galaxy but was absolutely disappointed because what i found was once again as many major blockbusters do a weak plot and lots of action scenes without an strong story behind and when a movie lacks an story it feels like an amount of nonsense battles and a compendium of action heroes against bad guys i really like the characters of the film but the quality of a movie cannot rely on the strenght of undeveloped characters star wars is still ligth years ahead from these guardians sorry waste of money and time
