i love dramatic movies i love scifi movies i love most of christopher nolans work i was so excited to see interstellar after all the 1010 reviews but after seeing it i was thoroughly disappointed my actual rating is probably 610 i rated 110 to balance the other ratings spoilers ahead here are my major problems with this movie 1over dramatized effects throughout 2every character except for 3 of them was just a redshirt with no characterization just created to be killed off 3the science aspect was stupid especially in the second half 4did this highly developed 5d race have any way to save humans besides creating a room that a guy would go to to tell himself to go there so that he could send binary through a watch to his daughter that is older than he is? 5the ending was a thorough disappointment everything was happy dandy and the whole human race was saved just because of data from a black hole? they never explain why that data is even useful 6poorly designed and explained apocalypse earth didnt seem to be in much peril 7okay when mann blew the airlock couldnt the others just tell him that it would blow up half the ship instead of saying dont do it its not the right decision 8really? the voice of corruption is called mann? that was a stupid metaphor 9i dont think there was even enough water on millers planet to make waves those big seeing as it wasnt even knee deep 10just wasnt what it was cracked up to be the film was heavily lacking in character development and plot the science aspect was unbelievable and stupid parts that i liked no it didnt all suck 1tarz was pretty cool he was unique compared to all other robots from scifi movies ive seen 2the highly dramatized parts would have been good in moderation and there were some good special effects 3i didnt fall asleep which is good i just cant believe so many people are raving over this movie its like theyre too dumb to see past special effects and blaring music to see that the movie itself wasnt any good people try to tell me the science in this movie couldve made sense because its not discovered yet i think a planet with alien dinosaurs who speak english would have been more believable its worth seeing so you can realize how wrong everyone is but dont expect too much
