spoilers i sacrificed myself by entering a black hole in my spacesuit endured a lsd trip of love to send you this singular message not for me but for the good of mankind this is a movie which literally gets worse by the minute should your cinema be graceful and insert a break use it get out the rest of this thing will seem to last 7 years youll probably realized the heartwarming end to it already anyway apparently mankind was able to master robotics and an ai worthy of star trek but still uses current spaceships except when they dont somewhat later cause you know it just wouldnt have worked with all that landing and launching on other planets also it wouldnt have been impossible to send probes to the planets because  well that wasnt in the script either it was however possible to think that a planet orbiting a gigantic black hole so close to its event horizon that one hour stretches to seven years might be a hospitable place to found a new civilization apart from all that nonsense reality like being sucked into it or getting grilled by gamma rays so i have wasted several hours and even some minutes more to write this but if it saves one soul from enduring this
