save yourself the time with this one unless your less than about 12 years old or have a very low iq its like the ideas been pieced together from other shows its stupid inconsistent hypocritical ridiculous and most of the acting is terrible its a pity because the underlying story with the mother and her associates is the shows only redemption you just have to sit through the agony of the rest of the show to get this maybe they should save us all the heartache and just tell us what happens with that story line
