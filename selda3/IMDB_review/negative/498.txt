convoluted dialogue wooden performances and a surprise to see zoe saldana and particularly glenn close in such dross i can only surmise they needed the moneyno character development to speak of except for that of the raccoon that cgid fellow actually showed more acting chops and skill than any of the human cast im a huge fan of marvel and its always a shame to see a thing done badly there was no energy the pace was laboured staggered it just lacked rhythm as a side note the rating this film has received is a travesty i must assume people are not watching movies they are rating i understand everyones tastes are different but really 8 stars i wouldnt by the dvd wait until it hits terrestrial if you must see it but definitely dont pay good money to view this film
