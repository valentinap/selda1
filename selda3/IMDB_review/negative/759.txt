however the real acting triumph of the film is elijah wood as frodo baggins he continues his descent into corruption with an incredible talent that many could not pull off woods performance is so critical to the film because it determines the rings power to corrupt which needless to say is absolute the first two films established jackson as an incredible visionary shooting vast landscapes from his native new zealand with return of the king jackson really gets a chance to show off with hands down the most beautiful visuals of the trilogy jackson makes return of the king a gorgeous feast for the eyes while never resorting to mcg level over the topless jackson stays very grounded in his characters not letting the effects tell the story but only assist the wonderful dialog and characters think of return as a mix of fellowship and two towers with enough action and character development worthy of ending a film event of this magnitude the bottom line fans of the films will not be disappointed hardcore tolkien lovers might be upset by plot changes and interpretations made by jackson and the other writers however it is unrealistic to expect a completely true adaptation of the novels being that film is an entirely different medium despite the alterations jackson consistently stays true to the major themes and ideas from the original text while adding some of the finest film making ever put to screen the lord of the rings the return of the king is one of the most finely tuned and cinematically perfect films ever made not only the best of the trilogy but a crowning achievement in epic film making
