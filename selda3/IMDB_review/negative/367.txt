i usually dont write these reviews but i am so antiinspired and this way would like to warn people if you dont like first 10 mins everything later will be even worse i thought that skyline is worst movie ever but after watching this one i am really not sure the plot doesnt lead anywhere almost all characters have horrible personalities they are absolutely stupid and not capable to to lead their lives scenes are lasting too long and for many i find no reason of including them to the movie the movie lasts too long and it is so frustrating and irritating that after watching it you realised it was total waste of time just dont make the same mistake
