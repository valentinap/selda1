i saw this film at the cinerama dome on sunset strip in hollywood when it was first released i am upset with myself for not walking out in the middle and demanding my money back i stayed and gave it a chance to my utter dismay this foul piece of crap is one of the worst films i have ever seeni get more pleasure out of deliberately bad films like  plan 9 from outer space  fight club  actually masquerades as something artistic meatloaf discarded any dignity or selfrespect he might possess by accepting this pathetic roleaside from the sick i dont mean the current vernacular premise and the idiotic plot the fact that morons are out there now beating the hell out of each other in basements as a form of mimicry and tribute is disgusting to mean abomination of a movie
