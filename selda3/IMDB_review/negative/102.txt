this is a truly awful movie that cannot be related to on any level a total waste of a famous cast what an absurd story a dying man uploads his mind onto a computer then some nonsensical fighting ensues between those who are for and against such things johnny depp doesnt need to do such bad movies stoned faced performance by the way rebecca hall too unattractive for the lead female morgan freeman needs to display some selectiveness cillian murphy and paul bettany dont know what you were fighting for this type of bad sci fi rubbish has got to stop it deserves to be forgotten like it was never made at all makes inception seem logical by comparison
