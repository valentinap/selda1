i really cant believe that this movie has such a high rating in imdb generally movies above 8 should be a must see ones and this one fails big time in the must see list if you are for a mindless action movie with some bond lines from the 80s yes this is something that you will enjoy if however you want to see something enjoyable with nice humor and an actual interesting plot then please dont watch this one youll definitely waste your time what you get here is something that you know the end in the first 5 minutes i mean come on the struggle to be accepted in the high society and the movies about it was a hit 30 years ago if you have money or you are a clever person then you will be welcomed everywhere in the world also the jokes are flat and you have to be 15 years old to actually laugh all in all you get a lousy plot with lousy lines and a soso action with some cgi effects thanks but no thanks
