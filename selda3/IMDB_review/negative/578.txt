havent seen it but i know its crap the popularity of this movie and its director invalidates the claim that its iconoclastic any movie that is this popular is false opposition period you think a major movie studio would finance something that truly threatened the establishment the passion of the christ was a truly iconoclastic movie it scared the crap out of the establishment which is primarily jewish and masonic which is why the talmudists in hollywood went after gibson with all their force you can also tell a lot about a movie based on its fans ive never encountered anyone who likes this movie who isnt a poseur usually young white dorky guys
