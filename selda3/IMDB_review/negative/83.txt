this movie has an agenda and to entertain is not it first off the first third of the movie was about how man has destroyed the earth and we who are left all live in a remake of the dust bowl days with what i assume was actual dust bowl survivors testifying in the movie about how bad it was when a movie puts in crap that jerks you out of the moment and then makes you try to figure out if its really part of the movie or did you wander into a ken burns documentary your in trouble with trying to be entertained and propaganda is on the way we have to find a new world to live on and there has been some unknown intelligent and i say that only because that is what the movie portrays it to be unlike the director and writers beings that through gravity have given clues or some type of morse code through gravitational binary code to draw scientist attention to the worm hole opened up to a new part of the universe the second part of the movie and agenda driven plot is about how man needs to keep spending money on going to the moon space and beyond anyone who thinks it was a waste is deemed an idiot as in the movie where the school board rewrites the school books saying that the moon landings were faked the last bit deals with time relativity and and while exploring the new earth time goes at 7 years to one hour so when mathew mcconaughey comes home his 10 yo daughter is now dying in bedonly to chase him out of the room then there are the million questions that dont add up there is no army any more lol like a world of drought and no or little food only corn would not have riots and other hostile countries trying to take what we had mcconaughy is drinking beer in the fist part of the movie where the hell did the barley or wheat come from if they only have corn and where did nasa come from in the middle of a corn field if there is no us government to build all this crap? its a known fact that the scientists at nasa built not a darn thing nor ever have its all those corporations that get the contracts to build everything from the pencils the geeks use to the launch vehicles and produce the fuel to move them nasa does not so much as put one bolt in one hole micheal cains character ages some 25 give or take years and he does not look any different than he did at the beginning damn that geritol is working good this movies is flat and leaves you disgusted much like contact you will learn to swear after leaving if you dont know it will only be loved by the geeks who love anything with a spaceship in it and dont care or understand content or plot and by the hippie eco nuts who want to use it to push the idea we have to ban oil and hummers do not waste your hard earned money on this loser
