its not a science fiction movie  its  um i really dont know how to classify it other than its full of itself ive watched every science fiction showmovie out there and if youre like me you will be mad after watching this movie you can make a movie if your premise is right for science fiction movies and or shows if you explain the science in a believable way even though its not physically possible you have a chance at making a half decent science fiction movie you can use outrageous theories or whatever to show whats happening on film might be possible well winterstellar they dont even bother to do that and if they have some explanation to their science its like they just got some scientific words and strung them together to make a sentence if you like star trekany of them tv spin offs or movies star wars babylon 5 battle star doctor whoold or new and even 2001 space odysseyboring but well made considering when it was made take my advice and stay away you will loose 3hrs of your life the worst part is you wont be able to explain anything about the movie because it simply makes no sense
