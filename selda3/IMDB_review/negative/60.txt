this really is an extremely poor film by any standards obviously paid contributors have boosted its score to ridiculous levels memento was absolutely brilliant but christopher nolans films from then on have got worse and worse a distinct case of the emperors new clothes inception was a sheer disaster with loads of holes in plot and characterisation but this lacks any interesting plot or characters whatsoever for a start it is obvious that nolan went to see 2001  a space odyssey when he was younger and has been dreaming about remaking it and taking it further um well messrs clarke and kubrick made a better job of it thats the end of the film written off  dont pay attention to the very last fifteen minutes it is an embarrassment except for the star wars imagery the main plot is mankind is doomed and only a mission to outer space through a wormhole can save us a few films have done this better there is no money for space exploration apparently but nobody notices numerous rockets being fired into space please when the mission lands on one of the selected planets the plot comes close to utter stupidity trying to resemble total recall and it does not get any better as we rerun gravity and 2001 before the starchild repeat plot goes even more haywire then there is so much mumbo jumbo that one loses interest entirely the space sequences unfortunately have been trumped by gravity so the spectacle is empty and ungripping the actors try but who cares about such an overhyped unbelievable piece of twaddle and s a note to mr nolan jnr  go and watch shane if you want to make a movie about love and family otherwise give us all a rest from your illconceived socalled masterpieces
