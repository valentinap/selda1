just saw the movie and wasnt a fan interesting premise but i felt some moments it tried to be funny tried to be over the top or even tried to be serious without being interesting it was if the movie was written for specific fight scenes and then pieced together in a rush recommend as a rental but even then it should be low on the list the others i went with had similar opinions with only the argument of which was worse this or jupiter ascending having only seen this one i am rating it a 4 because of the decent acting cool villain and good score
