the movie starts off with some interesting dialog but it quickly falls apart and becomes unwatchable some people apparently found it clever to tell the movies stories out of chronological order in fact it undercut any feelings one could have for the characters and made the movie far more tedious then it had to be the first half is merely dull and boringthen it becomes ugly gross vicious and disgusting it ends up being forgettable and sickening out of the 50000 movies and 50000 television episodes i have seen in my life this would rank about #8 in the 10 worst needless to say i have never bothered to see a tarentino movie after this one
