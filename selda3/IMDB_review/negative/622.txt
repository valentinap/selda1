quite unfortunate i respect most of the people in this movie and they do show some good acting chops in this movie unfortunately its a pale screenplay directed with no distinction ed norton had already done a brilliant movie about fascistwannabes with american x so what was the point of getting involved in this mess norton deserved better as did pitt bonhamcarter and leto sad  i was hoping for a meditation for modern life and the culture of violence i guess ill just have to go back to american history x and natural born killers
