the beginning of the movie was okay and the back story was understandable however trying to make the villain of a classic disney movie into a good guy is infuriating i understand how the directors wanted to make a change but why? there is no point in making a huge change in a classic disney movie for example prince phillip was not at the ceremony as a boy defeating the whole purpose of the main highlight song i know you once upon a dream which did not happen in the movie they met of him asking for directions another thing the fairies flaura fauna and maryweather in the original movie were at least somewhat responsible but in this movie they were the most stupid dimsighted caretakers ive ever seen in the movie they didnt even cast the names not to mention the hilarious cakedress scene they made for auroras 16th birthday aurora never dances with philip which again defeats the whole purpose of the true loves kiss speaking of which the whole true loves kiss scene never happens which makes me want to rip hair out of my head its the whole point of sleeping beauty the whole castle never falls asleep and maleficent awakes aurora with a true loves kiss what? maleficent never turns into a dragon which was the best part of the original movie where the prince slays the evil fairy and saves the princess thats what we want to see basically the only good thing about the movie were the special effects and cgi other than that the whole movie was disappointing
