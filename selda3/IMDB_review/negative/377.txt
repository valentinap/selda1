i saw the trailer and the science of interstellar on youtube and i felt compelled to watch the movie oh boy the movie was such a disappointment there no respect for science in interstellar the movie is a waste of time and money it was without logic and too long i dont understand how such an awful movie can have 910 stars its beyond my comprehension the music is to loud and for nothing there is no real tension after reading the 1010 reviews i felt compelled to register an account on imdb to say how awful the movie was stay way please or youll regret it from now on i will never rely on imdb reviews when it comes to decide what to watch imdb you disappointed me
