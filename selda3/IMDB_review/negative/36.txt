watching boyhood there was nothing to keep me interested i like slow movies in general but if a movie is not exciting it should have interesting characters or good acting or clever writing or perceptive ideas or an intriguing atmosphere or beautiful cinematography or emotional scenes or at the very least make the viewer feel like they are in good company boyhood has none of that it feels long and boring the acting is very wooden the lead seems to have an extremely limited emotional range he can play vaguely amused to mildly irritated and thats about it he even seems to get worse as an actor as he gets older theres no character progression for the main people the lead starts off as a lazy boy and grows into a lazy adult his parents change a bit i suppose but not in a hugely insightful way his dad starts off a transient and ends up settling down inspirational his mom apparently needs a masters degree in order to get a job and begins and ends her scenes in the movie in fits of unhappiness how is she going to find meaning in her life? no one really cares did anyone actually write a script for this film? i know that it supposed to be like real life man but even then it fails two drunken stepfathers? isnt one enough? that mexican guy who because of one patronizing remark from the mom suddenly becomes the manager of a fancy restaurant? even the main guy looked unconvinced in that scene real life has bumps and curve balls dark nights of the soul and moments of extreme beauty and joy in real life people have to deal with hard choices and other people tell stories about these choices called movies with little things called plots and character arcs a deliberately mundane film like boyhood demeans the whole art form of filmmaking whats even scarier is that most people like it
