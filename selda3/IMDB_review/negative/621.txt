on one level this movie entertains making you laugh with sharp and witty dialogue irony and utter insanity of the plot on another level as a film  as art it fails miserably this is the kind of movie you should watch with a relative detachment because theres no reason to actually delve into the philosophy the point of the movie if there is one is simply to entertain the audience if the directorscreenwriterproducercast meant it to be deeper it got lost in the parody i will admit that i was very entertained by the performances of all the leads and even meat loaf was fun to watch in his small role however this does not make up for the fact that fight club tries to play with your mind and give a new spin on random subjects like mass media masculinityviolence and society when in fact it spreads itself too thin and through the conclusion of the movie completely sullies whatever decent arguments it had bottom line watch it for pure fun no more there is no hidden treasure here
