3 hours of senseless drivel that is what i sat through when i watched interstellar the acting wasnt anything special but the screenplay it had to be among the worst three that i have ever sat through in fact i was close to walking out of it had it not been for the laughing in a scifi film like this the expected reaction was far from the real one instead of a gripping edgeofyourseat effect the screenplay and plot holes were so ridiculously bad that myself and a few other cinemagoers were in stitches laughing like prometheus but somehow worse this film had the adverse effect of inducing laughter in anybody who wasnt blinded by the interplanetary special effects in almost all scifi films there is an enormous twist in the plot or story that will strive to inspire a gasp in viewers some rare films have this effect with an excellently crafted twist not this time the twist in this film was again so extraordinarily awful badly thoughtout and farfetched dont get me wrong these films have the right to go more farfetched than any film has travelled before but this one was just plain bad i had to shout out come on when the credits began to roll inspiring a few more laughs there from viewers in agreement even here at at the end there were still unanswered questions that were to be solved at some point in the course of the film with its mediocre acting awful plot vexingly atrocious twist underdeveloped characters entrusting a savethehumanrace mission to a semirandom trespasser  hellooo??? and boring disposition throughout save your money and head to something  anything  else
