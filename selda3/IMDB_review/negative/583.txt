i agree completely with the negative critics statements on the inside of the dvd this movies defenders have tried to pass it off as cerebral and psychological on this very page and as a profound portrait of how corporations ruin our lives it is none of these first of all what makes people think its cerebral the endless whining the laughable were all the middle children of history attempts at philosophizing the hardly novel idea that men need to have an outlet for their pentup aggression and the leftist idea which has been out there since at least the time of marx that corporations have been destroying our lives and screwing us over praise the movie as cerebral and youd better be cerebral yourself to recognize it get yourself a book of dostoyevsky or kant and see how you handle real deep thought second off that its psychological simple because the main character has a certain mental disorder i wont be so bad to reveal what it is is it psychological after we see the characters illness in the movie it seemed to me norton fighting pitt was like a bad candid camera joke i was halfexpecting the director to come on after the scene and say you took that scene seriously sucker its amazing what this movie expects you to believe particularly after the plot twist which like the usual suspects to which it has been often compared is just too clever by a half and voids entire sections of the movie im a fan of ed norton because i like his work i also liked seven quite a bit so i can hardly be dismissed as a fincherhater and i still agree that men in our society are fundamentally demasculinized in a way previous generations never had to deal with but after seeing this movie i think the solution may be worse than the cure
