the marvel team has once again given us another bunch of junk the ever growing marvel cinematic universe deserves to be destroyed and i found myself rooting for the bad guys to put the rest of the sappy characters out of their misery james gunn takes the helm of the fairly unknown guardians of the galaxy much to his detriment unlike iron man captain america and thor join this film as partners in grime an unmitigated disaster total junk a complete waste of time and utterly forgettable stay home and watch friends reruns they are more creative and still more relevant than this unimaginative unoriginal mishmash of plagiarized elements from other films ugghhhh
