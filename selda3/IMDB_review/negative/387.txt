i really dont see how everyone is giving such great reviews of this movie its one giant plot hole from which no stars can escape say what you like about nolans film making style but this movie should have never been made throughout the overly long self indulgent piece of crap i said many times that this movie had better end really well of course its just one notch above the worst ending i can think of for it i think they killed all the consultants off before they started filming too just save yourselves run dont watch it
