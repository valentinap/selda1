the movie was horrible i saw it because i was chaperoning four thirteen year old girls who were dying to see it the whole theater was full of a similar group sex and age subpar acting very idiotic main story a complete waste of time and money there is really no much more to be said perhaps i am not in the demographic for the book and movie i am over forty years old but i could not wait for it to finish to go home and spit the mouthful of puke i was holding please take my advise and spare yourself the suffering of this i sacrificed myself for you and i have come to advise you from your future not to fall as i did
