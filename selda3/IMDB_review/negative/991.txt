ill give the dark knight 1 out of 10 stars just so that its rating on the website will go down because it doesnt deserve to be anywhere on the top 250 list its incredible that heath ledgers acting carried the entire movie on its feet while the rest of the cast tries to entertain us with mediocre acting plain action scenes bad screen writing and the worst batman of all the movies christian bail with all his terrible speech impediments i wouldnt think twice to consider this a film the original tim burton version is a film its sequel is a film but christopher nolan puts a horrid scratch in the line of movies the dark knight with its mediocre plot character development story acting exception of course for heath ledger just makes for a not so epic movie only worthy of a 6 out of 10 rating the dark knight sucks you dont understand film if you think this mess is an exceptional piece of cinema and i hope that daniel day lewis will turn down the joker roll for the next movie theyre getting the best actor possible to play the joker hoping that hell do the same as heath did score 500 million in the box office rip heath
