i gave this film a one just to pull down the overall score of the film it doesnt deserve the 10th place on top 250 list there is no way that this film deserves ten points heath ledger was great in his role as a joker no doubt about that his early departure from the land of the living makes his role stand out in many peoples minds and give a extra glitter to whole movie without joker this film would have much less ten point votes story really was bloated with too many characters most of them just showing their face in the movie without any significance to the main storyline scarecrow and batman boys or what they were called were totally unnecessary bypassers in the first half of the movie story was all over the place and it didnt have the consistency or the red line that it could follow many scenes were just boring and ridiculous this film really didnt give nothing good to the whole batman saga
