oliver may not be dead  f**k series where the hero dies and to the half of the season  my wife and i will not watch the series if oliver queen not stay alive and return to the series through a maximum of two episodes so  giving time to change the scenario  liven it in any way except for memories of other characters in the series oliver and felicity have to be together and that we have not yet seen in the series atomic  ant  is superman and thats what he needs to become in the series  if he has already put some superpowers  now it turns out that all permanent characters in the series to become a super heroes which makes no sense just because the current craft shops in the series  giving the lowest rating oliver back
