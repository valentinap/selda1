this film is mostly just a video game without the controller there wasnt enough of the story to explain who the characters were it just jumps right in the scenes and dialogue happen very fast the villain was yet another classic villain who only does things because hes the bad guy and he likes dark places and wears spooky clothing because hes evil there is another villain who shows up in the movie who is presented as being badder than the main villain but then never shows up again this made no sense the characters rocket and groot added a little humor here and there as well as the other main characters but thats pretty much what all of the movie was there was no real sense of danger because at every twist and turn the heroes would solve it within five minutes or whatever even very very very big spaceships with giant laser beams approaching a planet felt like no danger because it always seemed that the heroes could handle it this is the problem with most action movies nowadays every thing in it is made to be epic and amazing movie viewers all around the world are constantly being shown movies with things that are specifically made to be epic and amazing that incredible cgi and other special effects begin to seem mediocre and they get used to it so much that nothing seems to amaze anyone anymore because every action movie is made in that way theres no more star wars kind of effects on audiences where they are thrilled by something new and creative this movie is mostly just a big show to dazzle spectators with special effects that you have to look very carefully to find any good storytelling in the film there has to be a balance between good story telling and good cgi in a film like this but instead this film is nothing but constant cgi explosions and cheesy oneliners that we begin to forget what the story is or why things are happening however the plot was extremely simple the villain had no sense of having a specific reason why he wanted to rule the galaxy all the characters are introduced too fast that we dont get used to them or relate to them the movie is like watching a video game
