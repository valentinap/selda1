just came from a sneak preview of this movie edward norton was nice enough to bring the movie to his alma mater yale university but unfortunately it doesnt live up to the preliminary hype or to the quality of his other work the problem here isnt acting he is still good in a demanding role that merited top billingrather than being put under pitt and the rest of the cast does admirably as well although brad pitt has played a role much like this beforesee 12 monkeys and helena bonham carters role is pretty much as demeaning to women as it gets jared leto and meat loaf yes meat loaf are also in this movie although you may not recognize leto with a badly scared face or meat loaf with breastsno i didnt stutter this film owes a lot to the game david finchers last movie in that it ends up with a complex plot that is solved a little too easily and nonlogically i wont destroy the film by explaining how exactly but the movie basically builds up to a climax that just doesnt resolve much and then resolves that with a further illogical ending the laughs along the way are not for the faint of heart or those who dont appreciate black comedy but they are the highlights of the film from the odd humor of norton and carter being addicted to help sessions for diseases they dont have to pitts interesting use of liposuction byproducts theres never too much appeal to the violence of the movie but the combination of nihilism and comedy doesnt send the movie into mediocrity its when the movie turns serious that it starts to turn sour as the plot twists out of control and a strange comedy turns into just another movie in the seventhe gamethe matrix genre of stylish mindless violence without much purpose point or original plot the script shows elements of literature that may have just been better in the original book but otherwise this is a movie with not much going for it except its cast answering questions edward norton joked about how working with brad pitt was easier for him because he could always rag on him about pitts bad movies whenever hed get on me id just have to say cool world and also said he thought he had yet to be part of a stinker this may just be his first and pitts latest
