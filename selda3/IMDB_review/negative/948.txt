 ive waited three years for a disappointing ending the scouring of the shire wasnt in the film and that was by far the most important scene in the story with saruman and wormtongue okay so maybe its in the second dvd comes out after the regular one gets bought up but this is just a marketing scheme the exploitation of a fine story this proves once and for all that literary adaptations are a true rip off of the authors intent fixed only on making large sums of money tolkien is no doubt rolling over in his grave people against this argument no doubt say that well yes but it brings the story to the masses why not encourage them to read instead i feel that the imagination of millions of kids is now ruined because they will never be able to read the books without having wood in their minds as frodo or astin as sam and the characters dont act that way in the book and how can we justify jacksons liberal treatment of the story to promote cgi graphics while disregarding the characters in the film basically the computer is now a character these books should have been left alone this isnt the best film of all time it is the best example of exploitation that has thus far been imagined
