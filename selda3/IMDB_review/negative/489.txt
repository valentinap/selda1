dont waste any of your precious time watching this terrible boring and dull film the acting was simply harrowing to watch anne hathaway was as always akin to balsa wood and completely implausible the woman just cant act the film rumbles along for an hour before anything happens by which time you dont really care and you are probably very bored the plot and i use the term loosely is ridiculous and there is more tension in a broken elastic band by watching this i feel like i traded brain cells for jellybeans i must comment on the special effects which i was led to believe were good they were not the script has more holes than a sieve especially when it comes to the scientific theories related to space travel please please dont watch this trash
