what a silly movie this is— creepy yuppie couple nick and amy live unhappily in the middle of american nowhere for petty reasons amy turns nasty on nick and plan the most incredible and farfetched disappearance act ever seen on screen in fact amy turns into a psychocrazy criminal mastermind committing several acts of violence on herself and others all graphically shown in the movie i guess this is the reason why the rating of gone girl is still so high it does not happen often to see a blond beautiful angelic young woman doing what amy does it is a sort of moralporn of female debasement the plot is wrapped up by one of the sloppiest police investigations ever and by amy and nick deciding to stay unhappily together for reasons impossible to understand just like the rest of the movie
