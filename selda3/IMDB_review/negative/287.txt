ive got to admit that guardians of the galaxy caught me by surprise its rare that a movie turns out to be even worse than i imagined it might be you try to sit through movies like this like battlefield earth or buckaroo banzai or total recall the schwarzenegger version i still havent bothered with the reimagined remake or the fifth element or any one of a thousand others and it becomes nothing more or less than self abuse my government knows no shame proclaims ronan in guardians of the galaxy nor apparently does his studio you know your movies in trouble when the one and only character worth watching for even a nanosecond is a cartoon raccoon named rocky rocket who incidentally has the best line in the movie all of them in a big hurry to get from something stupid to nothing at all pathetic thats called a nutshell review by the way this is just plain sloppy storytelling based on one of the leastinteresting comic books ever to see print and antman is next??? what are these people thinking? theres no rhyme or reason to anything theyre doing forget the lack of continuity this is simply hyping cgi sequences that might as well be cut and pasted on a disc unto themselves without the human element
