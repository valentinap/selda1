truthfully its not a 1 either but i feel compelled to balance out all the people who are giving it a 10 if i were able to give it an honest rating it would probably be a 5 out of 10 which is still pretty awful but well deserved this film is a pathetic sequel to a promising re invention of the batman franchise batman begins i have huge respect for christopher nolan mostly for memento which has an honest rating of 86 on imdb and justifiably ranks in the top 250 greatest films i make the distinction because i dont think the dark knight is being rated honestly the current rating of 94 is so obviously a sympathy vote for heath ledger who does a fantastic job that imdb should disqualify the rating as tainted i wont give anything away because theres truthfully not much to give away in the first place the story line is as schizophrenic and chaotic as the joker himself the internal logic of the film is all over the map and leads to a very unsatisfying conclusion if the result was an art film then a disjointed story might be forgivable but thats not the case this is a pedantic boring formulaic summer blockbuster film masquerading as a piece of art as i said heath ledgers joker is a great characterization even if it does draw noticeably on nicholsons portrayal ledger is undeniably fun to watch which is more than i can say for christian bale bale is a passable bruce wayne but in this film hes an extremely dull batman and whats with his voice was that his idea or nolans direction if youre going to utter dialogue sounding as if youve just gargled battery acid it can be effective only as a brief energetic exclamation preferably monosyllabic however if you try to speak for 5 minutes in this manner it becomes not only distracting but comical any time batman distressed his vocal cords for more than 10 seconds spontaneous laughter broke out all over the packed theater im sure this is not the response that nolan envisioned for these parts of the film to sum it all up seeing this film would be a complete waste of time if it wasnt for heath ledger wait for it to come out on video if you want to see a really good comic adaptation then go see ironman even fantastic 4 which was a big disappointment to me was a better comic adaptation than the dark knight
