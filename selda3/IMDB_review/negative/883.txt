ok dont know where to begin theres just too many things wrong with this dark knight 1st of all why does this movie have such high ratings because heath ledger died because if you actually watch the movie theres no reason for these high ratings the tim burton versions of batman in the 90s were a lot better than this hollywood plastic some random batman actions scenes a sloppy played joker that has nothing to offer than just to blow up police stations and hospitals wowhes such a clever joker he can blow up things i mean come on which part about this movie is good the atmosphere is not there  only 2 dimensions christopher nolan is doing his magic to make you sleepy because thats his magic gift to the world he can make me sleepy with movies like no other director but i guess im too old for this hype and only young people with really low iqs can enjoy this pile of rubbish i can only connect these 2 dots  1 low iq + 2 likes explosions = 90 rating on imdbwait and heath ledger died right yeah so imdb top ten movie right exactly
