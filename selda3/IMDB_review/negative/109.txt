this film sucked on every level imaginable from the script the acting the sound track the physics the cinematography the directing the editing the flow the lack of transition the script the acting the sound track the physics the cinematography    oops  my keyboard momentarily slipped into a transdimensional time altering state of flux that actually made more sense than anything about the film interstellar actually the film sucked with a force far greater than any gravitational pull exerted by a black hole that it literally pulled any intelligence out of the minds of the films viewers thereby destroying any rational or true cognitive ability to make a sound review of this really really really great film i want my mommy
