i do not understand the hype this movie was nothing but a waste of my time why first i believe a movie should have a clearly outlined plot so that you know whats going on this movie doesnt feature that it starts out of nowhere with no apparent background and has a pointless ending there are indeed a couple of scenes that might be fun to watch if you are in the right mind however most are violent and immature and the actors do an excellent performance but that doesnt pump this movie up to anything good it kind of shows you the happenings of a few drugdealers and criminals within a short timeframe thats all to sum it up this movie has few redeeming qualities do something productive and more fun instead such as washing the dishes two stars out of ten
