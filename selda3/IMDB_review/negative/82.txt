this movie has received unanimous acclaim from critics and is hugely popular with practically everyone else and i really cant understand why for me it fails to do the one thing a movie absolutely has to do  entertain it looks like a film studies exercise a technical achievement for sure but not a film made with the viewing public in mind for starters the near enough three hour run time is excessive to say the least boyhood is an unusual film that could end at any time during it and feel no less complete than the final cut this is what is baffling to me why couldnt they have started with mason a little older? or finished a little younger? it would still be as bland an ending as we ended up with there were opportunities within the film to elaborate on some of the plot points that arose for example the dinner scene with the lecturer as masons stepfather and its aftermath or in particular the all too brief part when he was confronted by a group of kids in the bathroom did we see how this affected mason as a person? did we see how he resolved the problem? no it was completely ignored and we continued at the horribly slow pace which still relentlessly ploughs on regardless of any potentially interesting events that may occur and finally perhaps the most irritating part of this film mason himself i cant understand why a film centred so heavily around a single protagonist would write a character to be so bland and unlikeable he spends the first half of the movie watching the mundane unexceptional world and people around him saying and doing nothing  i know hes just a young kid but he may as well not even be there the second half may be even worse as he goes from being a bland lifeless child to a completely unlikeable young adult he talks like he knows everything about life which at his age he clearly doesnt and makes a halfarsed attempt at becoming a photographer by going to college great nobody cares yet somehow they drag this out for as long as most other films last in total thankfully the movie ends rather abruptly at this point the movie may well be like real life but why is that entertaining? for a film centred on one characters life to work their story has to be interesting or unusual a film about an emotionless kid growing up to be an emotionless teen is as boring as it sounds linklater deserves the directing oscar for sticking by a project for 12 years and having such an original idea but the final product has wasted three hours of my life and if you havent seen it yet i really wouldnt waste your time
