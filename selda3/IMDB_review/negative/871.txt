 this movie is good but not the best movie ever made not even close to being the best movie ever made why has imdb allowed anyone and everyone to vote this is insane prestige by the same director and cast is far far farrrr better the background score is a killer thats what sets the mood of the entire film the movie should actually be called the dark clown because the joker is just one of the best characters played on screen in a long long time heath ledger has the soul of the character in his grasp as for batman where is he i hardly saw him
