i went to see this godawful turkey because the reviews were good and i thought maybe there was something there worth seeing but alas my instincts were correct it was made to be delivered to the faithful who prefer their characters flattened out and wrapped in plastic against a blue screen delivering the usual predictable crappy comic book dialogue there goes another five or six hours ill never get back one of the worst aspects of this movie experience was the ever present omnipresent ubiquitous portentous ominous and and and redundant symphonic music every single second of screen time is infused with impending dread christian bale stares longingly into maggie gyllenhalls eyes tremulous haunting minor chords christian bale glances away at the darkened spires of gotham slow crescendo on b flat etcetera i guess this film was just marketed too effectively i was convinced and went the first batman film starred michael keaton as wayne which was an inspired casting choice much like casting robert downey jr as iron man it would be impossible i think for either downey or keaton to yield up a flat performance in this case though christian bales performance primarily grim determination has been flattened out to match the furniture leaving only heath ledger and of course michael caine still standing as convincing characters is that enough to make the film worth watching its up to you but a i knew it was the last i would see of ledger andb the script for michael caine just isnt that good on balance i cant recommend it
