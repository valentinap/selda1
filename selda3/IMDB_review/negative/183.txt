spoiler alert i cant believe that there are so many glowing reviews of this movie on the plus side brilliant cg fx cinematography on the negative side the awful acting the terrible plot the script the hokey comic book physics explained for the lowest common denominator in the audience i really liked mcconaughey in dallas buyers club  by far the best thing hes done to date but in this movie? just another flybythe seatofthepants astronaut risking everything and everyone but it all works out in the end of course way too much time at the start of the movie setting up the ending which came as no surprise whatsoever thanks to the ghost and then we discover that love conquers all including science of course probably most of the reason i rated this so low is because with a name like interstellar i was expecting way too much depth on the intricacies of theoretical interstellar travel the time relativity concept et al sigh and the smartass wisecracking robot was the last straw just so bad
