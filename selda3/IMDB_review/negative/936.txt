 for a film to be 10 10 it really has to be almost perfect i know its all about opinions but to get that rating it must be technically well made you know entertaining good plot special fx acting realism etc oh and when i say realism i dont mean you cannot have superheroes or fantasy but within the framework of the movie you have to follow its own rules for example the matrix was still realistic even though people could fly it was set in a computer so its possible i liked the fact tdk was serious and dark but that is where the positives end the plot is ludicrous as the joker who is a human being is omnipresent clairvoyant a great hypnotist invincible and has no human needs i know this is a comic book movie but when you set up a film in a normal america city with normal physics and all that goes with it you cannot then just make up a completely implausible story of events the joker is beaten up involved in car crashes doesnt seem to sleep yet is perfectly fine at all times has a vast amount of mindless kamikaze henchmen who inexplicably do everything he says the joker is able to accurately predict where everyone in gotham will be at any time and able to somehow be in 20 places at once no one notices the huge amounts of explosives placed in the hospital or the boats or any building in town for that matter a man with a bomb and phone inside him is conveniently in the right place at the right time somehow avoiding the police metal detectors or dying from his surgery in the end the story is too unbelievable and too long as well you dont care about anyone as everything is too unrealistic therefore this film cannot ever be considered a 10 10 almost regardless of opinion i quite liked the filming and the mood of the film but it has too many flaws to be considered that good i gave it a 1 10 which is too harsh but i felt obligated to bring down the overall rating
