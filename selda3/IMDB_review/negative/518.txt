at first i thought this movie is a parody of all the other superhero nerdy clich_s and i kept waiting for something funny to happen at some point i started to realize that this movie is for real for real boy meets girl and after trying to kill each other they fall in love the bad guys must work together in order to save the world therefore becoming the good guys they of course defeat the evil all their criminal past is erased they get the universes recognition yada yada yada everyone lives happily ever after this movie couldnt even make me smile terrible acting no emotion no sparkle no nothing if i could i would rate this movie zero stars
