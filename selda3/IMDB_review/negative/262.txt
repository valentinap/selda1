looking the reviews i thought it was worth a watch the 1st hour was not too bad  highlights of the usual family problems in american culture etc  but the other 2 hrs was really disappointing while the timeline of actors and culture serves to make this movie somewhat unique there wasnt much of a plot other than this is what its like in real life in which case it would be a documentary but it was not there was a good introduction in the 1st houri was still waiting to anticipate how the plot would go but not much buildup no climax and no resolution pretty disappointing to what i thought might be a good story
