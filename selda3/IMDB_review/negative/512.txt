being a fan of disneys 1959 sleeping beauty i was excited for maleficent one of disneys most iconic villains to be brought to life in live action however after seeing the film i am utterly disappointedin the film maleficent the classic story of sleeping beauty is butchered the film by itself is not a bad film the visuals are great and angelina jolie actually resembles maleficent this film though ignores the already established tale of sleeping beauty and makes up a new one while watching this film i was pleased with the initial backstory created for maleficenthowever this backstory pins stefan as the actual villain and maleficent as the a victimin this backstory stefan removes maleficents wings in order to be the next king this change was one i was at first willing to tolerate however maleficent interacts with aurora from the time that she is a newborn all the way up to her teens maleficent becomes so close with aurora that aurora begins to call her a fairy godmother this destroys maleficents character maleficent is supposed to be cruel and evil but this film makes her out to be a loving motherly figure things only get worse from there prince phillip is a practically useless character in this film he appears to be a naive and unintelligent teenager instead of the powerful prince he is supposed to be then adding to the uselessness of phillips character when aurora is in her deathlike sleep phillips kiss does not wake her up it is maleficents kiss that wakes her up i find this change to be completely unacceptable maleificent is supposed to hate aurora and phillip is supposed to fight epically to save aurora then once aurora is awake again she teams up with maleficent to escape from stefans castle in doing so aurora finds maleficents wings which are still flapping she gives them to maleficent who basically becomes indestructible this sequence is so departed from the sleeping beauty story that it seems like it contains all new characters instead of the already established maleficent an aurora my biggest complaint is about the dragon maleficent does not turn into a dragon there is a dragon but it is not maleficent and it is easily overpowered by stefans soldiers phillip is not involved with he dragon at all the dragon in the 1959 sleeping beauty is one of the most iconic scenes in all of disney history and the fact that they removed that scene is appalling to me maleficent completely ignores the context set by sleeping beauty and twists it into a lesser version
