just the fact that most men that drool over this film tend to react angrily when i convey my negative opinions of fight club proves that this film not only fails to deliver any new and important ideas but also that it encourages the mainstream male marketing plan be angry be violent be masculine be straight be selfish and most of all be stupid the film employs a juvenile sense of humor comedy approach thats immature and sickening the ending is a total idiotic rip off that makes the watching of this garbage a waste of time the deep message here is that young white males victimized by society can fight commercialism by beating the st out of each other wow man thats really deep cue you just dont get the movie man yeah i just dont get the movie what a joke the whole premise behind fight club is tiresome and trite oh the poor straight healthy young male and how hes been victimized fight club is a movie produced by the sickening hollywood greed machine
