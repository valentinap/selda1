this first mi movie was bad enough as it was now that we are on mi 12 or something like that it just makes it worse most puzzling is that many of the actors in this movie have done great movies thus i have to wonder were they improving in this piece of crap? was de palma just like meh f*ck it let the special effects guys write this garbage dont get me wrong tom cruise is an awful actor anyway but christ it was a socalled all star lineup if it wasnt touted to this day as a good movie i wouldnt comment but this sh*t will not end kill it already in my opinion if you havent seen this movie consider yourself lucky
