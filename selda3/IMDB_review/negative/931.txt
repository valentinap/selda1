 the dark knight is the worst sequel since highlander 2 the quickening i am dumbfounded at this entry into the franchise that was re invigorated so wonderfully with batman begins i speak to people frequently about this film and have had little opposition to my views on it ergo people dont like it i really think this film is the biggest dupe since the blair witch project i want to make it clear that i love batman bob kanes batman frank millers batman jeph loebs batman and the dc animated universes batman like many i found the tim burton and joel schumacher films excruciating to watch batman begins came along and christopher nolan gave us a batman we could respect and understand as well as believe we were then teased with the jokers calling card and ready for what was going to be the meeting of the the most famous adversaries in comic and screen historyand we gota joker with self applied makeup and no gadgets who is essentially a terrorist no batcave a batsuit that looked like a riot cop a convoluted scorsese like story about laundered money and a massive emphasis on factionalised and organised crime a two face whos only motive is a dead girlfriend a batman we hardly see and a gotham city that now looks like chicago but the enigma i cant stomach is that the film had no climax i asked many viewers what they thought the climax was and there is a different answer each timeoh it was batman confronting dentno it was the joker hanging upside down no it was rachel dawes being killedno there was no climax this films success lies only in the sad fact that its main antagonist was played by an actor who died during the promotional phase of the film in nolans attempt to legitimise the batman mythos he has made it sterile and boring
