ok ill keep this brief but ill also nail my credentials to the mast first i know science cosmology scifi and filmmaking pretty well i have in the past taught film studies at degree level and worked on the production of more than one major hollywood scifi film i read stephen baxter and i like space stuff a lot more than a lot and why am i telling you this? because i should have loved interstellar but i didnt for one simple reason it is a truly dreadful piece of filmmaking i wont even bother with dissecting the science in the film because that isnt really the issue it is wrong on pretty much every level im not even going to bother complaining about the absurd audio balance in the sound mix and ill ignore the substandard special effects  because fx dont a great movie make the issues i have with interstellar are essentially these the film is an arsenumbing three hours long and feels far longer the pace is stunningly poorly judged  the first hour in particular could have been cut to ten minutes and far more would have been gained than lost the characters are paperthin and i didnt care about any of them the plot is entirely derivative mostly of the vastly superior contact the special effects arent special at all and the editing or lack of is so selfindulgent it is a text book example of a director so enamoured with his project that he loses objectivity the result is a plodding flabby and desperately dull movie devoid of any real excitement or emotional impact i wont go on but special mention must be made of the planets  paddling world and coldworld you see virtually nothing of either and so utterly uninteresting are they that what should have been a moment of genuine cinematic wonderment was squandered with a bit of poor cgi painfully inferior to a perfect storm and a location less dramatic than your own back garden ive probably not been a brief as i intended but as i write this i feel the disappointment and actual anger i felt on leaving the cinema bubbling to the surface again it was a total letdown and a waste of more than three hours of my life the gushing reviews on here are ridiculous and absurd and i am forced to conclude that reviewers either watched a different film to me or saw something so brilliant it completely passed me by i am fairly confident i didnt doze off although i desperately wanted to so in conclusion contact did all of this far far better fifteen years ago in contact the characters are human believable beautifully realised and you care what happens to them the relationship between father and daughter is deeply moving and inspiring but then the plot is far more sophisticated anyway dealing with the social tensions and impact of the discovery of extraterrestrial life the science is accurate and entirely plausible it was written by carl sagan after all the movie is genuinely thrilling and full of spectacle and it has something very profound to say contact is everything interstellar is not and it has a considerably shorter running time contact brought tears to my eyes interstellar bored me to tears
