this film is an antiintellectual zenith it is offensive at least for someone who has a rudimentary knowledge of astrophysics and the theory of relativity i have never seen such sf movie full of nonsense at least in the last 20 years every single law of physics is broken or adjusted to hollywood pulp ethical problems concerning time travel were already discussed 60 years ago medeagaia hypothesis is an old fairy tale pseudo philosophical use of feelings with respect to the multidimensional timespace is simply ridiculous situations that occur in the vicinity of the event horizon i can only say serious case of ignorance and standard use moral treatise about human nature based on common sense is too obvious someone who makes movies based on comic books shouldnt be allowed to make a sf movie really bad choice i am disappointed very disappointed 1 point is for the robots best regards
