there are so many to list but they are so obvious and stupid that the suspension of disbelief is totally gone nano bots so small they are in the air and rain yet to be infected these people must be touched? ridiculous everyone in the entire area would be breathing them nano bots repair tissue heal skin restore eyesight? okay that is futuristic and believable main facility loses power and they are no longer getting healed okay i suppose the nanobots need some form of power but the previously healed revert back the blind man goes blind again? ridiculous he was already healed why do the fallen wounded float up to standing like some silly paranormal phenomenon? stupid effects that are so out of place and ruin the moment over and over again this movie was a complete poosandwich and the fact they gross over $100m is tantamount to theft
