i have actually watched just about all of the show that has been released i am not writing my review after watching ten minutes of the pilot and deciding its crap i really kind of liked the idea behind this show i heard some people complaining about the lack of realism but come on its a superhero show a little unrealism ought to be allowed upon watching the first few episodes i kinda hoped that like lots of great television shows the actors and writers just needed a bit of time to get into their groove really find their characters once that occurred i reasoned the quality of the show would start to pick up so despite my initial reservations i kept watching and waiting and waiting and waiting it just never happened the plot has remained unimaginative static and predictable the actors are wooden and unsympathetic and the writing is overall just a train wreck i could honestly predict exactly what the actors were going to say next it pains me to see this truly mediocreatbest show get the rating it has received i will attribute this injustice to the fact that the actors are incredibly pretty and the assumption that those giving this show a good rating would have their brains explode upon watching some quality programming
