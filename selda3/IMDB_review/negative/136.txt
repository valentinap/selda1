the problem with kingsman the secret service is that it cant decide whether its a spy movie or a movie about violent killers or a comedy it tries to do some of all three it partially succeeds as a spy movie owing a lot to old james bond films and did anyone catch the reference to get smart? and granted there are a few funny moments but the violence overwhelms everything else theres plenty of gratuitous killing and its not the least bit subtle if thats your cup of tea prepare to have a great time for me i think the story would be have been better if 90% of the fight scenes had been left on the cutting room floor plotwise its completely predictable a few minutes into the movie we can already guess which two characters would end up in a fight to the finish at the end very mild spoiler alert the movie ends with the audience essentially being mooned thanks a lot guys id gladly return the favor if i knew you were watching one last point some user reviews have complained that the fword is used quite a bit it is but really is that the most offensive thing here? the entire premise of the dastardly project and the implication that almost every world leader mindlessly buys into it is far worse not to mention the almost nonstop display of blood and guts some of the killings are presented in an almost comical way and neednt be taken seriously but most of it is just grossly and needlessly excessive
