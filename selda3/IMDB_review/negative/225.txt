okay this movie is a comedy right? okay i know that its says here on imdb that it is a drama mystery sci fi but it must be a comedy because the movie is totally laughable the script is totally laughable or worse its a kind of the lawnmower man from 1992 remakewhich was also laughable but you can forgive the lawnmower man for being a bad movie but this one you cant this movie is just like if someone gave a scientist 20 millions dollars so he could invent a technology that could turn cheese back too milk again a total waste of money i sincerely hope that mr depp and mr freeman has donated most off their money that they earned from this to doctors without borders or a children cancer foundation i once saw an interview with mr deep saying that he never goes to any premiere now i know why
