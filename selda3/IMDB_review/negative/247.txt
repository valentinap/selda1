my goodness where do we start? first of all the many 10s this got must have come from the cast and crew or a bunch of people with the scientific knowledge of a 3yrold nolan must know nothing about real science he bandies wormholes and anomolies around like he really knows what they are had there not been so many high paid actors in this it probably would have never been filmed at all just shows that putting big hollywood stars in a movie doesnt guarantee a good product in the end i wont go into all the flaws and idiotic ideas mentioned but just imagine a movie with less scientific expertise than the old 60s show lost in space will robinson and his robot were more believable than anything shown in this laughable attempt at a science fiction movie the biggest irony is that the whole point of the movie was to save humanity as soon as possible by finding a new planet to live on yet they didnt even get back the first time for 23 years and when they return nothing has changed on earth at all his kids are grown but they still live in the same run down house and michael caine who was about 80 when they left seems not to have aged at all when they get back and the crops that were supposed to be dying off causing the death of humanity all look exactly the same still acres and acres of corn fields waiting to be harvested every time they tried to say something intelligent the audience laughed no one in the theater took this movie seriously at all sad because they might have done so much with this idea had they incorporated people who understood space travel and general science bottom line this was a low budget script with a load of expensive actors what a waste
