i saw the rating of 83 at the imdb and wanted to watch the movie the movie started well but then it moved into the same lame side of the universethe movie brings nothing new to us it was like watching avengers againor any other superhero movie where the superheroes fight with each other at the beginning but then unite to fight a common enemy the movie was packed with inappropriate and lame humour the acting was below average marvels should really consider the type of movies that they r making i am still shocked that how on earth that this movie got an 83 ratings this surely effects the credibility of imdb
