as a fan of marvel movies i was excited to see guardians of the galaxy however this movie failed on several levels it is supposed to a comedy but the jokes are not funny i genuinely laughed once furthermore one joke was weirdly inappropriate the story is completely generic it seems like they just needed some story any story as a vehicle for the characters to get together and try to be funny i wanted to write a review without spoilers but the big setpiece ending of a spaceship crashing into the ground has to be called out this was done in the avengers and star trek into darkness to me its like directors have to have this 911 shot in every movie big thing crashes into buildings and it has to stop its boring now the only positive about this movie was the special effects and space backgrounds it seems that marvel have figured out punters will pay cash money for any old junk if its wrapped up in special effects and a decent soundtrack i will approach the next marvel with extreme caution and i will not see guardians of the galaxy 2
