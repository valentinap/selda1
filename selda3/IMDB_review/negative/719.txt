 i really enjoyed this movie well about 45 minutes of it unless you are a die hard fanatic for the lotr books and maybe even then youll want to watch this with one finger on the fast forward button some scenes were excellent but not enough when diluted by so much filler the special effects may have been masterful but they didnt make it a great movie the movie simply takes itself far too seriously how else could the director possibly justify being almost 35 hours long similarly to voters here this is rated as #3 in the top 250 of all time that is so astoundingly overrated that i cannot understand it this with 65000+ votes it probably belongs in the top 1000 perhaps about #800 [how has the studio managed to create 45k+ imdb accounts to skew the voting] the basic flaw of the entire trilogy is that its based on a long winded violently racists set of books starting from that you end up with well you know truthfully this is a 7 10 but it could have been a 75 if theyd actually done some editing down to ~15 hours
