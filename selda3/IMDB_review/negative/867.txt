what can i say i gave this thing a 1 because i honestly have never felt it was all that good i that saw the average was a 9 at the time i voted and i felt the dissenters should get some representation brando isnt all that great in it i mean the thing is better than the average film at least im supposed to believe that but 9 out of 10 no way watch different movies in fact watch other coppala movies i personally like the outsiders and the conversation better i find the story to be boring i also think the structure of the script is a little too gimicky and amateurish i wont go into detail on this i will just say the thing left me dry
