this is the biggest disappointment ive had at the theater in a long time even worse than noah the idea was outstanding with the flavor of 007 james bond from live and let die days with the cool gadgets and the cheeky humor everyone i know wanted to see this movie then they put in more cussing than scarface and more blood than kill bill and drowned it in a hard r that left the audience stunned and confused if this movie had been a pg13 for the family it would have been the beginning of a chain of profitable and enjoyable movies for these folks instead they made fun of rednecks and republicans used the fword as a conjunction in every sentence in the movie had scenes that were so brutal and outofplace in this funny little movie that i looked at my wife and mother and they were covering their eyes they drowned this guaranteed winner in obscenity and blood if you are an 18 year old marine or just out of jail enjoy if you are a parent or on a date or any other member of the target audience for movies skip this sleazy piece of poop
