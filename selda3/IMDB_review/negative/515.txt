avoid this couple at all costs  they are very toxic gone girl is a misleading title since amy is not a girl she used to be a childhood storybook celebrity named amy but there is nothing girlish like about her in this movie in fact she calls herself the cword david fincher has made some of my favorite movies fight club zodiac etc but this is not one of my favorites this movie is all the things i dislike in a movie  tedious depressing unlikeable characters dark photography moody music strange casting smug dialogue this might work with the girl with the dragon tattoo but come to think of it  that was no girl either
