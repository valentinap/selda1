 this would go down as one of the worst movie of the year an overhyped tale i havent read the book but after seeing the movie i will steer clear of anything to do with the lord of the rings the convinently call able ghost army made it the most anti climatic ending after the 6 8 hrs spent building the tension over the 3 movies it is the same as the anti climatic fight at helms deep when gandalf appears to save the day what was the purpose of the elves there were so many holes in the plot the emphasis that sam wise was not gay was sickening meant wasting 5 mins in the end showing he marries a woman and has 3 kids to make it more suitable to the times frodo and sam wise should have just come out of the closet it is a shame that people have voted it to become in the top 3 movies at imdb
