yes these days its hard to single out a movie as exceedingly dumb when people rave about crap like pulp fiction and the matrix but this must take a special prize at least in this case this qualifies as a so bad its good exercise whereas the others were just mindless bores of course its largely thanks to the incredibly bad acting of ed norton and brad pitt who should form a triumvirate with keanu reeves as the most overpaid talentless bunch of numbnuts ever to grace the screen with their lack of talent in fact the only good performance here is by meatloaf which is saying a lot if you think the plot is original its not the same idea was presented in a half hour episode of alfred hitchcock presents over 30 years ago that was directed by the master himself still even if it was faked i did greatly enjoy seeing pitt and norton beating each other to a bloody pulp they both certainly deserve it for their past and future work
