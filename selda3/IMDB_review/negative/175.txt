that summary does not mean i find work aimed towards teenagers awful as a rule i dont generalise it simply means its another addition to the genre of teenage fiction which is so poor it deserves to be labelled as tripe in and of itself the divergent series is based on books of the same name which means right from the off many of us who havent read said books knew there would be a devoted fanbase to the series i dont begrudge those fans their opinions and i cant speak for how this movie works as an adaptation what i can do is summarise its effectiveness appeal and overall enjoyability as a standalone piece of cinematography and on the whole i am thoroughly amused in a pitying way the characters have zero appeal because weve seen them all before the deer in the headlights type of teenage lead the heartless and shallow arch enemy and an ensemble of clichs including but not limited to the male warrior and sex appeal the small group of enlightened protagonists the gormless population living under heel etcetera etcetera i had an issue with the distinct lack of originality in the first movie with it bearing notable similarities to huxleys brave new world and orwells 1984 not to mention the more recent hunger games and other pieces of dystopian fiction the point is the movie stands on the work of other successful franchises  whether novels or movies  and allows those series to lay the groundwork for what it portrays as a riproaring fight against tyranny but which is in reality another slugfest of brainless acting numbing action and unoriginal plot points im not going to say anything overly negative against shailene woodley as ive yet to see her in anything but this series but im unimpressed with her acting potential thus far she isnt helped by the poor script and mediocre directing so i wont be too critical but by this stage im not holding my hopes up for an upandcomer in anything beyond typecast roles in future productions the acting of the support cast is what you might expect  an attempt to appeal to the youthful masses and bearing no distinctly original traits of their own in any sense whatsoever the worst part has to be the story the simple motive is if youve seen it in dystopian features youll probably see it in the divergent series the basic structure is flimsy with regards to the castes huxley fans will see what i did there that people are forced to choose and the idea of a rebellion against the oligarchy portrayed is so clichd that it just doesnt hold any interest in fact you might be able to accurately predict the majority of events which transpire in this film and as any moviegoer will tell you that is never a good thing we need originality and we arent given it by any stretch of the imagination action flicks for teenagers need a new format if theyre going to survive i feel and this does nothing to refresh the genre on the contrary its rather like dragging a dead horse into the town square and then repeatedly whipping it for laughs although the only laughs are mine and theyre painful if youre a fan of the novels or someone seeking pointless cinematic thrills you might enjoy this but if you have a refined taste in films or are expecting to see something worth the popcorn i advise you to flee not walk away but literally flee with cheetahlike pace and dont look back
