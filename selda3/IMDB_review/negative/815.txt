 wellwhere do i begin i have no idea heath ledger given an award after he died the man was a drug addict and simply went too far not such a great performance in the film actually mediocre but because he went tits up his role was portrayed as one of the greatest ever nonsense like i said mediocre as far as batman is concerned he definitely needs some throat lozenges what a crock with that voice they had him use it was less than halfway through when i lost all interest and forgot what the plot was if there was one the only reason i saw the ending credits was simply because of the fact that i needed some background noise for the evening you want some real batman watch the 60s tv show campyyes phonyyes utterly ridiculousyes but it was batman and enjoyable in one sentence the worst ever
