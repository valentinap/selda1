guardians of the galaxy is a new low for marvel and for the comic book sub genre in general no one was clamoring for a movie to be made from the comic book that almost no one had even heard of however because of the marvel brand and the stunning visuals and action sequences this became one of the highest grossing films of the year the film is no more than a cash grab and a stepping stone in setting up the second avengers the characters are trite and obvious and the villain i cant remember his name for the life of me could not have been more inconsequential or underdeveloped groot was the only part of the movie besides the visuals that was mildly interesting the story is ridiculous as well as the setting this movie has a higher rating on imdb than some of the best films of the year including foxcatcher the grand budapest hotel and the theory of everything
