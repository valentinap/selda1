hard to sit through and terribly misleading its a shame that such content can be shown in our theaters commemorating death advocating women as sex symbols or damsels in distress and portraying mass murder as a cool action scene the first third of the movie has great action scenes that one would expect from a spy film easy to compare to the bond films however as the movie progressed the entire validity of the characters morals were flushed down the drain i and my two other adult friends had to cover our eyes and grimace at many scenes and we left all agreeing that we did not sign up for that sort of film the trailer did an awesome job at capturing my excitement then the movie did an equally great job of shattering that excitement i stress please watch at your own discretion
