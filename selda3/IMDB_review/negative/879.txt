i really dont know what is on in this version of batman which made the record for all time box office it was the worst the batman voice is very gay trying hard to be male in every superhero movies leading lady always be on perfect look but not on dark knight there is only one truth it was totally dark the story was adapted from spider man 3 lack of batman gadgets cast was boring i cant see any good looking cast on every fight scenes batman really obvious that it was handled by a real martial art expert and not the actor itself
