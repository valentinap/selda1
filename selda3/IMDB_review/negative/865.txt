i have to agree with those reviewers that find this film disjointed overly and unnecessarily violent and just plain difficult to understand i for one fail to see how this movie resurrected the career of john travolta as his performance was just totally unbelievable focusing on what appears to be several unrelated life experiences tarrantino once again utilizes his penchant for violence drug addiction rape and other assorted seedy topics the plot if you want to call it that is non existent and the scene involving ving rhaimes is just flat out disgusting for tarrantino fans this may be the ultimate but for me its just not a good film
