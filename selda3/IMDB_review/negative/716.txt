bad bad bad it is such a shame that this movie is so bad it really has the potential to be great but no no no the first two movies were okay but this last one really sucked and yet everybody are joining this mass hysteria over this really really bad movie i just cant understand why a movie with really bad special effects and really bad acting bad directing but a great story can be the winner of 11 oscars the world has truly gone mad and to add it as the second best movie based on votes from users its sad just sad there are tons of movies that are better and this really is the movie that would never end very long ending 30 minutes of fading and ending only to not really end bearf i think people are mistaking the movie for the book sad
