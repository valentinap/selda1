just as with other of nolans flicks this is as pretentious and filled with nonsense how can anyone believe that travelling through a black hole will be as simple as walking though a park? even the visuals weret that great just look at some hubble pics for petes sake the story line was weak unbelievable this movie made a mockery out of everything scientific it is scifi at its worst did anyone notice how this movie was a hack of twister? tars collected the data? like how the mini transmitter things were let go in a twister to transmit data? i find it really disturbing so many people think this movie is close to perfect i was shifting in my seat anxiously waiting for the end this piece of bs is not worth the time and money close to 3 hours of my lifei will never get that back thanks
