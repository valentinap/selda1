the reason im writing this review is because i was told it an amazing movie etc etc however i would advise you all to not waste your time mathew mcconeghey is an excellent actor no doubt but in this movie i find him mumbling and its hard to understand what hes saying the storyline is completely unbelievable it does not make sense in the least its a really big stretch of the imagination and lets not forget matt damons role im still trying to figure out why he would play such an insignificant and antagonistic role opposite mathew mcconeghey as far as the graphics go i watched it in imax and though the special effects are cool in imax its not worth the 2 hrs of your time basicallyyoull walk out of there googling almost every phrase you heard dont say no one warned you
