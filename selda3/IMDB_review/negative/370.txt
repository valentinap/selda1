i truly believe that all these giant user reviews with 10 stars are just paid to review it this movie is a massive disappointment seeing it again will not change anything its just down right boring it is over hyped to no end do not waste your time and money seeing this in the theater this movie has a rating up near the shawshank redemption it does not even come close to being that good of a movie when the shawshank redemption is on tv you dont turn it off no one does because that is an example of a great movie if i never hear about this movie again that is all that will salvage it in my mind some of the visuals were nice but that is about it they werent great it was few and far between and honestly i dont know how you can even try to bank on the visuals because it was basically like any other space movie there was nothing that set it apart in my mind i couldnt even consider being impressed by any aspect of this movie it should be put on a shelf and forgotten christopher nolan should go back to making batman movies
