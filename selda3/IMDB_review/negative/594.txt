i know everyone is saying that this movie is great it has so much to say about society the script is so good blah blah blah for the first time in my life however i was motivated actually to get up and to leave the theatre in the middle of the film yes the movie has a message beyond fighting is good but it is just so inyourface that i couldnt take any more after the first hour it did not help that i didnt care what happened to any of the characters even though i dont have a problem with brad edward or helena generally anyone who saw this movie and came away wondering exactly what the director was trying to say must have been asleep i dont think that a film has to be completely offensive to make a point of course this is only my opinion i know there is supposedly a plot twist at the end and whatever it was it just could not have been worth another hour and a half of this film to get to it by the way i have seen other offensive movies and enjoyed them natural born killers being one of them so i am not just being a weenie about the whole thing i liked se7en and i completely loved the game but this one just is not up to their standards see one of these movies instead if you have never seen a fincher film before
