i cannot believe how disappointed i was watching this film form all of the reviews i thought i was about to see a modern classic in instead i watched a movie so lacking in common sense that the last hour was almost unwatchable the plot is very obvious even the ending without giving away any plot lines it seems that in this film common sense and the trail of evidence does not exist once the real story is revealed as the last hour of the movie dragged on and on i was hoping for some redeeming scene that would make everything right or at least make sense unfortunately this did not happen maybe one of the worst good movies ive ever scene if this is what people think is good plot twists then the iq of movie watchers has gone down into the single digits
