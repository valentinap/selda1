let me start by saying that maleficent has been a personal favorite of mine when it comes to disney villains throughout her many interpretations she has simply been evil yes with a capital e so forgive me if this review is a bit of a rant in this adaptation she is reinterpreted as a good fairy because shes apparently not a human sorceress anymore? that simply has a hissyfit she is certainly not evil  just angry for a little while she even ends up becoming a godmother?? even king stephens character is butchered why does he go insane over her? if he were really the bad guy why wouldnt he have killed maleficent when he had the chance? what possible reason does he have for being indifferent about the welfare of his daughter? speaking of aurora its worth mentioning that she is relatively alright but still not too close to her original character a petty aesthetic thing about her is that her hair and eyebrows are not the same color which is really distracting additionally they rehash the concept from frozen which is that true love doesnt have to be from some man if this trend continues from disney all well see is sisterlygodmotherlyfamily love movies where romance is thrown out the window because it apparently doesnt end with a happily ever after anymore overall this film was simply horrible if you respected maleficent as a villain if you did like maleficent as she was i dont recommend seeing this movie even if you like the idea of there being no such thing as evil i urge you not to see this movie dont support the people who made it
