the idea of the film is great they are exploring a side of cinema never before explored however i feel that taking on this task should have demanded more creativity and flare from the numb nuts who put this collage of rubbish together forgive me if ive missed anything but i feel that i spent the best part of 3 hours watching a rude illmannered brat grow up with a disappointingly boring life i spent the entire film looking for the beauty or the message in this masterpiece and left with a distinct feeling that the people who produced this hideous montage got carried away with how good they thought the idea was and refused to admit that they messed up nothing bloody happened my definition of a good film is one which makes you feel something which gives you a sense of excitement or admiration something which makes you think about an interesting topic i was present for my growing up and it was infinitely more interesting and personal than this fake hollywood crap also it would have been nice for it to have had an ending or some sort of redeeming quality like an announcement that we had actually been sitting through a practical joke and this film wasnt genuinely being considered great imdb rating 90? maybe thats a joke too and this is all one big joke and everyone in hollywood is laughing at us unfortunately the minimum rating is 110 whereas i believe negative possibilities would have been appropriate in ancient rome they had no concept of negative numbers i feel that seeing this film would have progressed their discovery of this side of 0 dont see this film please and for goodness sake dont let it win any oscars i dont want the industry to be polluted with films like this
