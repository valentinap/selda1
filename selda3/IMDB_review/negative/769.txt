first i am a huge fan of the lotr series by tolkien it is one of the most richly detailed and wonderfully written stories of all time and it pains me to see the dreck that peter jackson has produced i didnt mind the fellowship of the ring i thought it was definitely the most concise and well directed of the three films also the visual aesthetics of the films are excellent the set design and choice of locale is impeccable and i applaud the people involved for their dedication to recreating the surreal wonderful world of tolkien on screen however it is the technical aspect of the project what should be the real beef of the film that puts the knife in the two towers marked the real beginning of jacksons self righteous altering of tolkiens noble story and left many fans and serious film goers wondering what went wrong but return of the king takes the cake for what could very possibly be the worst adaptation of a novel in film history jackson changes large portions of the plot of the novel for no apparent purpose even friends of mine who had not read the book asked me why certain scenes resolved the way they did the character development is excruciating as some of the major character based events from the book seem rushed and inconsequential in the context of the film jackson has done a great job at remembering the characters names and their titles but has drawn a blank on their behavior values emotions and relationships with other characters the script is pathetic tolkiens majestic storytelling and tasteful use of pathos and emotional turmoil is replaced by long winded sappy clich‹© monologues complete with the exact same musical score used for the previous two films entire scenes are based around petty arguments and melodramatic emotional breakdowns and filler dialog is rampant it seems that jackson did this simply to keep the 3 hour running time the action sequences are grandiose and somewhat true in objective form to tolkiens telling of them but jackson employs cinematography that is on par with a nickelodeon miniseries using cheap close ups and nauseatingly swirling camera angles that leave the viewer feeling more confused than involved in the action jackson throws in some cheap action film comic relief during the battles giving the viewer the impression that the characters are not fighting for their lives but rather swashbuckling for swashbucklings sake very simply this is not the lord of the rings that i grew to love years ago when i read tolkiens masterpiece i am a supporter of artistic freedom in the adaptation process ie kubrick coppola but not when the adapter simply has no artistic ability in his craft jackson genius behind such film classics as the frighteners and dead alive this film does not belong in the top 250 nor do the other lotr films knowing that this film is above seven samurai and casablanca and that the first two lotr films are the reason citizen kane sits at #11 sickens me
