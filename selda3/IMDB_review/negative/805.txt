 dont believe the hype not good at all focuses too much on the jokerbatman is supposed to be a hero the old batman movie with nicholson is a much more satisfying movie watch this only if you are 12 15 years old and what is with the darkness batman isnt supposed to be like this it is like they took the worst of the 90s comics and made this movie out of it and i bet that there are a lot of you saying but it made all that money so what that doesnt mean it is a great movie wait a few years the micheal keaton batman will still be around this movie wont the acting is mediocre the action is ok but it focuses too much on the evil side watch iron man or something if you want a super hero movie from this year i give it a 1 10
