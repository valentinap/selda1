this really is a very poor plot indeed  but it would be unfair to list the many logical flaws here and so spill the story but you can look up other websites for the synopsis if you want to discover what i mean in summary though not only does the plot defy all reasonable logic and expectations of a true police investigation but its as if the author gets so far and doesnt know how to end the story and after dragging it one for nearly 2 12 hours panics and ends it all abruptly very unsatisfactorily the characterisation suddenly implodes at the end and the main character played by ben affleck who has been stable and consistent the rest of the movie within the last 5 minutes suddenly changes 360 degrees to become a completely different character which again makes no sense it really is a waste of time and money to buy this dvd i believe 90% of anyone who buys this dvd would not also be disappointed with their purchase after viewing
