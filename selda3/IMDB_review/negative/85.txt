this movie based on an amazing book and was drawn into a dramatic and hyper realistic screenplay by spielberg before that script was ultimately butchered into this movie by christopher nolan read the summary of the original script  it is such a good idea for a movie space sex? how cool what we have with interstellar is crying in space every character gets at least one long crying scene its too much the soundtrack is repetitive and exhausting the dialogue is bland the backstory is weak and i could go on but none of this is my real grip with interstellar i think the movie is unrealistic but not in a physics of space isnt real enough kinda way  which is the complaint most people have when saying this movie is unrealistic i thought the characters were unrealistic i just couldnt believe that they believed we hadnt gone to the moon in a day when traveling to saturn as a species is possible i couldnt believe that matthew mcc would be so emotionally weak yet be able to hack a predator drone on the fly and be an expert farmer and an expert pilot i couldnt believe the length that the characters would go to in order to deceive eachother now for the technology  i am okay with it being a little off but the inconsistency is what is tough to swallow but you saw regular normal ol saturn rocket boosters needed to get off of earth yet they could zip around near a black hole with gravity 8000 times that of earth with tiny little engines? they have artificial intelligence capable of reliable and supercomplex reasoning with extremely strong limbs and they chose to give it a refrigerator for a chassis?
