 ok so i saw this movie on dvd last weekend and after those long 200 minutes i still cant understand all the hype and hoopla associated with it and being called the greatest trilogy of films of all time ill be the first guy to agree that the visual effects are amazing and they blew me away and directing a fantasy tale like this is a colossal task but i cant comprehend this movie getting 11 oscars probably because there werent too many strong candidates this year it deserved every award in the visual effects category but best editing cmon now im sure they could have done a lot better than 200 minutes after watching it for awhile the plots if i may call them seem to repeat themselves its just another new breed of evil guys creatures with new out of this world names and our heroes get past them imho mystic river was a better movie and deserved the best motion picture for the year i dont think the academy should give best picture award to a movie just for its visual effects dont get me wrong im really not trying to bash this movie but i really cant see why this is rated the #3 movie of all time on imdb with the other two parts in the top 10 the only reason i can think why this movie is rated so high and other exceptional movies are falling in the ratings is due to more people voting especially for the latest movies nowadays besides every other person has a computer these days and i wouldnt be too surprised if the younger audience preferred this visual grandeur to an intellectual movie which may be harder to grasp i personally like movies which make me use my brain for thinking and not just for watching like matrix mulholland drive sixth sense memento etc at the end of the day this is nothing but a huge fantasy tale movie which has a few human characters in the midst of grand visual effects i havent read the book but im sure the whole trilogy could have been concised to 4 5 hours instead of 9 10 hours i kinda feel that the film trilogy is over rated but thats just me ive noticed some people cant seem to accept that others dont like a particular film but after all likes and dislikes are just a matter of opinion watch the movie if you have a lot of time in hand and dont want to think too hard
