i couldnt rate any lower than 1 so i guess it gets a 1 how on earth does this stuff get green lit? i dont understand this type of movie may have been good in 1981 but in 2014 there is no excuse the plot is completely ludicrous the dialogue is horrible i think hes fragmented seriously? i found myself bursting out with laughter at the ridiculousness of the entire movie how many eye rolling minutes can you pack into a movie? id rather watch paint dry complete and utter failure i love movies i love when i watch a movie and i am reminded why i love movies it will take 23 good movies to get over the sour taste this movie left in my mouth avoid at all costs do not give them a reason to even consider making something else along these lines
