 this flick was about 15 hours too long there was more wasted time and film in this installment and none of it added anything to the production this film certainly did not deserve any of the awards that it received thankfully elijah wood only has about 25 minutes of screen time total for the entire film im so glad this trilogy is over i am also glad that i didnt go see this flick at the theater i would have felt even worse had i spent 9 bucks on a ticket for this extended play boredom fest even at 299 the dvd rental was too much at least i was able to make my own intermissions no film should be this long i cant recommend this flick for anything but an aid for when you cant get to sleep this was a three and a half hour passing of a gall stone shame on the academy for showering this tragic effort with so much gold
