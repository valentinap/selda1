dear santa could you please please please arrange to make it possible that i never have to sit through another execrable pile of utter garbage that has become the standard level of effluvium nolan seems to regularly pitch out all dressed up in its sparkly emperors new clothes? memento was astonishingly brilliant on a budget of several shillings insomnia likewise batman begins was a welcome reinvigoration of a franchise which had previously become something to ridicule and then came the seriously big budgets which exponentially reduced the credibility of any plot or story and here we are at a new cinematic low which worryingly garners this level of praise presumably because it has big special effects empty shallow bombastic unengaging risible crap ohand a new train set would be tops thanks
