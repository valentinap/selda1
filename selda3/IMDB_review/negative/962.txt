i also saw godthumb first both are eminently more watchable and enjoyable i actually do understand the characters and feel for them in both of those movies but the godfatheri just dont get why so many people say this is a great movie perhaps its to be cool and one of the crowd i was bored yes there are some powerful scenes yes the brutality was startling back then and it still works today and fits the story as opposed to the gratuitous and badly done violence in many movies yes it was also interesting to see some amazing actors at their start the story is even interesting so that i might be moved to read the book however i found the pacing too slow and the dialogue and interpersonal relationships trite and shallow im glad i finally saw this and found out it doesnt really glorify the mafia because i was not moved by anyone or empathetic with their choices im glad i finally saw it so i could say i did but i wont be watching it again i hear #2 is the bestit has to be
