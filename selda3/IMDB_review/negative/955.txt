 that was to lower its stupid ridiculously high average but to put it quite simply i hated this movie i didnt expect to like it i was only watching it for frank whaley but i hated this movie really hated with it with its various plot holes that do not make sensewatch short cuts if you want to see a decent movies about the interrelating lives of people obnoxious unsympathetic charactersi wanted to cheer when john travolta died or did he die i had no idea since the film epitomized non sense making someone died and i didnt like any of the characters with the exception of whaleys so i would still have wanted to cheer bad writing with obvious attempts at being cool and trying to have catch phrases etc etc etc i found nothing good about this film in the least so why did critics i hate when violent immoral films are regarded as daring  good film making this one sure wasnt and nominating john travolta and samuel l jackson for acting awards the first one is just absurd and the second has proven to me that he can act but the only thing he was acting in this film was obnoxious this one is up there with born on the fourth of july and do the right thing for my least favorite good movie
