***spoliers may be listed below**** maleficent is a an iconic villainous role she is one of disneys best characters cast from the dark side and when i saw the trailer i succumbed to the beauty they inlaid using jolie as the sinister evil fairy i was seduced to believing that i would be lured into a world of evil and treachery i wanted to see how evil was born and vengeance would be enacted i wanted to be able to bond with this evil force and be drawn deep into darkness rooting for the bad girl i knew it would be filled with beautiful scenes and disney magic but what i did not anticipate that the greatest treachery would be the film itself jolie can most definitely embrace evil and the moments when she is allowed to succumb to the full force of maleficent it is beautiful once you add in goldie locks however you get a recipe for disaster suddenly i might as well be in a world of pink pixie dust leprechauns and unicorns because this beautiful villain is disgraced into playing a role of a misunderstood black hearted fairy who really loved the doe eyed giggling aurora hell hath no fury than a woman scorned this should have been the driving force behind the film the beginning scenes of a youthful maleficent should have been nixed to allow more time to build a love story that was even remotely believable to fall from grace the betrayal has to be tangible and dripping with poison it must be something more than just a monologue infatuation and stolen wings they said years passed and yet i felt nothing of a bond or great love that would give birth to maleficents destiny in disneys rapunzel the mother figure who raised rapunzel from a baby never fell in love with the child as a daughter she was still greedy evil and dedicated to her path so why must the worlds most wonderful villain turn to a soft hearted godmother of a vapid child i know disney is trending this dont bet on the prince idea and thats fine i support that but reallythey thought this was no truer love if they think the king suffered by simply being tortured with the countdown till his childs demise then they are sadly mistaken that was childs play a woman changed by betrayal to the dark side has more ideas in her playbook that can make a man suffer madness would have been the king knowing that maleficent knew the entire time where aurora was hiding maleficent should have been sending him snippets of hair or visions of his daughter with the raven peering down at him while he slept he should have been physically and mentally destroyed a raving lunatic i would have rather liked to see a double treachery in the story that only the raven knew all along where aurora was and hid it from his mistress we could watch the anger burn and grow within maleficent because she wasnt able to find the child for 16 years that in the interim the raven would randomly turn into human form and it would have been those two that fell in love and the tragic day that maleficent discovers her location through some fools errand played by the three dopey fairies guarding her absconds with the child and lets the curse play out its course then i would have a mega battle scene at the edge of the forest against the king let her have her righteous moment when she takes his life all the while the king knowing his daughter is stuck in endless slumber with no hope of her being saved then during the battle the raven after escaping the battlefield leaves maleficents side to try and wake aurora when maleficent discovers her minions treachery the pain and anger at being betrayed for a second time by her own kind would fill her from the pit of her stomach up through her spine and a black fire filling her eyes transforming to the great dragon and an epic battle of good and evil which will lead to her glorious death that would have at least been something then they could have there happier ever after then all those still shots of maleficent looking like a falling angel in the glimmering sunlight would have been more picturesque more visually twisted overall i feel i paid $15 dollars for another movie funded by the prozac and xanax manufacturers that spread fallacies that evil fairies are really good vampires are not evil blood suckers and werewolves make great best friends its a snooze and a travesty if you love the traditional iconic role of maleficent remain in darkness and forget the lies the trailer told you for the glorious black dragon is covered in daffodils and pink tutus in this film
