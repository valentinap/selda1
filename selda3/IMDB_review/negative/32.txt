well theres no chance of letting any spoilers slip because i only made it about 30 minutes in before giving up i can start by saying that i was not a fan of the original series so im not comparing it to anything i just didnt like it i found it very loud and confusing way too intricate and convoluted plotwise i didnt care about any of the characters thats usually the test i give a movie just before i turn it off in the middle how would i feel if all these characters died in the very next scene? if the answer is that i wouldnt care one bit i go ahead and turn it off which is what i did here the three stars are for the special effects which looked pretty good but werent enough to keep me interested for two hours not saying it was a bad movie just saying i didnt like it
