this is one of those movies that should not have been made it is basically a d rated story with scifi thrown in to sell tickets the science is horrible so it only acts to aggravate scifi fans who assumed they would get something that is at least half researched so how is it bad? lets see they build up ai as something superhuman only to find out that it is easily foilable with a simple computer virus written in a matter of hours by a few hackers the authorities decide to collude with terrorists to combat a future perceived threat that has not actually committed any sort of crime the terrorist are basically your run of the mill antitech revolutionaries with brains the size of toe nail clippings and all happen to be scientists themselves the movie cheapens science and scientists considerably making them appear petty brutal and plain stupid which is actually incredible offensive to those who worked hard to achieve something in the field skip this movie just watch a cheap mexican soap opera it will be time better spent
