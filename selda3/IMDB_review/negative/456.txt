how disney could take a classic story involving a wonderfully evil character and make her into a victim of male abuse is beyond me its a terribly misguided attempt to influence our daughters to mistrust and find fault with men even the wonderful fairies in the original story who saved protected provided love and a good upbringing for snow white have those outstanding feminine qualities taken away from them they are reduced to bumbling caretakers who watch over her until maleficent finds her and eventually becomes her benefactor i dont think we as a society should try to right a wrong with another wrong if the powerful women in hollywood think that hollywood produces movies that portray women in less than desirable ways there is no reason to counter attack with this awful story aimed at the impressionable psyche of our children if you have concerns about your daughters and sons viewing a story about abusive men and psychologically damaged women getting revenge stay away from this movie let children have their childhood and take them to movies that are age appropriate
