i was looking forward to seeing this film but the points i would give it is nothing out of 10 everything about it is remarkable in its awfulness writing acting absolutely unconvincing and you knew what they were going to say before they said it i hope that is not the american way of life because its unreal the word they use throughout the film is awesome and whenever even the tiniest thing like batting a baseball ended up with the high five i would have been better off weeding the gardens and growing swede it would have given me a great deal more pleasure it is a film i wouldnt say is a turkey but a massive pork pie with plenty of jelly even that sounds quite nice i am always thoughtful about films i love films and the film that leaves the memory lingering is jet boy a remarkable canadian film i would give that 8510 if anybody wants to waste their time in totality get this film for £10 remember you have been warned i put the film straight in the fire
