after 4 years i still consider this the worst movie i have ever seen i have yet to watch any thing else with qts name attached to it everything about this film is annoying the presence of the ubiquitous sam jackson and steve buscemi the weak attempts at shock value the cameo by the director but the one element that makes this number one on my all time worst list is the obnoxious dialogue that tries to be hip and funny threes company reruns have better dialogue and i hate that show its such a shame though because qt and i do have a lot of the same obscure tastes in movies my advice is to try a project that tries not to be shocking funny or hip because pulp fiction fails in all three departments miserably
