i wont try to write an outline of the film others have done a good job of that here already ill just confine myself to observing my own reaction to it this is one poor movie due to the buildup i expected something pretty good my enthusiasm went progressively downhill as i watched the story develop and when ed norton performs the revealing scene which i suppose i should not describe here i felt like pulling the tape out right there i was that insulted i am struck with jaw dropping amazement at the vote results here in imdb what possible value does this movie have to place it higher than so many great films in the top 250 list i have a feeling that this flick speaks to the 16 to 21 year old male the same group that the worlds armies traditionally love to make eager immortal uncritical soldiers from i would like to see a demographic breakdown of the registered voters in imdb i get the impression that a hoard of enthusiastic male youths flooded the imdb with high votes immediately after the release of this puerile tale oh well if you want to vote this sloppy trash highly knock yourself out
