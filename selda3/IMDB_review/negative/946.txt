pulp fiction is one of those movies you feel uncomfortable to talk about in negative terms since mainstream loves it the real killer of this movie are the dialogs supposedly so cool but instead being silly and irritating from the very first scene when endless minutes are waisted talking about a frivolous argument the violence in this film rather strong is very often disturbing but never fun or entertaining tarantino takes himself a little too seriously making the movie lose most of its ironical aspect unless you are a fan that goes wild for the overweight travolta you will find his so called cult scenes dull and of no interest all the characters in this movie are exaggerated and that wouldnt be a bad thing but they also are not fun there are some good action scenes very few which anyhow will not save from failure a movie that lasts 2hrs 40min
