well well  hearing angelina jolie utter those words had me excited maleficent is a sight to behold shes tall menacing strong and subtly powerful alas if only her movie was as sharp as her cheekbones a lot has happened on the journey from script to screen and the film has suffered for it we are left with the shreds of rewrites maleficent is the latest in the line of postwicked take on stories where the villain gets the chance to reveal the motivation behind their actions except this isnt maleficents account of sleeping beauty  this is a completely different tale and frankly a tale i dont care for the film ticks off its mandatory checklist spinning wheel  check spoilers ahead in a shockingly emotional turn of events the film successfully gives maleficent reason for her villainy the film treads an unexpected and onpoint metaphor for rape which catapults us into that iconic christening scene from the animated film jolie is perfect in these scenes maleficents curse is delivered with strength gusto and conviction but this conviction for the original tale doesnt last long enough after comfortably placing the audience within the context of sleeping beauty the film sharply deviates from its source and leaves the audience stranded three fairies  check why tarnish what we loved so dearly? disneys three endearing fairies flora fauna and merryweather are replaced by ridiculously unfunny pixies knotgrass flittle and thistlewit theyre weak stupid and mean who would have thought aurora was entrusted to these three for protection? the three pixies dont care for the baby and so instead of searching for 16 years for the one she cursed maleficent finds herself watching over aurora elle fanning as her reluctant fairy godmother scratching your head yet? true loves kiss  check the film wastes too much time showing fairies slapping one another yes its that variety of comedy to properly set up the love story between prince phillip and aurora the writers think it suitable to set up a surprise ending whereby phillips kiss does not work in awakening the princess i dont have to reveal who does wake the sleeping beauty but its a cheap resolution that has become a new clich so in an misguided effort in juggling the roles of the characters maleficent has ended up being terribly muddled most notably the pixies and king stefan who after not seeing his daughter for 16 years banishes her to her bedroom with not so much as an hello before acting out violently against one said pixie jolie and fanning do well with what theyre given but what is given is not what was wanted where is the evil maleficent we loved? all that is left with an illjudged feminist romance maleficent is an adult film correctly rated m for its themes and violence that has childish characters that could only appeal to fouryearolds it is indeed a sleeping beauty  a visually superb film that failed to awake to the possibilities of what it could have been
