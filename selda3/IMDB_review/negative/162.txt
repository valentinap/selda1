the good reviews made me watch the movie full out and this was one of the worst hours spent in my life i really have no clue how people can enjoy this movie only if it resonates with an interest for the mundane mediocre average life the movie has not one interesting plot twist the main character is an uninspiring slow paced cynical person his sister is also not a very interesting person to watch the dialogs are just average everyday conversations if this movie gets an oscar i seriously have my doubts about the voting system life can be an uplifting experience the whole movie seems to portray that life is a long string of events to which you have very little influence and the only thing you have left to do is wait and sit out life to me it is incomprehensible to take 12 years and come up with this very disappointing view on life and play it out so boringly there is one scene that actually touched me a plumber reflects back on a lifes lesson he got from one of the main characters and how this positively shaped his life simply said it is a waste to watch this movie
