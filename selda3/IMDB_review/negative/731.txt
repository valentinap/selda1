rotk is one of the most hyped movies of all time i think that it is also the most personally disappointing movie i have ever watched i was so excited to see this film i was left with a bitter taste in my mouth the first blow came when instead of showing the white wizard sauromans demise we open the film with something from the hobbitgollums backstory this made me mad because i was told that sauroman was cut because they didnt want to dwell on two towers apparently they didnt mind dwelling on the hobbit so what you have in return of the king is a villianous army with no general no main villian save for sauron who is only in the film as a spirit only what you have as the main villian is a bunch of stunt guys in very good costumes the action is fine in the film but aragorn just doesnt sell his part well imho his leaving to find the ghost army is waaaaaaay understated legolas and gimli are made into nothing more than his stooges who look assuringly at him whenever he has doubt frodo sam gollum on the other hand give great performances and are the only bright spot of the film although i think sheloub was a huge disappointment and did not live up to the hype preceding the film the ghost army looks like scooby doo animators drew it and the action scenes involving them are all wide sky shots where you cant see what is going on the multiple endings are also a plod along as the movie stops starts stops starts and finally comes to a end long after i was ready to leave the movie just overall disappointed me greatly
