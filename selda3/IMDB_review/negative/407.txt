i heard a lot of squealing about this movie and expected better but its very conventional and follows the same ol story arc as movies it is supposedly mocking the characters are a tad snide and make a few quips but other than that this movie is extremely middleofthe road the only lead character with any screen presence was the big wrestler guy as for the lead if that dude walked by me on the street i totally would not recognize him no star power here no screen presence zoe saldana is starting to get typecast as space babe she should take another kind of role soon bradley coopers character was downright annoying an angry little animated character is not new or groundbreaking we dont even get a dynamic bad guy people everyone knows that if you want your movie to be kickass you have to make your bad guy dynamic weirdly sexyor at the very least british this is known as the alan rickman principle this bad guy was just some weird blue dude who apparently drooled a lot while eating black licorice and forgot to wipe his mouth off this movie is a giant hohum
