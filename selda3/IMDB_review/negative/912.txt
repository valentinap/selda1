 saying this is the #2 movie of all time is like saying mcdonalds makes the best hamburgers theyre both palatable predictable inoffensive products that are easy to digest both have happy endings that is if you find the stunning speed with which a mcdonalds hamburger flushes out your digestive tract to be a happy occasion all you need to know is that shawshank has the exact same ending as trading places so why not make trading places the greatest comedy of all time what the hell why not make it #3 on imdb it too is competent and utterly middle of the road in terms of quality and originality within its genre instead of dan ackroyd and eddie murphy laughing it up on a caribbean beach after besting the forces of evil we get morgan freeman and tim robbins its the exact same ending shawshank was ok when i saw it when it came out but count me among the backlash group that would rather see it with the 6 7 rating that it deserves thusly i hereby cast my symbolic 1 star vote
