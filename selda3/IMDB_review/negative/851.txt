this movie has toppled all the records and currently ranked number 1 on imdb rankings this really makes me doubt about how imdb ranking works and are we the people so gullible to the advertisement campaigns that we have rated this film this high i must say this that the film as such is not bad it is the best film so far this year however it does not qualify to even come near to other masterpieces if it is not for heath ledgers excellent performance i would have rated this film even lower to tell the truth i liked the prequel of this film better the film is lengthy and melodramatic eg the scene where inmates and civilians want to decide if they want to blow off other ship message was good but the way it was delivered is little bit childish also transformation of harvey dent seems sudden and illogical nolan should have developed this character better if harvey does what he does after the death of his beloved he should be avenging joker the most important part where joker convinces him to be an anarchist just like him is written poorly all in all it is a good movie excuse me but far from masterpiece
