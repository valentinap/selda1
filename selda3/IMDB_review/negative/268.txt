like its protagonist kenneth branaghs liveaction adaptation of the disney animated classic cinderella proves to be little more than a dull vapid mess covered up by a sparkly blue dress and no amount of computergenerated mice slapstick pumpkins or good old fashioned bonham carter charm can save it once again director branagh shows that the only thing he does better than shakespeare is soulless cgi spectacle everyone is familiar with the cinderella story and being that this particular iteration makes no effort to diverge from the triedtrue fairy tale anyway this critic shall not waste any time in summarizing it to be brief heroine ella _ cinderella being a derogatory nickname cooked up by her endlessly irritating stepsisters _ is left in the care of her heinous stepmother after both of her parents contract a horrible case of plot device and die there is a prince a fairy godmother a slipper and a happily ever after the entirety of the story is narrated incessantly by helena bonham carters fairy godmother character and while i do not mind listening to the sound of ms carters lovely voice for two hours this demonstrates the films absolute obliviousness to the tenant of show dont tell to branaghs credit it must not be easy to craft a sensible film while working off of such a droll script _ under the pen of chris weitz esteemed writer of such masterpieces as the golden compass and the nutty professor ii _ while simultaneously being wrung through the dread corporate machine that is disney still the composition of this film displays a surprising level of incompetence people slide down doors in despair slippers can be shattered by stepmothers but left unscathed by a tumble down the stairs and the characters seem to feel the need to babble incessantly about their feelings our cinderella is here a blubbering counterfeministic clod who spends an inordinate amount of time either weeping or pining over her man lily james embodies the very image of a breathless exhaustingly optimistic idiot with her constant empty smiles and flighty gestures ella lives her life under her mothers dying tenant to always have courage and be kind which evidently translates to be a cheerful and willing servant to your abusive stepfamily thus ella is enslaved not only by her wicked stepmother but by her blood mother as well ella puts blind loyalty to authority figures over her own happiness and wellbeing thus becoming a perfect rolemodel to young women speaking of wicked stepmothers cate blanchett as the evil lady tremaine lends a subtlety and nuance to the role that might be compared to that of a bull in a china shop of course how else can the audience tell that the stepmother is bad if she doesnt follow every act of overthetop wanton cruelty with a smirk and a malevolent chuckle? the films saving grace comes unsurprisingly in the form of helena bonham carter whose light and incredibly fun portrayal of ellas fairy godmother makes for a very watchable ten minutes in the middle of the film carter fills the screen with her presence and certainly woke this critic out of his nearcatatonic state of boredom even making weitzs trite wooden dialogue feel clever of course when it comes down to it this is a spectacle movie and on that end it lives up the use of cgi animals is obvious and often unnecessary _ im sure that they still make real deer mr branagh _ and the magic of the movie is unfortunately limited to the fairy godmothers standout scenes in the middle but the effects are nevertheless detailed and fun to watch the film is an absolute parade of lovely costumes designed by sandy powell especially the endless supply of bizarre yet beautiful outfits worn by blanchett patrick doyles score is grandiose and seems to be struggling to carry the emotional weight of the film as the actors clearly are not making any effort to do so in all this is a largely forgettable flick that trudges on through an uninspired and clich_d retelling of a story that has been told far too many times already without any fresh offerings or inspiring rolemodels even children are sure to be unimpressed by this obviously mechanical piece of cold corporate cashin
