the movie was recommended to me by a friend who saw the reviews and somehow believed those huge mistake to say the movie is childish would be an honor for this movie i have seen plenty of animated movies which were a huge lot better the story is dumb and entirely predictable the characters are almost flat and have absolutely no credibility from either a serious point of view nor from a parody point of view acting was also poor visual effects were ok and being a 3d movie helped but that is the only positive thing that i can say about the movie the theater was halffull but during the entire movie there was not a single time when you could hear everybody laughing hard the only way i can imagine that so many 9 and 10 star reviews were added for this movie is since all the brainwashed marvel fanboys and sockpuppets for the studios somehow managed to overwhelm normal reviewers
