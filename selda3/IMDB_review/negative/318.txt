im very disappointed the script the direction the stiff acting by rebecca hall paul bettany and kate mara ive also seen enough of morgan freeman to last two life times please stop already i wish i had my two hours of watch time back so i wouldnt feel so cheated and used poor johnny depp ive seen this movie in one form or the other from years ago junk it up with cgi computer magic doesnt make the script any better maybe the players would be a bit more believable if i wasnt able to say their lines as they were said on the screen the bad guys wereeveryone in my book
