we were expecting a new perspective like maleficent huge disappointment we should have realized from the trailers but thats what we get for assuming disney was starting a reboot trend i cant believe my wife leaned over half way through the movie and said im ready to go when you are we were not expecting gore and dismay but we were hoping for a fresh perspective other than adding more footage of the animals if your kids or you have never seen a cinderella movie then its great if youre tired of movies being remade every few years then this is not for you the actors did an amazing job with this rendition however im tired of seeing the same movie over and over with new actors id imagine that its like being a drama teacher in high school first time seeing cinderella = 8 oh nice job cinderella again? = 3 what was disney thinking? so yes the fact that a company needs a revenue income provided by a script that they dusted off from the shelf will flock people to the box office caught us hook line and sinker
