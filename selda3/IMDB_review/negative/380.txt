i remember seeing this movie in the theater after that i saw it at least once on vhs maybe twice i picked up the bluray of this used from a blockbuster that was closing ive been more interested in seeing spyaction movies recently and it seemed like something i should revisit i wish i hadnt bought it there are so many problems with this movie nearly all of which have to do with the script first i dont care about anyone on the team cruise doesnt come across as having a personality and he doesnt behave like a skilled agent everyone else in the cast seems to be disposable second the plot had potential to be an interesting story provided that the story was treated a little more like the ateam with them trying to prove their innocence instead we wind up with a story where we arent positive why cruise is doing anything except for some vague idea and it comes across confusing because its hard to draw a line between his actions and his goal third because of the first two i find myself having no sense of tension or investment in the outcome of the movie i couldnt care less if cruise lives or dies the movie hasnt aged well the pacing is strange and once again computers are relegated to be magic boxes and the action sequences seem to be silly when cruise leaps from the exploding fish tank i couldnt keep from laughing the big finish fight with the train and the helicopter was not up to the same level of silliness but it was very very close now i have to figure out what to do with this bluray copy that i really will never look at again
