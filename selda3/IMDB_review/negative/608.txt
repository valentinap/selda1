ive heard many people say and seen many reviews written that fight club is a classic mind blowing completely fresh sorry but i just dont see it ill start with the positives ed norton and brad pitt were excellent pitt perfectly captures the supercool no attachments nothingtolose attitude that so many young guys have before they get old and come back down to earth norton is also perfect as the uptight frustrated yuppie bored with lifes vapidity even helena bonham carter who i normally dont much care for was okay in the generic girlfriend role now on to the negatives the story is just utterly preposterous maybe even more so than finchers last absurd movie the game the movie really lost all believability when fight club turns into the cult project mayhem although it has a nice twist ending with the pittnorton dynamic i couldnt buy that they could get legions of grown men to become such mindless fanatical followers pitts charismatic but not nearly charismatic to cover up the fact his philosophy is tired and his idea of subversion is nothing except vandalism and petty theft the movie has pretensions of making a statement about consumerism but i thought it made them pretty succintly with the intro where norton describes his perfect condo filled with things he really didnt need everything else is overkill and the final big plan to blow up i wont say what in case you havent seen the movie yet in order to level the world playing field iswellpointless just like the game fincher takes some good parts and sews them into a tapestry of mediocrity i give it 6 out of 10
