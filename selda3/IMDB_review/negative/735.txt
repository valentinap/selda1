i first saw this movie when i rented it out from my local video store i can honestly say it is the worst movie i have ever seen it doesnt even deserve the right to be called a movie i am a big fan of episodes 1 and 2 and i wasnt really disappointed with 3 but empire strikes back is just horrible the acting is dreadful the bad guys arent scary of funny and arent even both guys the kid who plays luke skywalker is dreadful and your left hoping the bad guys actually get him and strangle him the storyline is just stupid and why they decided to keep the same characters as the first two home alones is beyond me overall i have to say this movie is a big disappointment and i only gave it the rating 1 because i had to if i could give it a zero i would
