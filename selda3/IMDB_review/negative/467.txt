guardians of the craplaxy its been a while since i gave a comment about movies usually when i do its because the movie was extremely awesome or annoyingly full of cow dung i went into the theater without any idea what guardian of the galaxy had in store sometimes a movie is more enjoyable when u dont know any synopsis at all so that is what i did all i knew was that it had a good number of positive reviews and imdb had given it at least an 8 most of the time when imdb reviewers give a movie an 8 u know the movie is gonna be awesome—and nothing can or could go wrong right???? —— how wrong i mean how very very very very very wrong i was please if u r someone with a functioning brain i implore you not to go watch this garbage allow me to be the messiah when it comes to this movie— take it that i have gone to sacrifice my cash and time for u to stay away and just download it if u can—and even that make sure u download it from a place that is sharing free wifi why do u ax? why am i blasting this movie with so much ammo you ax? its simple nowhere ie weather in reality or fiction can a bunch of people always save a complex situation without coming out unscathed also i dont even know if the movie is a comedy or a thriller or action it tries woefully to emulate all 3 to no success i am gonna end here— or i will go on and on and i am trying hard not to give away spoilers but let no one say i never warned them ps there are 2 sure fire ways to watch it without having any regrets 1 going to watch it with a lady friend that you wanna score and 2 when you are high on weed these 2 ways i guarantee will make you enjoy the movie so much more
