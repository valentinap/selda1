this movie is awful the ending was longer than any battle scene the entire final battle was completely meaningless the humans might as well have stood there because the only ones that did any fighting were the ghosts very anti climatic and the ending was about 35 minutes too long even the most hardcore of fans has to agree on those two points the only good part about this movie was the final battle it seemed and then the ghosts came and completely dominated everything therefore making the previous half hour meaningless i want my 3 hours of my life back and also my ten bucks in all the action was meaningless and the movie would have been much better had it been about 2 hours long tops
