this is the dumbest movie i ever watched i felt insulted by it there is no discernible logic the script seems written by 1000 monkeysd its a pity they did this because the idea could have lead to a very intriguing and interesting story but they wasted it i didnt even worry to watch it to the end i left the theater and drove home they even wasted good actors they seemed so bored they didnt even pretend to act what were the producers and the director thinking? my recommendation dont waste your time watching this  read a book instead
