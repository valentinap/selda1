dont waste your time and money very bad acting very boring and predictable it just makes no sense i will never ever trust the ratings again ha first hour of the film is so stupid that it is funny faces that actors make unprofessional acting make the movie very very boring what else can i say i wish i stayed home with my husband ben affleck acts like it is his first movie he looks lost looks like he almost forgets the words family members also look and act like people that were taken from the street occasionally all that people look like they have no idea what is the film about im trying to understand how could this goofy movie get those ratings and i guess the answer is money because this is really really low level
