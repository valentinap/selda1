no one else ive ever talked to in person about this movie has disliked it all my friends family co workers acquaintances random strangers on the street that i pass by they all loved it not liked it a lot or thoroughly enjoyed it they loved it and i couldnt stand it honestly it made me feel like a bit of an outcast so it was with great pleasure that i found that even though this movie is on the top 10 movies on imdb there are a plethora of reviews containing exactly the same qualms i had with this film i registered with imdb just so i could post this review and lower this movies rating a tiny bit +1 to all the negative sentiments in all the negative reviews of this movie
