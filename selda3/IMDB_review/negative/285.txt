ive never seen so bad movie since indiana jones and the kingdom of the crystal skull how?how can this movie has a rating above 8?? from the beginning of the movie till the end all you see is a mess childish plot childish characters and awful awful humor all the times  even in the serious and important scenes theres always a stupid joke to ruin the momentwhich is already ruined but anyway countless clichs and a story so bad that made me burn many many brain cells the cgi where just ok and the fight scenes were at best indifferentthere were also some slomo scenes with nothing really to offeri mean its like a guy jumping in slow motionseriouslynothing cool about it nothing newnothing about this movie is new or original i have nothing else to say for this moviestay away
