watched 2001 space od instead how can this film get a higher score on imdb than a classic proper sci film and not some family drama stretched out and a bit of futuristic spice i can only think this gets such a high rating due to viewers not seeing old films and being won over by modern day bandwagons to jump on also the lead character is so wooden he acts like a 2 by 4 and he mumbles his stiffly delivered bits this would not matter in a proper scifi film but here in this melodrama masquerade it does matter or really it doesnt matter this is over rated tripe
