 its not often i find a movie plain unwatchable but that was the case with the dark knight the reason is plain and simple almost every dialog feels fake as only 1 person speaks per camera point like with cheap soaps where they can only take care of the sound of one person or where the stars dont physically meet that much the lack of chemistry and realness resulting from monologues shot in series an then cut to dialogs is bewildering staggering low quality i honestly found it unwatchable because of that and whats even more bewildering is that this seemingly cheap or ill produced production is considered a master piece by so many i feel like the little child in the emperors new clothes whats going on here has everyone turned blind shockingly bad
