i really like nolan and like all of its films until i saw interstellar the movie has its moments but in between those moments there is lot of time waste this is one movie that i really wanted to see but in between the movie i was thinking when is this going to get over i think nolan could not decide between making a scifi movie and an emotional movie he has given an average movie and because its a nolan movie i have given it a 1star i know it doesnt really deserve 1star but then i am angry with imdb there is no way it should be rated 9 i think lately imdb has become a hub where marketing people raise the rating through any means available disappointed in nolan and imdb too
