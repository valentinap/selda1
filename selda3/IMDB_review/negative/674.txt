while the first two films of the trilogy where very good in my opinion the third one is a complete catastrophe in every aspect one can think of its attitude towards the book and without the book no one would have heard of peter jackson except few admirers moves between insult to ignorance almost no text from the original survives and the characters and scenes are terribly distorted even the climax scene is changed from the genius of tolkien to a bad holiwoodic clichܩ the most disastrous is what the movie does to the character of frodo which from the original tragic hero becomes a stupid and gullible fellow which does nothing expect stupid things the go home sam scene should be candidate to one of the worse movie scenes ever other characters such as denethor faramir aragorn theoden or elrond are either inconsistent irrational stupid badly acted or all of the above in addition unlike the beautiful design of the middle earth in general in the first movie or of rohan in second there is nothing left from gondor except one picture of minas tirith and few fires it amazes me that not only this film is considered excellent by many viewers but that it is considered the best of the three
