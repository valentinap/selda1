i have read other reviews of this movie and i think that my outlying grossly negative opinion may have something to do with the fact that i do not identify at all with this movie i am proud to say this it is sad that so many people did see something of themselves in this movie i feel truly sorry for you it was obviously never this movies intent to be entertaining or to make you care about the characters humanity or society
