i must admit that this movie should receive the trophy of anthem of a generation for incredible bad movies of the new era of film making first time ive heard of this movie was from a friend who told me and i quote man this movie is on the top of imdb list we have to see it so i did see it i was expecting something great but after one hour i was sick of it and left the room it is non stop action with no script nothing at allall you see and hear in this movie is bum bumbang bang and not even some clich‹© lines nothing artistic the only plots in this movie are kinder garden plots and they are tied in an anarchic structurethe only reason to look at this movie is to see special effects and cgibatman begins is a much better movie than this one christian bales performance was less than mediocre even if everyone praised him for reinventing the character of batmanit brings nothing new the batman concept the only actor who did something was heath ledger joker you would probably ask why is rated so highthe answer is that the marketing and the propaganda did a great job infusing in people minds the idea that this is a good movie plus the rating of a movie it is mostly subjective and when you say that a movie costs $180 million and it has all of this presumed great actors people will say gee that is a great movie and the critics do you think that they are honorable people who rate movies with objectivity for the good of the people of course not they have to sell the newspapers they work forand once i asked an american friend why do you listen to a popular band at that time and he said because it is what is cool now and what people listen i dont agree with him so when you rate a movie listen to your inner self not others
