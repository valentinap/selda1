am i the only one on planet earth who thinks that this film is absolute tosh? perhaps im being unkind because i could only handle an hour before walking out i thought the acting in particular was very poor the storyline is twaddle  a farmer with flight experience finds nasa in an unspecified location with a rocket that is going to save earth  a typecast michael caine thank goodness it wasnt morgan freeman opens the boardroom door and there is the rocket it seemed to me that used actual rocket launch footage? the time element is misused and the special effects are not that great i thought elysium knocked socks off this film i did semi enjoy the water sequence but it was at the point where they get back to the mother ship that i walked  very quickly out of the cinema ps i love matthew mcconaughey in true detective and i cant believe i was looking at the same actor
