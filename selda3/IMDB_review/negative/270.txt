let me start by saying that i have enjoyed christopher nolans work in the past memento insomnia parts of the batman trilogy i find him a very talented filmmaker with strong ideas and visual sense therefore it makes me very sad to state that categorically this is an absolute turkey in many places the plot is so full of holes that you can do little but laughout loud there will be reviewers on here talking about depth intimations of mortality etc etc forget it this is just a total misfire actors used to say despairingly that they were playing johnny exposition  you know the guy who explains everything to the audience note i said despairingly this has almost every character explaining everything from wormholes to the mystery of love oh yeah after a totally boring drawnout beginning which seems to be there to prove that nolan has watched the grapes of wrath many times over we get the first huge laugh when we meet sir michael caine with a laughable posh  cockney  american accent he is playing the part that sam shephard in this or morgan freeman usually play he is not up to it never was never will be it takes a certain amount of skill to be able to deliver line after line of pseudoscientific gobbledygook and make it sound real caines performance  like so many of his performances  screams out wheres my bleedin paycheck? when coop gary cooper  westerns  get it agrees to fly this practically suicidal mission to the outer reaches of space he blasts off like a cosmic cowboy all bravado and charisma  at which point his fellow crew member shows him  with a pen and paper  what a wormhole is yes when he is leading a flight into outer space a little late doncha think? it gets worse when poor anne hathaway playing as my son said  science girl has to recite a monologue about love and how it can cross all dimensions of space time blah blah blah i really felt for her i wont expand on the plot i couldnt if i wanted to and the last 30 minutes have to be seen to be disbelieved this is not one of those films that you see and forget immediately you will wake up in a few months time laughing at michael caines last scene or his recital of dylan thomas famous lines  not once but twiceand the end oh the end mcconaghey gives it his all having to cry on more than one occasion  believe me i know how he felt dont believe anyone if they tell you you didnt get it thats like saying you didnt get an episode of two and a half men ambitious yes but a turd is a turd  even if they meant to produce a new hybrid rose
