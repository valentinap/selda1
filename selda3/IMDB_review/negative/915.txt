i was expecting to see at least a semi good movie but this film is not even up to par this film gets a 1 rating from me because it tries to depict batman and fails miserably at it even for an action movie if batman hadnt been in it its not good the plot is horrid and morbid the amount of gore unhealthy and the fight sequences are badly done notable problems a what is this rock theme music thats constant in the movie it comes whenever a suspense scene starts and sounds like an annoying electric guitar what is this doing in a batman film also the plot seems to be totally disconnected in between scenes the entire movie is like one big mishmash of 10 different stories that occur in succession it is also unrealistic many times in the beginning the joker simply takes his schoolbus into the convoy to escape and the way he avoids police in broad daylight and blows up the hospital is unbelievable b the joker in this film is someone with a predilection for violence and violence alone traditionally the joker has been a nefarious insane character he does things that are out of kilter with normalcy he then laughs at what he does and takes unexpected delight in it this joker is not like so hes simply a disturbed psychopath who likes to blow up things and harm others theres no depth to the character c harvey dent has been traditionally black the last 2 decades that and the way hes made into two face in this movie is totally wrong two face traditionally goes on to become a crime boss but in this movie he simply dies soon after coming into being he also isnt a good two face overusing his coin flip to make decisions for example in the limousine scene he flips the coin again and kills the driver in order to eliminate a crime boss the real two face wouldnt have cheated like this once the coin makes a decision for him d batman himself doesnt appear much in the movie we are shown glimpses of him and the fight scenes are very darkly lit so its hard to see who and how hes fighting his over reliance on technology is also not good because batman usually uses wits as well as brawn the voice of batman is guttural sounding and bruce wayne himself doesnt seem to have any emotions micheal keatons portrayal of batman in batman made in 1989 is by far the best in all movies the dark knight is not just not a good batman film its a poor film in any genre i recommend watching batman 1989 if one wants to see an excellent batman film heres a small sample from this great movie thats better than the entire the dark knight http wwwyoutubecom watchv=sc249jpbbdy
