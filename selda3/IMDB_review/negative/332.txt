if you are a big fan of the television series starring peter graves and martin landau like i am then you will hate this movie as much as i did it has nothing to do with the television series other than its title and opening musical sequence i went in to this movie expecting more if you can get beyond these prejudices then you can expect at best a mediocre movie right off the top of my head i can pick five or six episodes from the series that were actually better than this movie its a shame because i like tom cruse hes better than this
