it started out funny like the previews showed with only a little graphic violence ill give it that then it started getting extremely graphic mass murders heads exploding our whole family of 5 adults were so disturbed we couldnt even talk all the way home we all wish we could unsee it i felt it was a terrible movie even with the few chuckles we got in the earlier parts this movie taught me a lesson i will not be seeing any more movies in the theater without reading every review i can get my hands on this isnt the first time i have been blind sighted by gore and disturbing content if you see this movie i beg you not to take your kids even if they are adults i wish i could go back and not have gone to this one frankly i am disappointed that movie makers feel americans have sunk so low as to find this entertaining
