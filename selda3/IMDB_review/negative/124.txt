there are people out there who can write a half decent script and dont get the opportunity to ever have it heard there are people out there who have serious acting skill and never get seen there are scifi movies that have an original story that dont have a budget to be released at their full potential support people with talent and original ideas do not see guardians of the galaxy as it contains nothing that vaguely resembles any of those things congratulations on nailing the cgi though guys that was great if i felt like staring at great cgi for two and a half hours though id play call of duty
