the only thing that amazes me about this movie is that it is not only within 500 top movies in imdb but actually #2 and soon perhaps #1 i only saw shawshank redemption once and have not been able to force myself to watch it in full length ever since it was ok to see it once even though i was almost bored then but not quite i found it very average in every respect and quite predictable i guess that this is one of those movies that is so average that it does not bother anybody by invoking powerful emotions thoughts or memories and does not have any obviously bad technical quality just sooo average hence the high score
