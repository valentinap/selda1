 this movie is not great its barley border line good the only two reason i cant think this was rated so high was the extremely high budget on 3d animation and the fact that people are so easily enticed by the name and actors now i am not insulting the books as i have never read them but other than what i stated what makes this movie so great is it the acting i dont really think orlando bloom can preform any other role take a look at both the lord of the rings and pirates of the caribbean is it climax i think even the people who didnt even read the book knew that from the first half of the first movie knew that the ring would be destroyed is it the characters it had all the basic characters for all movie storyline the only entertaining and not bland character was golem what is it that makes you think its in the league with schindlers list and casablanca i dont claim to know what the best movie ever is but i know this movie dose not rank high in greatness it only high in its budget
