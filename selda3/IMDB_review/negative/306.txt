it is beyond me how people can claim the movie to be brainy intelligent well written with all the things i read about the movie prior to seeing it makes it the biggest disappointment ive experienced from cinema in years i give 1 star to bring balance to the current rating in reality this movie is of course not that bad the whole idea behind the plot is that mcconaughey ended up in this blackhole where 5 dimensions were compressed into 3 dimensions and stuff and where he was able to manipulate gravity by sending his daughter the message which was imperative for saving humanity so what in fact happened is through this ridiculously improbable chain of events mcconaughey ended up inside this blackhole all this was apparently the result of a bigger plan all along was there really no easier way for future humansaliens to transmit this data and if they built this timespace warping machine inside the blackhole  means they had access to the data all along? and also means they chose mcconaughey daughter on purpose? so i dont understand what was this purpose? could they not have connected their portal to professors office a long time ago or go for one of the ten billion more rational alternatives? on a side note is it not funny how mcconaughey ignored the message not to go from the same ghost yet followed the rest of the directions? while in the end of the movie he idiotically repeats his feeble attempt had he added its you dad or any other sensible hint he would have saved his daughter years of suffering and maybe a lifetime for himself when he realises this and i dont even want to get into how ridiculous it is that he transmitted data by moving the hands on the watch which was unaffected after being picked up meaning it was hardly gravitational manipulation was it? what was the point of trying to be scientific and trying to explain it in this way then if he could do that he ought to have found a better solution that did not require his daughter 25 years to figure out and anyway they saved humanity by building this massive station named after his daughter by that time they knew what he went through and they still named it after her? why couldnt they have done the same thing on earth? just build the same goddamn station on earth without needing to harvest their gravitational energy bullsh*t bam humanity saved in the same way grand ideas dont make great movies if you cant deliver them properly it is atrocity to compare this to kubricks masterpiece
