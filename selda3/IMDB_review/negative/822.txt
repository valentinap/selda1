humm i saw this film before batman begins and possibly it has better special effects i have only seen the first one it bits but and its a big but this film is very much a perfect example of what is wrong with contemporary cinema its garbage truly appreciate the quality of tim burtons batman by first watching this cart of steaming plops you might be the kind of person that doesnt give a fig about what you watch or you just want to see pure spectacle this film has spectacle and then more spectacle and then just as you are trying to follow what happened and possibly work out that the film is not that great something else will happen end result is a kind of mood average at that rather than any cohesive enjoyment in fact it is probably a bit worse than that even tawdry
