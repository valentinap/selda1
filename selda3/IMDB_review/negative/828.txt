even though i see these films as pseudo intellectual tripe intentionally made for popcorn peasants who equate style with substance and gravity with gravitas i think there is a something to take seriously about the effect the series is having on less psychologically stable individuals here is the problem no one really wants to equate horrific social acts with the ideal of liberty or the influence of the arts this is a problem because it is the essence of rational thinking to question aspects of our condition such as the possibility that the very things we hold dear are the things that can hurt and scar us the deepest there are droves of people willing to attack religious texts as a direct influence on violent behavior but seemingly few people who will even dare suggest that films can affect behavior in a similar manner yes religious writings are presented as truth where films are generally not but to a person lost in psychological disease there is probably little difference between truth and fiction the dark knight is a film where the central antagonist is presented as highly charismatic and successful in his purposes he is given a significant amount of screen time several stylized monologues and essentially tears apart all semblance of morality and meaning the protagonists cherish the joker is a glamorized nihilist antihero who wins in the end he is given all of the best lines is never contradicted and almost all of the filmmakers intentions seem to be focused on this one singular performance above and beyond all others he is also however impossible a creation a realistically and seriously portrayed one much like se7ens john doe or silence of the lambs hannibal lecter the joker is the ultimate role model for people who are antisocial insecure and disturbed he has been crafted with care and projected into the minds of any and everyone living in a society that is reeling from media saturation and spiritual and moral confusion like it or not we are animals living in a self made zoo and we are dramatically influenced by the media and artistic expressions we are exposed to from infancy through our development into adulthood at which point we remain spectators or begin to color the depths with our own dreams and nightmares but profiting egotistically and or financially from cathartic or theoretical expressions of violent and socially conflicted issues without acknowledging the potential for negative influence and therefore the serious social responsibility of such expressions is the way of our post modern world it is reckless and selfish and it is the american way i understand that the director of this film is british but the dark knight is clearly designed for an american audience we dont want to have any restrictions on our public fantasies as producers or voyeurs we are afraid of the assumed slippery slope from censorship to fascism and we hold the ideal of freedom above even the quality of our own lives we are taught not to value sacrifice and to drink deep from the abyss because we are irrational animals first and our morals are those of convenience we are not culpable because we are unaware given absolutely incontrovertible empirical evidence that films can desensitize demoralize and cause specific acts of violence to occur would we be willing to sacrifice our entertainment and our liberty for the welfare of the whole of the species absolutely not and why should we but we are not in control of anything we are not free at all and our ideals are no more empirically substantial than our religious beliefs the only solution for those of us who are aware and concerned with societal health is to attempt to illuminate others and force an acknowledgment of these realities so that we can attempt to cope with the inevitable moral decay mass secularism and technological progression are causing not that i could ever demystify the joker character for those who find him heroic or impressive beyond the superficiality of the actors performance but as an afterthought i am adding something i produced as a reaction to the disturbing level of influence the character has had on people because honestly speaking the character is an idiot for whatever it is worth the interrogation scene between batman and the joker in an actual intellectual though overly verbose film joker bla bla bla nihilistic bs bla bla darwinian pseudo truth bla bla sociopathic nonsense masquerading as deep social truism bla bla bla‰Û_ batman heres the truth pal we are both chemically drawn to opposing behaviors which we ultimately have little or no control over you are compelled to associate civilized humans as violent animals living a lie of illusory morals and to enjoy causing negative awareness and pain i am compelled to see humans as violent but altruistic animals by nature and to help heal the whole by attacking those who cause disease and pain like fighting cancerous cells in a body even as you mock the species for a perceived moral dishonesty you must rely on a type of moral perspective in order to justify your own position over the position of another your attempt to call people out on being flawed animals simply because you have a more introspective awareness is simply an appeal to your chemical predestination over the nature of others you have no point to make moral or otherwise once you have chosen to eliminate the idea of meaning from existence you are no different than a moth drawn to a flame you possess no special knowledge from which you can imagine me detracted from my own goals if anything i am more honest in my attempts to herd the flock into healthier areas of behavior because we are biologically a social species and biology is our master then batman smashes the jokers face into the table to drive his point home
