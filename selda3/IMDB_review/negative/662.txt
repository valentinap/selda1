without the use of computer graphics this film would not be worth the price of a cheap bargain day 3 for 1 special rental at the local video store true the locations and cinematography add to the film however heaven forbid that the cast should either have to act or in the case of the veteran actors overact cg removed and this thespian in name only grouping are woefully short of the depth and quality characterization brought forth in the classic book the direction is sporadic and the pace is inconsistent leaving little to the imagination why so much of the budget was spent on computer technicians instead of acting lessons sorry for all those who jumped on the lemming band wagon for this one but lift your heads above middle earth and return to the land of the living
