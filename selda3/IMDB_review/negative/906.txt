 i think it is the worst film ive seen in a long time and ive seen the original star warsthe characters are so annoying and i wished they all died at the end of the film i wised orlando blooms character legalos would be shot in the face with an arrow by lurtz also i think aragon should get a hair cut and have a shave because ll you see is hair also what is up with that little guy gimli he is so annoying he makes little jokes which are not even funny during a supposedly serious film the group always overact about everything what is the point of leglos saying blood has been spilt this night and walking right up to the camera this look very mincy how did it win best film award how did it win any awardalso the other two films were just as bad they could have cut the films lengths by half if they did not put in so much pointless chatter it would also help if they had real actors and did not rely on cgi so much
