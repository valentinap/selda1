i was so utterly disgusted with one scene that it compelled me to write this review my first oneever okay so to begin with i thoroughly enjoyed the film prior to the last 20 mins it was highly entertaining humorous in bits and the lead actor did an amazing job i did feel however that due to the amount of foul language and over the top violence in one particular scene at a church that it lost one point this movie wouldve made it on my top rated list so youre probably wondering what was so terrible that it completely ruined the movie for me so let me tell you now bear in mind that i am a woman in my mid 30s and not conservative by all means but there is a scene in the movie where eggsy the main character is propositioned by an imprisoned princess what is so wrong with that you ask? nothinghad she not offered her ahole in exchange for him saving the world why? it completely took me off guard and cheapened the entire film it was completely unnecessary and utterly distasteful such a shame because it was such a great film too
