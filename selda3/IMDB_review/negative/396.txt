i may be too harsh giving guardians of the galaxy such a poor rating but i have to be honest this movie is garbage i suspect that the people who give it such high praises are nothing but marvel fanboys gotg is boring really really boring the movie tries to be funny but falls flat with one bad joke after another rocket raccoon who is obviously supposed to be the funniest character since he is the most sarcastic and has the most oneliners is painfully unfunny anyway i laughed a little bit at the beginning the rest of the time i stared blankly at the screen periodically glancing at my watch the action sequences only contributed to the boringness of the movie why? theres no risk to the main characters it is obvious that they wont be killed the danger is never convincing enough to raise the pulse guardians of the galaxy is a bad movie
