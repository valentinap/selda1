this movie just made me sad  i was sad for the ruined original story sad because of the terrible writing and predictable plot but most of all sad for all the actors and staff who invested time and energy into this absolute disaster of a movie theres a lot of talent here to work with unfortunately it was all wasted the movie looks fake and fabricated which of course it was there was little real cinematic effort with every environment and most of the characters being cgi there was very little for the actors to interact with as a result we the audience get yet another generic and artificial theme park ride sadly we get so many of those nowadays that instead of making us smile they make us sick i think the movie was ultimately about women empowerment which worked perfectly fine in frozen here though the message was pushed over the idea of true love  a classic motive in almost all fairy tales and child stories so was it worth it ?
