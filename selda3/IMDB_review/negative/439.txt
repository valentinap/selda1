i cant believe anyone found this movie even mildly entertaining let alone brilliant even more preposterous are the comparisons to 2001???? like all of nolans other movies interstell im not going to write synopsis or give details but simply share my opinion there was nothing even remotely good about this film it attempted to blend ideas and plots from past scifi films but in the end turned out to be a disconnected and poorly developed mess everything from the crap science to the uninteresting characterscheesy and awkward dialog to the story or lack thereof made this film unwatchable the characters did not come off like scientists they didnt even come off like people in such dire situations would such as making jokes about being an asshole when confronted by a massive black hole anne hathaways character was particularly inferior i seriously wanted someone to strangle her of course this could have been excused if the movie didnt take itself so serious or had some redeeming qualitiesaspects however the film tries so hard to be profound but it ends up being awkward the end
