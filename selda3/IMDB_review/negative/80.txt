this movie is a darn shame for its poor ability to tell a story and i am a bona fide scifi lover this movie is a pale imitation of 2001 a space odyssey from the 1960s and it will leave people who lack a significant scifi background scratching their heads and asking themselves what did i just see? what did it mean? plot synopsis earth is dying a slow ecological death the dust bowl is back bigger and badder than ever crops are failing one by one all we can grow is corn and you know what happened to ireland when it tried monoculture the potato famine earths only hope is to send expeditions through a black holewormhole thats conveniently appeared near saturn in the movie 2001 the earth was poised on the brink of mutually assured nuclear destruction and a monolith appeared in the orbit of jupiter so we sent a mission to it with a bunch of hibernating astronauts and an insane homicidal computer in interstellar the missions hope is to find a habitable planet at the other end of the wormhole to achieve this mission a nasa gone underground sends the wobbliest spindliest ship you might imagine with a bunch of hibernating astronauts and a very personable security robot the space vehicle thats sent looks like it could easily be crushed in the tidal gravitational forces of a black hole it takes an additional two hours for the movie to explore what happens on the other side of the black hole the special effects and cgi are probably very good in this movie but seeing it in imax presented two problems first the focus was not very good when projecting the movie that large second its impossible to take in the entire screen you must constantly scan back and forth across the image because the filmmakers emphasis was sometimes towards the edge of the screen this appears to be a frequent problem with popular releases shown in imax and i keep forgetting about this problem i really wanted to like this film i didnt
