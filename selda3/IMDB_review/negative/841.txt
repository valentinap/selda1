 not being a dork or geek the mystique of these movies are lost on me so here is a review from someone that actually had dates in high school and didnt play d&d every friday night long lame sword fights to win a sword fight with the orcs all you need to so is step aside and cut them across the chest then as an alternate you can spin and run your opponent through i figure me and four other people could effectively wipe out a million of these lame fighters for this reason alone i give the movie a thumbs down the special effects were perhaps the best ive ever seen great monsters and landscapes is it just me or were most of the characters in this story gay just look at the way froddo looks at sam and vice versa pure lust in their eyes then there was this albino vulcan who always made double entandres toward a midget with a big nose he was obviously gay then there was the way gondorf kept touching the hobbits is this guy a priest anyway i give this movie a thumbs down it had the longest ending of any movie ive seen people were saying it it over yet but no it kept on going and going like the energizer easter bunny peter jackson is purely b list in my opinion there thats from a cool guy later
