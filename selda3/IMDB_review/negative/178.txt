take the nonsense of inception multiply by about 1000 add some soap opera moments and you get interstellar i dont have to check the spoiler box because there is nothing to spoil or rather there is everythingto spoil but there isnt time enough to call out the instances of bad dialog poor acting lousy hair jobs words strung together that sound interesting but mean nothing contradictions galore real black holes aka plot holes one liners designed to emotionally hook the audience cause there aint no substance visuals to distract cause there aint no substance deus ex machinas as needed and they are too frequently needed etc and so on oh did i mention bad evil mixing? and for those of you whiners about hate no this isnt about hate its about the lack of sound movie making the only sound movie making principle followed isyou get a hap hap happy hollywood ending in sum a shakespearean epitaph is appropriate full of sound and fury signifying nothing ps i did enjoy the music but my bad couldve gotten that for a lot less investment of time and money
