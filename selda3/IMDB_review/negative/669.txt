 okay i realize that this movie is considered by many to be a great film i understand that they are extremely faithful to the novels and this pleases many fans what i do not understand is how anyone can say this film is better than the godfather ii and even one spot away from the first godfather go take a gander at the imdbs top 250 and youll see that this movie is only marginally below the shawshank redemption i mean cmon someones gotta figure out a way to balance the rating system here all thats going on is these movies cult of scary and weird followers sit in their dank cold basements on the internet and vote these films a 10 when in the grand scheme of things theyre really more of a 6 7 or maybe an 8 im sorry but no matter how great these movies may seem theyre little more than a cgi fest of monsters armies and magical beams this film cant hold a candle to the intense drama of michael corleones criminal empire holding power in 1950s las vegas cmon imdb viewers lets keep the ratings reasonable
