so my review is a bit late however it stands out none the less when i think about it certain parts of the dark knight werent horrid the batmobile was pretty sweet honestly thats all i can think of because the rest was absolute crap where shall i beginahh heath ledger come after me if you will haters but he deserves to pay even when dead his acting while entertaining was not joker joker does everything to engage in a game of chess with batman and always wants to end up the loser he portrayed the joker completely backwards im glad it was his last performance and in a way its irony he failed and the jokers spirit ended his miserable existence this dead horse has been beaten long enough so i wont go too far but batmans voice really shitty movie shittier sequel
