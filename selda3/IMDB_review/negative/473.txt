god this show just doesnt get better when i saw the imdb ratings i thought i should give the show a try i mean it had an 8+ on imdb and i dont typically watch anything below 7 alright so apparently the show must be for someone else than me because after starting to watch it nothing justifies the good scores okay so i kept going hoping that i was missing something  or maybe the good stuff just came later? but im now in the middle of season 3 and i have never wasted as much time as i have watching arrow who wrote *read stole* that plot? its not even stolen very well as it is obviously much much worse than any similar vigilante plots out there and you just after a few shows you will know exactly what will happen next and think to yourself no they wouldnt say that or do this cause that would just be dumb unoriginal and lame and then bum it happens and you get so embarrassed for the director honestly more than half of the episode i had to look away of embarrassment god i really dont understand how this show could get more than 55 at maximum so heres the main points  incredibly bad acting  plot is stolen directly from other novels & movies such as for instance batman  hell even ras al guhl is in it which is a monstrous disgrace  editing mediocre  not even the action scenes are good  no original bad guys either  what does it do good? well i guess i think i saw a lamborghini aventador somewhere in season 2 alright 2 stars  1 for the lambo and the other for the ability to fool such a large audience and somehow make it this far without being a total flop beyond my mind to figure out stay away dont waste your hours this show isnt even good for a rainy day unless youve already watched everything else there is to watch and even then id consider doing something else thats more exciting and less predictable  such as playing chess
