i had to comment i really did all those eulogies on what is in reality a hackneyed complacent pretentious film nothing that this film says challenges any principle or thought its purpose is to confirm every conservative sentimental instinct in us all and yet it has a sense of its own putative profundities and bulldozes these throughout the film really what the film is saying is neither profound nor original and is not to my mind worth saying in the first place at least not at such length ie life is hard people suffer but through struggle the human spirit will win through learn to make friends and get their deserved reward mmm nothing makes any of the characters real and the actors are not helped by this terrible overloaded narration which applies a great weight on the story which cannot breath as every moment is made to seem sooo significant it is not just that there is no lightness of touch in the direction or that there is no humour it is that there is a sense that what is being described is more important than humour or than the real nature of friendship suffice to say i loathe this film and recommend people watch it only as a lesson in what is bad about big budget hollywood movies
