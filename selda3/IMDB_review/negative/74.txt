this movie is not a 1 in reality its more a 56 but i need to make that stupid average rating go down i couldnt understand why this movie has a 90 in imdb but now reading the comments here i finally get it its good advertisement the best advertisement that i have seen in many years this movie will drive you crazy if you know something about astrophysics or normal physic and you have seen enough movies in your life because there are way too many clich_s and too many pseudophysics not fake physics like the disneys films pseudophysics like ancient aliens from history channel ps sorry for my english
