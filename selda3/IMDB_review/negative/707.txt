 one reviewer wrote [my father] spent wwii fighting in the pacific john tolkien had spent wwii warm and cozy in oxford writing drivel um excuse me but you do know that tolkien fought in the first world war indeed it was around that time that he started writing his mythology right i guess not otherwise you wouldnt have written such a silly uninformed comment as for the book being sexist and racist thats purely a matter of interpretation certainly not shared by all the whole complaint about there being no people of color in the lord of the rings is anyway a weak one tolkien created lord of the rings as part of a greater mythology which he intended to be his vision of english myth since nothing substantial was in existence in that regard england is indigenously white as far as i am aware thus all the characters in the silmarillion and lotr are white let me put my point in the form of a question are there white people in african asian or south american myths no there are not thus its unfair to criticize the fact of an all white cast in tolkiens mythology yes i am aware of the easterlings in the book who are described as swarthy and of the fact that they are in league with the dark lord but swarthy does not necessarily mean black and their being both swarthy and bad has more to do with the fact of their geographical occurrence and the fact that they are men it wasnt only the swarthy people who were in cahoots with the dark lord
