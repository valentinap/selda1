i never write reviews about movies but having seen the ratings on this site i have to say something to stop people from being misled about this so called blockbuster the movie is total rubbish and made no sense the acting is dreadful and watching it after an hour made me wish everyone died so i could end my pain 3 hours of my life that i will never get back do not waste your time watching this movie and if you do just remember i warned you first ps i have also noticed that all the 1010 reviews are from many non english speaking countries and just i wonder if they have all been paid to boost the ratings of this publicity driven awful movie stay clear
