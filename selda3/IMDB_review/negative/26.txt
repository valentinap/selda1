went to see this in the cinema after the good reviews from imdb and my friends some of whom went to see it twice what a disappointment it didnt appeal on any level it was a complete pile of groot humour was limited and shallow plot gossamer thin and the action was not really worth the effort on the whole its not as if i took the film seriously either i really enjoyed the ludicrous lucy despite its numerous flaws surely i cant be the only one who didnt like this film? if it had been directed by uwe boll it couldnt have been much worse if i never see it again i will be ok glad i didnt waste more time and money watching it in an imax a 12 inch portable black and white would suffice
