the trailers had me anticipating something like early james bond as a super hero this movie made the characters look like jokes the obviously sped up fight scenes looked stupid and omg samuel jackson looked ridiculous dressed like a skater punk besides the fact that it was totally outside the atmosphere that the movie was supposedly creating it is just sad for samuel jackson i get why the studios might want to hide the fact that he is almost 70 and looks more like 90 these days sean connery had the good sense to age gracefully instead of foolishly and jackson or his handlers should try that other than that what i can tell you about the movie without spoilers is limited  it is an action movie that i suppose is about as good as most in the genre but it could have been more it seemed to be an attempt to create a new mythical hero in the kingsman and i believe that was a failure it was unclear why these people existed as chaos and death seemed even more likely with them than without them kingsman is a poor myth because it does not seem to have any purpose other than its own glorification thats hollywood i guess but i hoped for more
