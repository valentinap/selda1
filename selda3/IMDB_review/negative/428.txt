i dont know why the planet staying near at the black hole would not be absorbed by the black hole and i dont understand why the black hole can flash i means though some energy can escape from the black hole but the visible light does not have the enough energy i guest there are other very obvious mistakes haha it is said that the hero gets in the 5d space let us make an example in 1d world the ant would be blocked by a spot however when the ant get into the 2d world the spot would not be the block anymore which means the block in lower dimension would not be the block anymore in a higher dimension thus if the hero gets in the 4d world i dont think he would be block in the black hole and he gets in the 5d world~~~~ haha
