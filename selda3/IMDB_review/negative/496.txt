despite as far as i recall the first movie being pretty good insurgent just betrays everything that happened at the end with an unsatisfying explanation of why the villain is still in power the movie contains plot twists that a five year old could have predicted and is generally lackluster in its dialog with a weak plot boring characters and a total disregard for all character development from the first movie this was an extreme disappointment for me i will admit there were some good scenes but a diamond smothered in cow manure isnt very attractive the bottom line is that i didnt connect with any of the characters i dont know if this is the case but it seemed like they were trying to fit a lot of things from the book in that didnt belong the plot jumped all over the place without getting to know the characters in the plot or subplots i just got out of the movie and i can only remember three of the characters names
