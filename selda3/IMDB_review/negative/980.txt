this is for all the guys who voted to make this movie a masterpiece i dont know on what everyone depended in evaluating this movie everyone agrees that the cast includes some of the best actors out there but a good cast doesnt mean that the movie is a masterpiece this movie was without a subject no message too much repeated sentences nothing connected with each other you will get tired of listening to duologues about foot massage  hamburgers  butchs fathers watch ду_etc these things cover more than a half of the movies length without meaning anything to the movie i was very disappointed when i saw this movie this movie is way overrated and should be among imbd 100 bottom if you want to waste two and a half hours listening only to duologues without a subject then this is the movie and if you really want to know how a masterpiece looks like then you should watch the shawshank redemption
