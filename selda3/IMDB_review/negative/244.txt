no spoiler needs to be flagged here it was spoiled from the start 165 minutes of nothing a waste of film and 13 years i havent watched a movie boring in years at best patricia arquette was almost ray light however the movie was so bad i even got tired of seeing her if i had rented this movie at redbox for $1 it wouldnt have been worth it cartoons have more depth im not sure how this movie is up for any award unless maybe a golden raspberry since it took 13 years you could give the golden raspberry for lifetime achievement
