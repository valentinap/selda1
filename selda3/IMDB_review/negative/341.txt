i will preface this by saying that i have not read the books i did see the first movie and actually enjoyed it i usually watch movies such as this with a skeptic mind and the first one wasnt bad this movie however was terrible heavy spoilers roasting over an open fire to follow ive heard that the movie deviates almost unforgivably from the book if thats the case i cant speak for the book but the movie script looks to have been written by a highschooler at best the movie is riddled with clich_s main character with a dark inner battle raging due to prior decisions made boring people and armies showing up just at the perfect time forgivable once not around the 5th time bad guys who couldnt hit a target 20 feet in front of them while shooting an automatic weapon man those guys suck and the ultimate faked death with poisonparalysis scene wow that whole scene was bad throughout the whole movie the main character the annoying tomboy girl tris keeps being painted as tough and deadly she is neither of these in fact she is quite laughably the opposite could her personal trainers not put her through some weighttraining classes? her hairstylist was definitely present as her hair looked like she just stepped out of a hollywood salon right after the scene where she cut her own hair with a pair of rusty scissors it looks like she couldnt even do 10 push ups yet she was fighting people and saving people falling over ledges with ease but she looks like a huge wuss her little girly grunts and squeals she made when fighting or doing action made me bust out laughing and the scene where she breaks through the glass is meant to be badass and instead just left me hoping she would bounce off the glass and fall flat on her back man i wanted to laugh so bad and probably the most unforgivable part of this whole movie was how pointless everything was examples they fight the factionless on the train killing several and doing serious damage to many more not really sure how because tris fights like a sissy girl then the main character four says his own name and the leader of the vagabonds through bloodied teeth is like oh we cool bro never mind you just headbutted me in the face and killed my friends the hell?? oh and triss brother is a huge pussy they continue to fight hard and kill people to narrowly escape the perfectly uniformed drone guards of the capital so that they can go in to hiding then the main character just gives herself up i think it was because the villain was threatening to kill innocent people with her mind control devices never seen that before but it doesnt really matter then shes given the chance to escape by her double double crossing friend didnt see that coming and yet she chooses to stay to open the mystery divergent box well what was the point of anything if you wanted to open it anyway?? i was dying to contain my frustration also how does the evil capital lady have this perfectly built divergentboxopening proprietary chamber system complete with bulletproof glass and mysterybox holding pedestal just already set up? does no one question this stuff??? and to top it all off the supersecret mustbepreservedatall costs message in the box the entire point of the movie divergents are cool dont ostracize them oh and the rest of humanity is living outside the wall cheers what? no one has bothered to check this whole time?????? gag enough roasting to conclude lots of movies even good ones have clich_s and information that you are just supposed to assume but this movie was genuinely terrible maybe all the people reviewing this with an 710+ saw a different movie than i did
