i love the lord of the rings all 3 included i love the epic extremely long nature 3 hrs+ each that really allows the viewer to become immersed in the world that being said as much as a movie like braveheart is extremely under rated for its amazing acting directing etc lord of the rings is conversely overrated exhibiting in many instances very poor acting gimli anyone a weak translation of the book the books blow the movie away and truly subpar directing regardless of what the academy or any one of you fools may think lotr could have been a truly epic masterpiece if directed and acted accordingly however it still remains a very entertaining movie even with all of its flaws albeit in ten years it may unfortunately only be remembered as the most overrated movie in history 45 all time are you kidding me that is absolutely rediculous which is really a shame for such an ambitious fun to watch movie
