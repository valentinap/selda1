this movie just sucked it was so damn juvenile that as an adult i felt as board and uninterested as listening to a 10 year old tell me how their day went at elementary school theres a main underlying premise but not much happens between the beginning of the movie and the end and the damn thing is about 2 hours long chris pratts character was a ripoff han solo but extremely laidback to the point of being annoying and too hip with a douche brosurfer attitude zoe saldanas character was uninteresting and relatively weak in the story when she could have had a bigger part and that damn raccoon voiced by bradley cooper was more annoying than jar jar binks in star wars this movie rips off star wars in many way down to the retrolike scifi look of the movie half and i mean it seemed like halfit was that boring the movie took place in a prison and nothing really happened besides their dumb escapetrust me it was stupid how they escaped this movie is like watching an incoherent childs illogical dream it is an orgy of impossible childlike fantasy there is nothing in it that made sense and there is nothing that engaged the viewer the antagonist is invincible but wait no hes notthe protagonist is a fragile human but wait no hes notits probably one of the most poorly written comic book adaptations in cinema history hell or its probably one of the best marvel comic books are pathetically stupid anyway i hate this movie with a passion and i so regret seeing it do yourself a favor and skip this boring extremely poorly written film
