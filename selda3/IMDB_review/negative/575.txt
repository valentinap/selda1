first the good stuff the acting was superb edward norton was very strong though i expected more somehow and brad pitt was a phenomenon im glad sean penn pulled out of this role though im sure he would have nailed it as well and in a very different way ill bet the direction was also interesting though it seemed like the director was enjoying himself to much so much of it seemed like the wouldnt it be cool if style of direction now the bad stuff this plot is more full of holes than independence day i mean it makes absolutely no sense whatsoever other reviewers have said that if you go to this movie you must be prepared to think very true you must think about the films themes and the films subtext every step of the way this was extremely interesting and enjoyable but whatever you do please do not think about the plot it doesnt hold up under any scrutiny at all at a very basic level this film doesnt make sense i cant elaborate without throwing out a huge spoiler so i wont if you ask me plot is the first thing if you have a weak plot that can be forgiven by other strengths but if your plot cant even stand up without the willful indulgence of a forgiving audience then youve already fouled up too big to ignore this movie could not have been good without massive script alterations no matter how good the acting how good the directing how clever the dialogue this movie could not have been other than a travesty of modern film horrible on the other hand from the number of posters here who seem to think that edward nortons character was named jack its quite clear that people indeed dont pay very close attention to films no wonder this film is so highly regarded
