guardians of the galaxy has a great 70s soundtrack which is recommended to be listened to on your walkman while on your own adventures rather than as the score to this latest piece of hollywood marvel trash but that doesnt make up for a crap film with a pathetic childish storyline bs joke acting and zero suspense worse than that  it wasted karen gillan who is one of the hottest scifi girls on the planet and can act a whole better than the dumb talentless yanks she has the misfortune to share her pathetic amount of screen time with besides karen who is always fun the only character in this piece of juvenile junk with any charisma is a wooden tree voiced by vin diesel the rest is a total garbage film for the under 5s or idiots to enjoy
