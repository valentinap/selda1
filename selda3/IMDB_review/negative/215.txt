please do not waste your time or money on this nonsense oh boy where do i start ok for me the worst thing is when she gets back and tells everyone that neil patrick harris kidnapped her rosamund he did this by bludgeoning her and she lost a large amount of blood which he cleaned up then he takes her diary to her husbands fathers house to burn how does he even know of this location?????? but he makes such a p$$ poor attempt to burn it which would take 5 min to do properly as opposed to the 30+ to clean the blood and no one questions this even once no one even looks for any wounds or asks about her wellbeing and she is not treated for any wounds oh and the hospital sends her home covered i mean a copious amount blood no flipping way the hospital would clean her looking for wounds especially with this much bloodi could go on and on but just read the other truthful reviews they will point out most of the other glaring mistakes and downright intelligence insulting nonsense i really wish imdb would have a 0 or negative review number as this does not even rank a 1 i give this 5 for utter bull$h1*
