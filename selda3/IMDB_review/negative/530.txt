an 84 are you high? i always thought that there would be a good reason for a movie to last 2 and a half hours i dont see why so many girls my age 16 were so into it after watching gone girl i felt as if i had wasted so much time in which i couldve accomplished something and made myself more useful this movie was a waste of time it was boring long and totally ridiculous i dont see what is feminine about it since there are some totally disgusting scenes that i think some men couldnt bare to watch which of course had nothing to do with the plot fake rape was there really a need for it? was there a need in using seduction to kill your ex? couldnt you just kill him in his sleep? but no i had to be done in a sexual way to make to movie stand out more the sex scenes were totally outrageous disturbing and completely unrealistic and next time you make a movie try and reduce the amount of oral sex no one wants to see someone implying that are having oral sex i dont know what else to say but this movie is just really bad and it annoyed me because i was spending so much time desperate to see it because of the high rating and when i did i felt like i wasted so much time obsessing over nothing they couldve chosen better actors and actresses too i hope i never come across a movie that was this bad every again sorry but this movie was an epic fail
