i was very much disappointed by this flat action movie and its predictable ending i am a fan of the old missionimpossible series of the 60s and 80s and therefore i think the plot is ridiculous at best why should jim phelps do what he did? he was always loyal through the many episodes of the series and there he could have gotten much more money if he had betrayed his team the reason why peter graves jim phelps did not star in this movie is because he did not agree with what i have just said anyway this movie is not for fans of the series because there is nothing left of the teamwork spirit of the series it is a one man show for tom cruise
