talk about a bad mainstream movie bad acting and terrible choices of scenes to have in the movie by peter jackson its a shame its on the 2th place when great movies like lost in translation is much further down sure the movie contains some really great effects and some okay acting but i mean the end oh my god was it really necessary to have 4 ending scenes if you still like these kind of movies why dont you guys go and see star wars at least their acting and characters is a lot more fun and those movies are also contains nice scenes relating to the time they were made this shouldnt be seen as an offense to either peter jackson nor tolkien because they are both great but still the movie didnt really work out ickash
