i always liked sifi movies the alien saga 2001 space odyssey gravity and even star wars of course they invite you to dream about extraterrestrial creatures exploration of the cosmos interstellar fights and what might be like living beyond the earth well interstellar falls very short at that why? simply because it goes well beyond what it is possible and lets keep it clear i am stating that in a bad sense after nasas orion struggles on building a shuttle to send humans to asteroids and even mars for the sake of what? interstellar illustrates us how to even get into black holes scape out of them and see your own daughter dying while you still have more energy and time to keep procreating what is next? it is a shame that a gang can keep you nearly three hours while getting your money to brief you about real science and the new fifth dimension with which that you can communicate through the 3d space and time bad bad and bad
