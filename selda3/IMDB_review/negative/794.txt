 i think the hype around this movie makes people completely overrate it ok heath does a great job at the joker but the movie itself has many flaws 1 the balance between good and badguy is all out of sync batman fades into the background he also has way less dialog than the joker this makes the movie unbalanced i think they re cut the movie after heaths death to put him in the foreground 2 the movie is tooooo long this story can be shorter with less redundant scenes its like they couldnt choose what to put in so they just put all of it in this gave me and some of my friends several yawn moments near the end 3 gotham city looks like a normal city in batman begins it had a real comic feel but in this movie it doesnt which is a shame really 4 the point of the movie i wont tell u what it is but yes this action movie tries to make a philosophical point of course this can be great but in this movie it gets chewed over and over and over and then it gets forced down your throat 5 lack of humor an occasional sharp or funny dialog would have been great however the dialogs arnt very good and theyre never funny 6 the plot devices are really quite lame i wont go into details but most of the plot devices are silly and inspirationless even the comic manages to feel more realistic than that somehow the movie doesnt manage to convince the audience of its own logic probably cause there is none all in all its a fun movie with great performance by heath as the joker however it is not the masterpiece people try to turn it into it doesnt deserve a place in the top 250 and it is not the best movie of 2008 of course if you settle for mediocrity this is the movie for you
