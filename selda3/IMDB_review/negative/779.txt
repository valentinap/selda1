i personally find this film to be a milepost on the decline of american society this is a film in which paid murderers are our heros who endear themselves to us with witty banter between their bloody exploits it features such entrancing scenes as countless murders s&m rape drug overdose and other fun things to watch its a wonder six flags hasnt opened a thrill ride to capture the whole experience it features all manner of completely unredemptive characters doing cruel inhuman or brutal things to each other is this entertainment the last straw for me was when a young man was accidentally shot dead by our irascible heroes the big problem posed by this is how will we clean out the car what can you say about someone who views human life so cheaply hit men or no what can you say about someone who finds such spectacle to be entertainment the characters here are completely dehumanized uncaring about the horrors they inflict on one another and ironically much of the audience must be equally dehumanized to accept these characters as the good guys if tarantino is the genius this film led people to believe that would have to be his point wouldnt it that to enjoy this movie you would have to be in some way sick
