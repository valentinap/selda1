i thought the film was totally awful bad script bad acting bad music and especially bad taste it pretends to mock james bond but with no style whatsoever they are using young people to tell a story that has no moral and is totally unrealistic it seems like a celebration of violence with countless bloody scenes that make you sick they are not offering any interesting points of view but telling a cheap story through violence sexism and clich_s including a blond princess i dont see why anyone would want to watch this film and i dont recommend it to anyone i also feel pretty bad about the cast who have supported such a bad film even worst on them they should have never accepted this film
