i have never wrote a review in my life ever but i feel compelled to do so for this film im utterly shocked just shocked this movie has an 84 rating what on earth are people thinking? seriously? i could go on and on about how the plot is a complete joke but ill just point out the most obvious of all that totally shatters any believably that this film ever had okay amy said desi came to her house and kidnapped her that morning huh? she had no clue what he was really doing that morning none what if he had a meeting with ten other people that could account for him not being at her house? what if he was having breakfast with someone that morning? ok next now how about the diary? so did desi kidnap her then grab the diary and bring it to a house he had no clue even existed and burn only about 20% of it? next when she pretends to be screaming with blood on her dress against the window so the surveillance cameras would see her seriously? what about all the other footage those cameras captured? for example her and desi sitting together on a couch watching tv oh she deleted that footage? well what the hell is her explanation for all the footage being erased except the 20 seconds of her screaming this is not me nitpicking the film and looking super hard to try and find problems i get it a lot of movies have plot holes here and there and im okay with that but people these are huuuuge holes in the story plot holes are in tons of movies all the time but not usually a major motion picture with a major director and a major movie star and please dont tell me shes nuts and thats why she didnt cover her tracks worth a damn i am talking about the fact that she gets away with it to all the law enforcement this belongs on lifetime those movies you can just shrug off what baffles me and actually really upsets me is the fact it has a rating of 84 so please people help me understand this what on earth gives this such a high rating? what were people thinking? what?
