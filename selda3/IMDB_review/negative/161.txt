the good reviews of interstellar on imdb are proof to me that movie studios pay people to post positive reviews of movies the current imdb rating is 91no way in hell is that an accurate rating this movie is awfulperiod how could any professional actor read the script for this movie and not be able to tell that it will be a terrible movie? i really would like to say something positive about the film since it has many of my favorite actors in it the actor list reads like a whos who of movie stars but i cannot think of one single positive thing to say about it trust me dont waste 3hours of your life on this film you will regret it just like i do
