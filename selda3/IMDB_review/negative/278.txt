just like the hobbit movies in which there is 0 real danger for the heroes guardians spends 98% of the time trying to convince you that the guardians are in danger there is no realism no heart to this movie the special ed character i am groot i find to be disturbingkinda like the guy in the ron burgundy movie is he there for laughs? is he there to show that the mentally disabled are just like normal people? conveniently there is no light in a scene so groot just grows pretty glowing light skin flakes from his arm you know for the adult children idiots who liked this film pretty colors tough girl sexy princess check animal character with bad attitude check egotistical smuggler check smugglers friend who turns on him check all powerful bad guy who is betrayed by the next worse bad guy check this movie is a complete rip off of star wars easy escape from detention area check incompetent prison guards check turning off power to escape check i just wanted to puke the action and dialogue belong in a childrens book why does the bad guy hate people? just cause? why does the bad guy suicide his ships instead of use them to shoot down the other planes? why does the bad guy throw people around instead of just killing them because this is a pathetic formula movie with no respect for real adults
