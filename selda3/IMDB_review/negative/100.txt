this is by far the worst movie of 2014 character development doesnt exists in this movie nor any interesting dialogs or any real suspense moments the plot is dragging way too long and doesnt reach any climax if the film would have been 90 minutes long instead of 170 it could have been less of a torture the film score is irritating and dull which suits the banal script just fine i dont remember when was the last time i left the theater so angry and bored before watching this movie just stay away from this banal piece of nothing
