 unfortunately this is my first review here at imdb and it had to be this movie first of all i enjoyed batman franchise and of course start of nolans careerhe promised so much boy was i in a surprise after hearing media bragging the acting of sadly now deceased young ledger i thought ok nolan is back in his saddle where he belongs not only i realized hes not back but that hes discovering new depths of personal and spiritual descension christopher if youre reading this please take time and sit back in your comfy chair turn off the lights and start pondering on your futurethis is the point of no return choose carefully making good films or blah films like this and to people calling this artjust one remarkthe only art involved in this film was pr and nothing else filmmakers stop letting your financiers do the work your film should do by itselfexploiting someones death like that really makes my stomach churn chris come back to basics and satisfy yourself as well as true film lovers forget cashwish you all the luck mate ps dreck knights optimum grade should not be over 6 but i voted it 1 because it seems mucho people need a brain transplant
