if youre looking to waste an evening with overindulgent tripe then this just might be the film for you david fincher has made an entire career out of making films that cater to the lowest common denominator and the basest of instincts and with fight club he outdoes himself whats worse than finchers hamfisted direction is the performance of the nonactors brad pitt and edward norton everything they do tends to either be overthetop bad or so very unforgettable as to almost be nonexistent from uninspiring frame one to the thank god its over final frame this pictures drags itself around on its half baked premise like the last steps of someone on their last breath of life save yourself the time and seek out something far more substantial than this
