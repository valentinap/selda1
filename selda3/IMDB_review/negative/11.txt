when i started to watch the show i really didnt like the regular story from the past insertions but sadly after more and more episodes those became actually far more interesting that the main story then i stopped watching it really felt that i can just watch any episode in any order and i wouldnt even know if i had seen it or not it was all so cookie cutter the main character is not bad but then it goes pretty down from there now i realize that the entire series was written by a bunch of 12 y o during their summer break there can be no other explanation for the mind bogglingly inane plot that tries to carry this series through pap is too good a word for this garbage
