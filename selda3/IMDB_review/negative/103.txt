this is a true zombie fest the undead have made a television show and to underline this i ask the question does anyone ever stay dead on this show? i mean how would we know anyway? i imagine if i was a zombie this would be the show to try out for or perhaps as the show runner or as a writerswooden stumbling desperate i suppose if youre watching this on tv the commercials would come as a relief or perhaps the zombies are holding families of the writers hostage and making them write this show makes sure the most wooden actors possible are cast or the best actors at acting really badly again its on netflix which is usually a pretty good sign that it will be pretty awful
