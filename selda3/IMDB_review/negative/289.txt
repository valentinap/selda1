its outrageously stupid i have read all of the bad reviews currently posted for the kingsman and none of them hit the right mark the movie is violent raunchy campy sexist racist and vulgar and thats all ok but does it have to be so incredibly stupid? honestly does it? and why is the cgi so incredibly terrible last time i checked this is 2015 not 1985 i usually dont care too much for special effects but there is a given level of competence which i expect a film to achieve before it just becomes distracting kingsman has cgi on the level of a cheep syfy channel special feature the acting on the part of the star taron egerton is terrible every time he is on the screen it makes you want to punch him in the face especially every time he opens his mouth same is true about samuel l jackson who played valentine that entire performance felt like samuel l jackson asked him self self how would snl pay this part if they were trying to make fun of me? then he used his fertile imaginations imagined it and played it exactly like that its samuel l jackson acting out a caricature of samuel l jackson playing the role of valentine i think the man seriously is just screwing with us at this point truly a terrible movie not unlike the the league of extraordinary gentlemen only with uk hoodlum playing the main role
