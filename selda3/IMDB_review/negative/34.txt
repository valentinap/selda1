well it is interesting for sure to see reviews for this film at the extreme ends either loving or hating i like to watch movies but i am not like some who seem to be students of film i didnt know going in that interstellar would be nearly three hours or that nolan had directed the film i hated inception also i have a bit of a problem when people always bring up the science in a science fiction film it is in fact fiction however interstellar was just dreadful the first hour they were on a farm in the middle of who knows where nothing was established how long had it been since cooper had flown what was his involvement in his previous career? how did the world get to like it was portrayed in this movie? also i had a problem with the premise that mankind was never meant to stay on earth what? then cooper is asked to fly a mission and doesnt even have time to reacquaint with current technology but he can dock a ship while spinning at over 50 miles an hour hmmm like others said there is no character development so you dont care about these people the dialog also had a lot of problems i was angry when i walked out i couldnt leave early because i was with someone ugh what a waste of time and money
