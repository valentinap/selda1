 i rent the film because the fact that its #9 on imdb 250 list and my friend highly recommend the film so i watched it last night i couldnt believe my eye what a piece of garbage film making this is the whole film is mostly consist of boring & cheesy dialaue in which have at least a million f word in it the character sucked i never felt i care about them and the worst thing is that theres not motherfreaking plot i watched the whole film and did not understand what the hell is going on i cannot think of any positive things about this film and why is this film loved by many and get thumb up from the critics heres some of my theory 1 this is a very unique film for its time so people get on a bandwagon and start praise this film so whoever hate this film would considered uncool 2 pulp fiction is so bad that its good as mention before pulp fiction is a unique film its so unique that its hard to tell that its good or bad but the critics decided to call it good soon a bandwagon start the bottom line is do not watch this film dont care about what other people say if this comment doesnt convince you to stay away from this film then go to page 5678 there are other people who just hate this film as much as i do
