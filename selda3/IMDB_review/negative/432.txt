i didnt always vote on imdb but if my twocents could warn people not to let their hope up on this movie or not waste their time watching at all i would however if you like a lousy crime thriller film wannabe this one is your very choice i am wondering why gone girl is getting a pretty good score here 84 huh? are you kidding me? are people not seeing that noticeably fat plot hole? i had raised my brows at how cops in this movie worked since their first appearance the writer had no knowledge how the system worked but he dare try to write a crime fiction he used many wrong imagination so what we got and paid for is this pieceofs i mean art gone girl tells a story of a manipulative lady who got a bunch of idiots around her so compared to them she was real smart one day she thought shed set her cheating husband up for a murder so she sent him out and drove her evil plan in motion she drew out her blood threw it around the house then cleaned the house not knowing when her husband would come home and discover all of it luckily he didnt come home before she got away for her everything was perfect timing and a piece of cake as the film went on and on everybody believed what she said and ate what she served without any doubts in their mind this sounds very mary sue to me every cops in the writers world worked like an amateur they worked fast too fast but use no brains they didnt work the evidences or traced any phones they used only what she fed them fbi wouldnt do anything about a bloody murder even though the feds had the murderer sitting in front of them soaking in blood confessing and not even feeling freaked out although she told the cops that she had been kidnapped and raped and then the cops let her husband drive her home still soaking in blood when i saw that scene i was going to fall apart thats it thats the whole story tell me she used some kind of dark magic that would be more reasonable than everybody in the world being an idiot and listening to this mary sues words regardless this movie was disappointing
