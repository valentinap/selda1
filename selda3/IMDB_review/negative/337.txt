i would normally not comment on a film that i didnt like because it would be universally panned but when i saw how high the ratings are on imdb i was astonished are there that many people who actually do not believe that men went to the moon or that somehow education for the masses is a bad thing? are there people who think that somehow having more farmers means more food production? if the food supply were to be tittering on depletion it would most likely be because education and scientific research had been discouraged long before there was any food crisis this film begins with the absurd and then proceeds to the unbelievable that down home farmer with the rebellious daughter just happens to be the long lost astronaut who is going to save the world its here that the movie switches from social criticism to fairy tale it is just so disheartening that a film so full of misconceptions and false premises appeals to so many people
