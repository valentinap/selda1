i used to watch the 80s series remake of mission impossible and feel this movie is largely mission impossible in title only its really just a big star vehicle and moneymaking enterprise for tom cruise sure its an entertaining mindless romp that will keep your brain happily in neutral for a few hours and that may be all youre after the revelation of who is the true villain will anger some fans such as myself it really wasnt anything like the 80s mission impossible i remember what about the comraderie between characters? what about the team effort thing? these things are missing because its tom cruise vs the rest of the world the best thing about the film is larry mullen jnr and adam clayton from u2 being on the soundtrack
