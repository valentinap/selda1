i thought it would only be fair giving this 1 star even though its maybe  at best  a 4 because this is definitely not worth 8 guardians of the galaxy was a shot i chose to try in god knows how long since ive been to the cinema this is just another load of hollywood trash i had the impression it was innovative considering the guardians being pulled out from the bottom of the pile and the whole outlaw thing but i was wrong in the beginning whatshisname is on earth and it is apparently 88 the kids mother dies ok is this meant to be emotional despite the fact i have no attachment to any of these characters yet? oh wow its the future now im sorry his mother dies he goes outside and then he gets abducted? what is this supposed to signify? not to mention its obviously unbelievably and strangely timed but this is probably an attempt at giving some depth to the main character but really doesnt do anything for the major plot of the entire film the rest of the film was just a bunch of underdogs coming together because they end up in the same space prison because what happens when youre arrested together is you share a block not to mention gender is no issue here then they fall into this orb situation what is it? it it is this orb and it is powerful a bit like the cube or something there was little development in the story at all really a few changes in direction but no real twists or anything surprising i dont even know i was almost asleep half the time i was constantly checking my watch to see when it was over so we have hideous cgi here ridiculously unprofessional but i guess im not in with the cgi in blockbusters they have this obnoxious claim to fame with technology it seems having the ability to do these things doesnt make it cool it just looks like a video game another thing visually was the designs it was just so typical of the actionscifi genre in the technology and whatnot and the characters very much in the same boat but moreso thrown together effortlessly then after that its all explosions  speeding  advertising  hitting in between theres a conceited amount of one liners that made me cringe the best kind and in the end we have some false suspense because we know everything is going to be okay overall >the comedy was horrid >the story was simple >the characters were lacking in everything really the cinematography didnt even involve cameras >the soundtrack was a bunch of pop classics chucked together so what was good about it? the action1111 wait no >the action was too much unnecessary and clearly there to fill in time main reason i even saw this was i received an invitation from some mates i think ill try go back to sticking to films with a point the only point of this was to brainwash and make big bucks
