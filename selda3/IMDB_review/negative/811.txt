ok first of all i happen to be a real superhero fan hell you should see the space used here to store all my comics so i usually dont have high demands for a superhero movie i like em all at least until i went to see dark knight that is i went expecting a superhero movie instead i got violence violence some more violence and to top it off some violence at some point i actually started to check watch hoping it would be over soon this movie didnt need a batman the way it played it reminded me off those old b movies you know the good guy gets ticked off and goes after the bad guys bad guys are usually crazy pure violent guys and you end up with 90 minutes of killing shooting and so on this is basically how the movie went first you have the joker who wants chaos and destruction thats is the entire story about the joker no debt in the entire character that is his only motivation and you never get to know why so the movie starts with the joker fighting everyone batman the mafia you name it this goes on and on and on when you finally think the movie is over and batman won it starts all over again then they add two face the only believable char in the entire movie but he plays like 5 minutes overall i went in with high hopes after 30 minutes i hoped the story would get started after 90 minutes i was checking watch hoping it would be over soon i think movies like that should have an lbo warning leave brain outside when i noticed the score this movie got i felt actually depressed and i really hope someone boosted this score by cheating the alternative is so horrible i cant even describe it so i keep on trying to convince myself the world is not as bad as that score tells me it is
