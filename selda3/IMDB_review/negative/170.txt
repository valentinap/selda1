the film seemed amazing up until the last 20 minutes of it where logic just blew away and the worst possible ending appeared so let me summarize a handful of terrorists who killed a lot of people wins against a peaceful superb being that tries to heal the world and they dont just destroy it they try to deceive it using the wife who in 1 second decided to betray her husband the deception fails and the final terrorist girl just waves her gun into the air points to another friend who has betrayed will and just commands kill your f___ng self and your wife too just so i wont shoot your friend why will doesnt save his wife while simulating death? even better why cant will neutralize one small stupid terrorist girl? how is it he able to get over every other military unit but not this one? cant he use one of his minions to jump fast and furious? cant he attack her from behind? cant he after all just heal his friend? so one stupid terrorist girl makes the world healing machine commit suicide and basically murder his own wife for whom he was doing this all and who betrayed him in no time and without any doubts terrorists win planet loses basically this film is about that if you believe in something so hard that you will kill many people for it and just demand your enemies to kill themselves youll get what you want its about go terrorists go if you think that you are doing good thing its all good the worst possible ending ever
