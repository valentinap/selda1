 the movie that defines the sensibilities of generation x that is to say its values are worthless the story is lurid and over extended the writer director is overwhelmingly self indulgent and tacky any revelations to do with christianity are twisted by tarantino to fit his obscene sense of morality the violence is absolutely incredulous and the originality to do with non linear plot lines and everything else is greatly exaggerated try watching some early kubrick to get an idea where he ripped it off hell try watching 50 other trashy independent exploitation flicks from the 50s and 60s to see how much originality tarantino has im not going to make any friends here as this film has obviously snowed everyone whos commented on it but who cares despite some extremely intelligent and powerhouse acting from samuel l jackson pulp fiction is a n experience not unlike having your face smashed into a urinal by a criminally insane biker in the bathroom at a race track between race four and five it is an offensive and disturbing trip through the mind of a filmmaker who is as far from being a genius as the earth is from neptune quentin tarantino is not orson welles and pulp fiction is a film which only speaks to a generation pre occupied with body piercing and anti depressants make no mistake i am more of an atheist than a christian but even i am outraged that people find deep meaning in a killer seeing the light and turning over a new leaf by letting the piece of garbage petty crook snake out the door with everyones wallet he has terrorized at gunpoint along with his wigged out nutcase of a girlfriend youd just wish tony minero would ice if he truly was making a spiritual point and sincerely trying to do the right thing hed have given tim roth his wallet told him to leave the bag and apologize to everyone on his way out off to a flawed start as a christian and the fact that tarantino lets us see that roth and plummers characters arent terrible people but just actors before they pull their heist is also a load of crap then theres the completely sickening la underworld psycho scene a personal tarantino fantasy to do with sodomy and a couple of hillbillies which was done much truer and to better effect in boormans deliverance does anyone truly come away finding this scene to be entertaining and if so if youre ever in my town please keep driving quentin tarantino is truly one sick puppy sure he does write some nifty dialogue if you can hear it amid the cacophony of mf and n words but as far as talent for film making goes he hasnt got an idea he couldnt act his way out of a box made of wet tissue paper spielberg gave a better performance in the blues brothers and visually he has nothing to offer at all if anyone knows his influences and he speaks of them often you will know how all of the people he holds dear and in high regard especially howard hawks would phone the swat team on him rather than invite him to sit at their table and to sum up my point what can you expect from a guy who prattles on and on and on about how great a film rio bravo is before any more gen x and yers announce to the world that this is the greatest film ever made please see some other movies beforehand start with citizen kane
