the only thing worth seeing in this movie is the cgi it is beautifully done although i found the 3 fairies quite disturbing looking creatures and thus very unsettling i would give it an 8 for the cgi but the movie well thats quite another story they havent respected the classic the original story if so maleficent would be evil the original is a story of good vs evil right vs might and a lesson that love conquers all but rather than that simple formula this is a story of a jiltedbetrayed lover who seeks revenge through an innocent child to me that is not respecting the original story and it didnt bring us what we love about this story it isnt a different but classic fairy tale the formula for a classic fairy tale is that there are no muddled lines between good and evil this one muddles all the way through i didnt see anything in this movie that was even remotely reminiscent of the original only the names and the spindle it was just a dark and horrible story i wouldnt bring my kids to see it this isnt a lesson of goods triumph over evil this is some sort of warped tale of psychological excuses for bad or deviant behavior instead of teaching children right is right and wrong is wrong it teaches that wrong can be right just so long as the person doing wrong thinks its fair or even worse cant be helped this antihero worship mentality is not what any child needs and is the ruin of our society lets root for the bad guy lets understand the bad guy the bad guy is the hero no one is truly bad everyone who does evil has a backstory that made them that way pity the refuse of society the things they do are either learned or they were born that way but either way they are justified or cant help it we should never blame or judge anyones behavior as truly bad because they must have a reason for being this way that could not be avoided dont blame me others actions made me do it i am right in whatever i do when i feel i have been wronged two wrongs dont make it right it makes it fair everything is excusable so long as i can think of an excuse so first she is right to want revenge and then she was right for trying to undo it and then she was right to defend herself it would seem she is always right regardless because right is perceived and judged against the emotion of the day so long as she felt it was right at the time she was never wrong no matter what she was doing she was always right she was just a victim of some selfish man men are putzes and men are evil show me one decent male role model in this story her companion was a weak tool governed by her his apparent feminine side was his only saving grace the prince was just a pretty face shallow and likely governed by his hormones the king was a user a phony governed by his greed the message here is women dont need men men are motivated and controlled by their lusts and women are motivated by their heart and purest emotions women should be strong and not be fooled by a mans affections when people do bad it must have been for a good reason and really isnt wrong of them bad behavior doesnt warrant our anger or judgement but begs our understanding and compassion any attempt at a classic good vs evil concept only seems to appear in this movie in the vein of women being good and strong vs men being evil and weak to conclude this story somehow meant to convey that love conquers all is a sham this movie is pure feminist and thug raising tripe this movie is unfit for children no beauty appears in this dark tale alas it must have been sleepingi am certain mr walt disney is rolling over in his grave again and again over stuff like this this totally destroyed the disney original it basically told every viewer flat out you were lied to the first story was just a pack of lies your parents told you they have been lying about maleficent for ages poor maleficent evil parents what other lies have your parents told you? santa? the easter bunny? how dare they make you believe in fictitious characters and happily ever afters they dont exist bad is good and good is bad and everything your parents try to tell you is a lie mr disney would have never done that and certainly never would have approved fantasies hopes dreams imaginations and the innocence of children was to be protected and encouraged at all costs
