someone who claims to have enjoyed this mess might like to attempt a brief summary of the plot not omitting as the film did why these boring people were doing what they were possibly the only really effective scene is simply lifted from jules dassins `topkapi but the actor holding the rope in this version is nowhere near as interesting as peter ustinov in the original perhaps the silliest effect in motion picture history  the entire traininthechunnel sequence is completely incredible  occurs where the cruse character throws himself back on the tgv using the explosion of the helicopter see fellows the human cannonball at the circus is faked human bodies are destroyed not harmlessly transported by explosions mmle beart however is worth remembering
