it is incomprehensible to me that i watched the same movie that the majority of reviewers of this movie on imdb seemed to perhaps i was unknowingly sucked into a blackhole wormhole or plot hole that most of the other reviewers of this movie managed to avoid all i know is that my hardearned money was sucked into this monstrosity along with me and for that i am truly regretful like a few other commenters i had absolutely no feelings or connection with any of the characters even hoping at times that they would all fail in their meaningless endeavors a ridiculous premise with outlandish and unscientific bases very little of this movie makes any sense at all it amazes me that nolan was able to draw the acting talent to this waste of time as their considerable skills are completely wasted on this drivel i should note that on several occasions i actually couldnt help but laugh out loud at the absurdity and that fact was truly telling for me mr nolan et al  you owe me two hours and fortynine minutes of my life back
