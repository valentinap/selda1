 i cant see what people see in this movie i did not like it because it is violent for violences sake and unless you think that is funny it is not interesting another movie from quentin tarantino that is just crude pulp says it all the writing is clever i wont deny that the cast is good what a waste of talent to put a movie like this on a pedestal is a sad commentary on our times it is hard to identify most of the characters unless you are a criminal type it seams in order to make a great movie all you have to do is put as much violence sex and the f word as you can and people will laud you there is no redeeming value in this movie
