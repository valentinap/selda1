sucked in by the tremendous hype surrounding this movie i went with eager anticipation as i waited and waited for something to happen in this long winded spectacle of gore i found myself laughing only to break the tension i was ashamed for finding humor in the most inappropriate moments of this film over indulgent pop icon quentin tarantino should head back to the video store so as not to inflict this kind of mess on innocent filmgoers again
