interstellar was yet another over hyped hollywoodized movie 1010 visuals and an ost that sucks you in but the rest was pseudo intellectual bullshit designed to seem deep if youre on drugs or unversed in the sciences of what it actually talks about those with knowledge in string theory other dimensions or who have an intelligence even slightly above average who dont get trapped by hollywood and consumerism would likely agree it sucks i can in all ernest rate that movie a 310 with only the last 20 minutes of that 3 hour movie being evenly slightly worth watching it would get a 110 if the visuals werent incredible and the acting decent the supposed relationships between characters were awful it was slow paced while simultaneously rushing the only 20 minutes that were slightly interesting despite being pseudo intellectual and was all way to predictable minus the attempt to be deep in the last 20 minutes by trying to connect a 5th dimension to the story line and his daughters ghost in her room which was foreseeable the first second he saw her through the bookshelf weirdness that was a waste of time i want my 15$ back
