i hated every single second of this miserable movie its boring unfunny and totally depressing everytime norton does his voiceover i wanted to cry he has the dullest voice in the history of film norton is so over rated i dont know why he is seen as a good actor i am a fan of pitt but he is totally wasted and i came to realise this is sadly nortons film not pitts if you want to to be bored and depressed for a few hours feel free to watch this trash
