honesly couldnt see what all the fuss is about i felt this film lacked the very basics which make a good film good actors boring story and even worse directing perhaps this is because i only watched the movie for the first time recently and therefore am comparing it to the standard set by todays writers producers and directors i dont doubt it was a masterful production in its day but honestly the bar set by current movie makers really sees the god father sorely outclassed it is my conjecture that those who voted 9 and 10 out of ten did so because they remember how good it was in its hay day instead of comparing it to all movies past and present before rating it
