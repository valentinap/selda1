the writing for this series is beyond simplistic and is heavy handed which coincidentally aligns perfectly with the amateurish direction and phenomenally bad acting david ramsey puts in the best performances which should speak volumes about the stink quality of the other actors the cgi quality is laughable video games have better effects for petes sake the editing of the fight sequences at times look as if a live actor is fighting a blue screen and the foes are edited in later and rather poorly at that then it looks as if frames are removed to make the action appear faster the result is the arrow is fighting a bit out of phase with the other combatants and the action looks choppy as well two episodes in and i cant imagine this hopeless dreck surviving a complete season even on a twobit channel like the cw
