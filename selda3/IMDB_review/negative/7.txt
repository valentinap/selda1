why do we watch movies instead of living our dull boring lives? it is to give us momentary entertainment and allow us to dream of what we could accomplish if we are in the right circumstances and try hard enough boyhood is the gateway into the life of an average american boy showing us absolutely nothing basically the only good comment this movie receives is that it is similar to real life and gives you the chance to watch the actors grow throughout the movie that is it this movie attempts to do something risky that does not guarantee success but after all you cannot have a movie simply based on you know how everyones always saying seize the moment? i dont know im kind of thinking its the other way around you know like the moment seizes us for a movie to be successful you need a plot which the movie does not have good acting which only the father provides and originality not the portrayal of an average kid with a shitty life and no skills at all the only good thing you can see from this movie is the actors growing up and for that you might as well see harry potter and so it is with the utmost sincerity that i recommend you watch all 8 harry potter films and receive the entertainment you deserve
