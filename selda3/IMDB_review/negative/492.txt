does highly paid cast means good movie? the high rating of this movie represents the biased minds of reviewers towards famous cast it certainly does not deserve 72 rating twilight series which i really hated was better than this this movie is a piece of epic failure and is undoubtedly one of worst movies of this years to date there was no such thing even close to what we call good acting the movie was unable to develop any interest during whole of its running time i kept guessing there might be some twist or action coming up because of the high ratings but i was left with an anger that i wasted my time it is clear to me now that angelina jolie lacks voice talent she does not have any face expressions and most of her movies are overrated 2 stars for a slightly better graphics movie lovers avoid it not recommended to anybody
