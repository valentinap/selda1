the trailer looked incredibly stupid but i went anyway for the positive reviews for the duration i couldnt shake the fact that everything i was seeing i had already seen many times before and that this film had nothing new to offer gotg lacks an ounce of anything it can call its own and so succeeds almost purely on sentimentality for the 80s from which it took most of the scenes mid showing i walked out to make a phone call i almost walked back in to finish the film but decided that nothing in the second half could justify the lack of story character wit or creativity that the first half utterly lacked fortunately i saw it alone so i didnt have to deal with the social pressure to stay if you see this then i would recommend the early matin_e discount
