clever slick and all steedshinybut this film poached from kill bill the saint inception the avengers any 60s bond etcwith added clockwork orange violence simply shows that matthew vaughn is just another vile tarantino wannabee handed a big budget and excessively indulgently produced a stupid film with set pieces of boring ugly violence some scenes as in the church are just disgusting and from that point the interest level wanes the scenes in the mountain lair are inception meets on her majestys secret service with absurd and endless killing which ultimately made me feel ill 30 minutes too long and from a clown copycat director this film is great initially for 60 minutes and then irritating and vile for 70 minutes yes the damn thing runs 130 minutes i really did feel sick and exhausted when it finished i thought it all a shocking waste of production money time and the studios trust to show contempt for the audience with such cretinous perverse action and result the villain even spews on the audience then there is the hilarious anal sex joke the last 70 minutes of this chrome dildo of a movie are truly horrible
