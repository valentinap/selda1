i just finished watching this movie and have to say what the heck is wrong with hollywood? do they not have writers that any frigging common sense how hard is it to make a movie that is logical engaging and doesnt insult your intelligence you could try and suspend rational thought and just try to watch it for entertainment but thats impossible to do in this movie because there is no suspense no serious action frankly its pretty boring the premise completely defies logic first there is no way the government would not have been all over the notsosecret unguarded facility really depp was supposed to be a super intelligence why would he set up in an unguarded section in the us? depp is supposed to be in the internet with access to any file but he couldnt find out about the governmentterrorist plot? the script screws itself up depp rewrote his code so it was totally unbelievable that a virus could have been created in a few minutes stupid the whole premise of the movie was stupid technology is bad and any advancements must be destroyed this concept was so stupid depp  s character was curing people the environment there was nothing evil about what he was doing the writing was terrible the reason the terrorists wanted to destroy depp  s creation is stupid it makes no sense there was no build up of depp  s character going from good to evil the lawn mower man did a way better job of showing how the characters went from nice to homicidal maniac it was just plain stupid to set the premise that depp had become the smartest super computer but he acted like he had the iq of a 2 year old dont waste your time on this unintelligent movie
