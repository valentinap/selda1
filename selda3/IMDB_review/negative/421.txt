i found this movie to be overly long full of itself endlessly oppressive virtually humorless and overall not worth your time thats my summary but in order to add imdbs required 10 lines on the plus side it was well made so it does draw you in but the long scenes in space juxtaposed with the ugly scenes on earth were just too much for me to watch i eventually sat with my eyes closed so as not to continue to be bombarded by those scenes i didnt want to leave as i had gone with others and eventually covered my ears for the same reason the scenes may be beautifully shot but they are in the end very slow and boring this film should have been half the length and have added twice as much lightness
