this was the dullest film of the 65 films i have seen all year it took an age to get going after 90 minutes many people in the theater simply got up and walked out the rest were asleep i personally demanded and got my money back if people develop dvt through sitting through this then peter jackson should watch out what happened in the gollum effects department between two towers and this entry for the first few minutes that he appeared he looked like he was made of clay or silly putty dreadful effects i also find the actors in these lord of the rings movies to be totally unengaging and uncharismatic in the end i was willing frodo to die because i got fed up of his constant whining peter jackson made a big mistake dropping christopher lee from these films as he was the only one to bring any level of class to them and was sorely missed lord of the rings will never be remembered as fondly as the original star wars trilogy simply because it is unremarkable and unmemorable
