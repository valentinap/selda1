to this date if i ask someone to explain me in short what is the premise or to provide really a few short details about the story nobody seems to remember or even explain this movie is so easily absorbed from the memory of everyone once you remove all the stunts and explosions you really have no idea what was the story in the first place? the strength of the mi team is precisely in their team the beautiful synergy of unique talents always contribute in outsmarting their opponents we have such a usable cast from beginning what do we do with them? we kill them all from the beginning why? so that entire script story  for lack of the better word could serve one purpose only  tom cruises ego the second movie is what i consider pornography of such exploitation but lets go back to the first one this is one of those scripts that is precisely tailored to one mans vision everything in this movies serves his own action ambitions that be all fine but it makes me sad that the promise of real mi team was completely destroyed as some have said at previous and im sure will repeat at later date as well  this has absolutely nothing to do with mi series
