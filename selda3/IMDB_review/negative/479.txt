film adaptations of beloved tv shows are a dime a dozen and it is not hard to determine the diamonds the untouchables the fugitive charlies angels from the lumps of coal pretty much everything else given that brian depalma is the guiding force behind the untouchables and the very structure of the tv show mission impossible opens many avenues that one could explore with a large budget a talented cast and the big screen one certainly can be forgiven for keeping an open mind unfortunately the end result is roughly 12 large scale action sequences surrounded by pure tedium there is a lot of blame to go around for the end result which burned up the box office and inspired two sequels so far but rarely if ever gets a mention on anyones lists of favorite summer blockbusters first the storyline and characters are thoroughly uninteresting for some reason known only to the screenwriters the focal character is someone completely new while the jim phelps character who led the tv series is shunted into support the film allows absolutely no time to get a feel for the imf team and how they work as our initial introduction to them is during a mission that turns into a disaster leaving the majority of the team dead due to an obvious traitor naturally the powers that be assume the traitor is the lone survivor tom cruise but we subsequently learn that another team member survived the melee emmanuelle beart so the two go on the run to steal a list of covert agents from the government to draw out a spy kingpin who they hope will force the hand of the traitor and expose himher or some such thing like the tv show there are a few twists and turns doublecrosses and reversals unlike the tv show none of them are particularly surprising or involving the cast looks better on paper than its plays out on screen kristin scottthomas and emilio estevez are in the film for barely more than an eye blink before being dispatched lead cruise is certainly up to the physical challenges of the role but gives us no good reason to root for his character he spends much of the film either blankfaced or glowering beart as his cohort and potential love interest is lovely but listless jon voight takes on the jim phelps role and pretty much contributes the same dull autopilot performance that he has reserved for his roles in popular entertainment for the last 20 years jean reno is wasted as a later addition to cruises team while ving rhames gets fed what few good lines there are and attempts to appear intimidating henry czerny trots out a slightly starchier version of the uptight government official that he played in clear and present danger meanwhile more discerning viewers wait for the fartoobrief appearances of vanessa redgrave who manages without breaking a sweat to make her fellow cast members appear laughable by comparison depalma once known for some incredible set pieces provides the film with stillborn pacing he ratchets up the adrenaline in the final act in and on top of a speeding train but prior to that we get one mildly amusing set piece with cruise attempting a theft while suspended above the floor in a government building unfortunately the scene goes on and on and on and on ultimately losing whatever suspense and originality it may have initially possessed these elements all culminate in a promising concept that misses its potential
