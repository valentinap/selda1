worst movie i have seen in ever and it goes one for over 2 and a half hours? it was awful there were many collective audience groans when i viewed this film and the endinghorrible i could have written a better piece of garbage i was unimpressed with ben afflecks plight but then i was amazed that i was even less interested in the flight of the gone girl and then to my horror i realized we had to suffer thru the whole part at the lake houseugh and then the stupid ending i seriously do not know how this was released in good faith i guess they just needed to try to get some money back for their efforts
