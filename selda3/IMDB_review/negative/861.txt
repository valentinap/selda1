 in one word boring get the comments people make about this movie you have those that say its innovative and controversial others that its violent and refreshing others that say its a rebellious masterpiece yes you can check it out absolutely all comments fall into such kind of comments why i have a theory those guys have never watched a good movie and i mean it violence gosh this movie was only less boring than natural born killers the worst movie ever made dont worry i have a good comment prepared for that crap also there is only one really violent scene in the whole movie when the pervert binds the boxer bruce and the other guy i cant even remember who was and prepares to torture them i cant remember if he actually does torture them but thats absolutely irrelevant the situation the characters are put into is what really matter and bruce choosing the sword when he escapes oh my that was really nice the only good moment in the whole movie wanna see lots of fake blood watch happy tree friends but do you want true violence watch spoorloos paraphrasing it if you think killing is the worst thing somebody can do you havent seen anything yet its absolutely amazing that crimes like rape and kidnapping are considered less severe than a murder in our civilization okay a murder is terrible but nothing compares to the suffering of those that survive not only the victims but also those around them pulp fiction is about terminating people without a good reason nothing more i see no violence in some idiot blowing up a nameless characters head mtvs movie awards parody of the car scene was excellent they really got the idea this movie only shows more fake blood than most hollywoodian movies but whats the point if it created a revolution in cinema it was to make it yuckier i have seen much more blood in hellraiser which by the way has blood and violence all tarantinos movies are too shallow to show true violence too bad imdb doesnt allow voting zero for a movie
