i dont understand why this movie has 85 imdb rating its pretty boring movie acting is pretty lame its not engaging at all basically if you are not under 13 youll start yawning and checking your phone more than the movie i felt like im watching a live play act rather than a movie direction acting and animation felt like it was done by amateurs ive seen better acting in a fan base remake of other movies and better animation in video game trailers there are quite a few scenes where its so dark that you cant make anything out storyline is very short and not enough for a movie in the end it shows that they will be back next time or something i hope they dont as i wont be watching it at least not in the theater anyways waste of time
