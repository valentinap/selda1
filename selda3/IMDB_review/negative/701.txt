how anyone can rate any one of these movies very high is perplexing this is like fodder for the middle american masses lengthy boring scenes of mediocre effects and dumb costumes the monkey suit takes the cake and sums up the whole mess terrible acting wow they found someone who is actually worse than harrison ford lucas using joesph cambell to lend credibility to this crap was a sin i wonder how much money was spent on joe to get him on the sw wagon ok so it is a harmless movie and some people apparently like it but come on better than american beauty or being john malkevich or spirits of the dead or any monty python movie etc etc etc oh well enjoy it
