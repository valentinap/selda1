i went to this movie expecting an incredible masterpiece as advertised on a saturday afternoon there were about 25 people there i was so very disappointed this movie went on and on and on so much so that i continued to look at my watch wondering when this movie would end would it ever end?? and then it kept going while the idea of filming over a 12 year time frame is unique and very clever the film just needs major editing its the story of a boy growing up there was abuse which was painful to watch but basically the film was just too slow paced and boring it goes on for almost 3 hours so take a meal with you if you decide to go despite these alerts it is just slow long and boring i seriously considered just getting up and leaving and asking for my money back i wasnt sure if everyone was in the same pain i was but i also considered standing up and yelling when will this film ever end?
