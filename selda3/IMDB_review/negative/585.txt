i am mad i had wasted 2 hours of my life seeing this garbage because i read all the high ratings from members is everybody crazy to rate this crap over 8 this is about as stupid as 12 monkeys i bet its the same people who liked that movie like this one brad pitt made a great movie  meet joe black he made so many other stupid movies  or inconsequential such as  the mexican hes a handsome man but other than that can never be tom cruise i dont like tom cruise  hes not as nice as brad but he sure is a great actor this movie is all about violence anarchy annihilation why does anybody think blowing up a building beating the crap out of each other committing suicide is worth making a movie about this is very irresponsible of the director as this is what brought us columbine virginia tech and massive killing mayhem on a daily basis how can all this be entertainment i think the people liking this movie must be either juveniles the video game crowds mindless activitywho never pick up a book read the newspaper  be pro family or somewhat low iq to watch this pointless idiotic movie
