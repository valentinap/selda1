science fiction fans dont need everything spelling out for them thats why the narration was removed from blade runner thats why 2001 a space odyssey has no dialogue in its opening and closing twenty minutes thats why r2d2 doesnt speak english and then theres interstellar matthew mcconaughey even takes the time to explain the origin of his daughters name to his daughters face this blunt method of explaining murphys law to the audience is just one example of the unnecessary exposition which interstellars running time is so bloated by it is also the first of many inferior echoes of contact in contact james woods explains occams razor in a similar fashion however it is justified by the court of law context in which the scene takes place more significantly however is the lifting of a major theme from contact in which jodie foster never fully moves on from the loss of her father jessica chastains character here does likewise only without the emotional resonance because she is so bitter that its hard to sympathise with her the other female character in interstellar yeah theres only two also spends all her screen time pining after a man feminists  stay away another silly moment is the shot for shot homage to event horizon yes there really is a direct lift from event horizon this is where one scientist explains to another scientist what a wormhole is which is like a driving instructor explaining to another driving instructor what biting point is it wouldnt happen like ever at least when sam neil gave the low down on wormholes in event horizon he was addressing blue collar workers so it was once again justified by context perhaps the goofiest thing in the whole film is tars a computer with delusions of being the next hal 9000 which is actually nothing more than metallic origami have i mentioned it knows a joke? yeah it has been programmed with one joke and it uses this joke many times the joke is that humour is quantifiable by percentage why watch this when you can watch contact 2001 a space odyssey or silent running? why go for christopher nolans take on dust bowl migration when you can read john steinbecks instead? on a positive note there are some cool graphics to look at you know like the cool graphics in the hobbit or transformers
