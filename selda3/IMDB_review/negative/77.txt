this movie is based on clichs all over i tried really tried to get into it for about 152 hours but it was impossible seriously top 5 worst movies i have ever watched at the beginning you still have hope that the movie could be reasonable good performance of some actors you start getting into the boys life but this hope just fades away as the movie develops as extremely unexciting imagine a boring life of a boy living in the usa translate that into a 3 hour movie but taking away any potential exciting moments the ones with adrenaline interesting intellectual reflections sex etc etc thats what this movie is i am usually not that bold in criticizing movies but this one deserves it sorry but it does even the 10 minutes i watched of sharknado were better at least it was a bit funny
