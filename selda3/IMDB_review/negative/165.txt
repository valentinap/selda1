the first thing you notice is that females are universally portrayed as the source of good and happy and light and the more effeminate the character the better masculine qualities are invariably associated with greed anger pettiness and violence and the more masculine the character the more corrupt reminded me of elfquest there is a tendency in modern entertainment such as broadways wicked to portray evil by men as internally motivated and evil by women as externally provoked its not her fault she did x it was the only option available to her because of what he did its not that she was powerhungry and caused pain to retain her power shes just misunderstood and once we embrace the feminine superiority the world will be a better place retelling the story would be pointless so i wont include any spoilers what matters is the overarching theme this message is wrapped up in a cacophony of sparkle & wideangle camera work but its still a feminist fantasy in which girls are smarter & stronger than boys the feminine is divine and the masculine must be destroyed
