no need for a spoiler here the ending is so bizarre unbelievable and pretentious it is the type of ending a hollywood director on lsd might make that being said nolan does make the 5th dimension a realitystupidity i cant believe the yawning of 10s and 9s i guess you cannot trust the critics or the movie audience anymore if you believe that movies should be believable coherent and enjoyable then you fail the test to see this move period so my advice to you is simple read the book first oh wait there is no book? that is because there isnt a publishing company that would print it let me give you a line from the movie and you tell me if it is worth seeing who are they? i dunno but they are real and wanted us to be here that is because we are they oooookaaay
