i saw all the positive reviews for maleficent so i went to watch it in the cinemas with high hopes i wish i had ignored the reviews maybe i went in with too great an expectation but ive marked and graded 8th grade creative writing papers with more substance and plot when you can call the conflict and resolution as soon as it is being set up you know more thought was put into the cgi than actual story development and the casting oh god the only person who was logically cast was jolie dont even get me started on the child actors there were many times where i turned and looked at everyone else watching to see if they were reacting positively to what was on screen i found a couple breaking out the cards and playing a game of bluff the ending quote and fade to black was met with a what the f was that? by the audience and a bunch of laughing and booing if you require more than pretty colours to entertain you save your money and time for any other film maleficent gets a star for its beautiful cgi work and costume design but falls flat in every other respect
