 its interesting to read statistics such as the word f_ was used 463729 times in this film apparently quentin tarantino needs to know how many quarters to put in his cuss jar movies are made to take the place of storytellers and when we sit adoringly at hollywoods knee we expect something fabulous not everyone can spin a good yarn and now we know that even our most promising film makers regardless of their inauspicious beginnings cannot hold our attention without resorting to gore and gimmickry films like pulp fiction 1994 written and directed by quentin tarantino starring john travolta samuel l jackson bruce willis ving rhames uma thurman and many other big names leave me wondering if prominent producers have just flat lost touch with their audiences parents and grandparents must also consider the larger view if a little pitcher accidentally stumbles into the wrong warren at the neighborhood multiplex his big ears will hear fascinating new words that might cause him to stay for a second listen but by the end of this loud red film hell be ready for the booby hatch i worry when hollywood dumps buckets of blood like this on to the silver screen im always afraid youngsters might see it heck im not sure anyone should see it i am disappointed in myself for falling for the fast talk and slickness ignored the wee small voice again i watched the whole thing and now my only hope for personal redemption is to try to prevent people with taste from having anything to do with this self indulgent free for all if i were catholic id probably have to go to confession just for having sat through this mayhem public forums are an excellent way for us film fans to inform these talented and powerful people that we crave clever stories told in creative ways and that profanity and blood are best served sparingly it is possible that quentin tarantino is a genius my hope is that his future work will be full and inspired and that he will begin to move toward the light pulp fiction is a dazzling display of drugs death and depravity and i advise you to see it at your own risk maureen adele compton post script i cant be the only person who thinks its getting worse theyre using curse words now that even people who do swear wouldnt have dreamed of using in public i will admit saying aitch eeee double toothpicks is cumbersome and probably wouldnt read well having said all that i could probably stand it if they would just stop using one phrase in particular you know the one i mean say it now pay for it later amen
