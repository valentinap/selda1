just seen the film gone girl i really struggled with the book and found it incredulous so never finished it but the film was getting good reviews so i thought id give it a go what a pile of crap two and a half hours of my life wasted the story is just unbelievable neither character makes you like them or hate them they are just bland and well unbelievable by the end i just wanted someone to firebomb the house and kill the pair of them i would have stood up and cheered as it happened it has a really lame ending a waste of my life utter tripe
