this isnt actually a review of this movie but a review of the top 100 movies list here obviously if the majority of users on imdb rate lord of the rings the return of the king as the 4th best movie ever there either arent many users over 14 or the majority of users know very little about good film making im sure i could easily come up with 100 movies that are better than all 3 lord of the rings movies thats really all i wanted to say is that by rating lotr as one of the best movies ever youre proving to the world how useless this site is for knowledgeable critical movie reviews how can one take the ratings on this site seriously after having realized that lotr is the #4 best movie ever according to imdb users
