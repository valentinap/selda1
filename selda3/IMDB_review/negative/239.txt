note if you read my review please vote so that i know if you found my review helpful or not for that matter thanks this movie has johnny depp  this statement alone should suffice but for the sake of humanity i will try to elaborate many years from now if the world is destroyed by nucular holocaust global warning or some such calamity and then an alien ship lands on earth and them aliens get to watch transcendence most probably on bluray with high definition surround sound from the cloud they will regret not reaching the earth earlier they will also have to accept the fact that they could never reach the level of mankind after watching this movie they would laugh if someone told them that marlon brando and lawrence olivier were probably some of the best actors this movie proves that usa movie industry is million miles  no light years  ahead of bollywood movie industry if you just read the end credits you will know that my statement is true never has bollywood been able to have so many americaan names in their credits whereas this movie alone has screens full of bollywood cgi guys if this trend is continued after sometime hollywood will have no technicians to work with and have to give up moviemaking altogether some jealous people have mentioned that this movie is a copy of bicentennial man which is an outright lie transcendence is absolutely fundamentally different from bicentennial man for example the scientist in bicentennial man does not wear glasses also the robot there is not called dr will caster for those others who say that transcendence has borrowed from i robot and twlight zone etc i say only two words cia conspiracy oops i so sound like kevin trudeau i strongly believe that cia used some covert technique such as staring at goats to extract the thoughtwaves of depp as he claimed he has been planning for this movie for the past 10 years and then has given those ideas to bollywood movie makers to diminish american read hollywood achievement even when hollywood makes a movie entitled dances with wolves there is no wolves dancing in the movie and that alone shows how far ahead the tamil film industry in comparison to hollywood is some reviewers have stated that this movie would win all the oscar awards one has also mentioned cannes since movies such as terminator godzilla i robot transformers and others  all of which are made based on concepts stolen from parts of endhiran by a method i mentioned earlier hint cia was involved  have won so many oscar and cannes awards transcendence is bound to surpass them all by winning in all categories at the oscars and cannes negative points the only negative point of this movie is its short length this movie should have been at least 6 hours long for detailed character development and other aspects if simple movies such as once upon a time in america which neither had songs nor cgi could be 4 hours long transcendence the greatest movie ever made surely should have been at least 6 hours long on second thought i also think that the number of songs is too less for such an epic movie with the honorable mr depp sorry if the spellings are wrong note if any of you would like to say something personally to me you may please write to me at pinchashodi at yahoo com thanks
