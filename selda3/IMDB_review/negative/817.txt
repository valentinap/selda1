ok first i am a big fan of batman and especially batman villains to me joker is even bigger than the good guy and i have 5 elements that are the key to a great movie direction story music acting and atmosphere in the movie and the batman saga is all about atmosphere i watch all 6 batman movies tim burton was good joel schumacher had some good moments in the 3 but blow up at 4 batman christopher nolan is bad his batman begins was bad the dark knight isnt badits dead this movie is dead shore its a expensive project but do something with the moneyi dont wanna pay a ticket to see a trailer lasts 25 hoursthe story is the center not the stupid special effectsi love batman and i still believe in hollywoodbut he is bringing me down and down darkvery dark
