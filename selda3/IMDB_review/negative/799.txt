 its an emotional manipulation for dummies type of film with boring direction and cardboard characters nice performances by the actors though some great moments but nothing outside the hallmark meets stephen king meets prison feel of the entire movie i saw it one and a half times and would see it again only if i got paid for the trouble similarly i hated the green mile only later did i find out its the work of darabont my recommendation skip this and go see oz again
