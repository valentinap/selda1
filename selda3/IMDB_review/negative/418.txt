i got something out of this movie i really did it was 35 degrees celsius outside the cinema and all i needed was a three hour nap in cool airconditioning lucky me the latest nolan film just there for the taking it started off as i hoped it would all dusty on the porch of some ranch in the middle of the us otherwise known as nowhere the end of the world syrupy americanstyle little kid tugging at the heart strings  my eyelids already beginning to droop even before coop and his daughter murph wind up at some place that some old cockney and his very jewish daughter inhabit guess it only happens in movies with a blind casting director but that was fine i was almost in rem sleep  not having been able to process a word of dialogue from mcconaughey in over 20 minutes pure bliss and it got even better from an insomniacs point of view thanks to an absurd plot and woefully unimaginative cgi effects my chin was almost on my chest when they landed on the first planet the other side of well lets just call it credulity i dont sleep this well at home wait were going through another kubrickstyle time dimension  didnt we just spend half an hour on this planet reusing some special effects this time made to look like giant waves left over from inception? i think so but time warps so nicely when youre practically snoring i think we lost an astronaut somewhere maybe thats the game whos next? i hope its the astrophysicist who explains wormholes with a moebius strip he forgets to twist either that or it was origami for dummies maybe that *was* the guy we just lost  hard to tell they all act the same flat as the dialogue thanks guys anyway we can only pray it will be hathaway soon shes starting to keep me awake how can a head bob about so much in weightlessness? but im being unfair i think i remember her trying to act some of this script brave move from an oscar winner im starting to want my money back anyway im roused a bit now and thus a bit grumpy were in another galaxys version of antarctica minus the faintest signs of life  this despite because of? the unzipping of a new bad actor fortunately this actor goes even beyond his usual leaden deadness and im soon starting to lose consciousness again and time travel merrily back to the land of nod i think there was a plot twist involved because this astronaut is trying to do a dave and hal routine he must think hes in a good movie poor sod did i mention there must have been yards of inception on the cuttingroom floor last time because im watching more and more outtakes? gotta save a few million here and there i had a dream i dreamed that nolan would come up with a slew of insanely bizarre plot twists right at the end that would explain the entire reason for watching this flick but they carried me out on a stretcher before i found out if it was true apparently i was having a nightmare screaming morse code no no no not morse code thats spielberg at the top of my lungs and disturbing the other patrons naps i was obviously paying too much attention even comatose
