ive felt moved to comment on this movie if only to provide some much needed balance to the string of 10 out of 10s being awarded my real rating would be about 7 10 but i cant stand seeing this up at number 4 on the top 250 list it wouldnt make my top 100 the plot was confusing and ludicrous throughout the moral dilemma of the two ferries at the end really spoilt the movie for me why werent the passengers diving off the boats and swimming for it would both boats especially one full of ex cons really have taken the morally high decision to choose death to save the others some great scenes special effects cinematography lighting dark mood etc brilliant performance by heath ledger but overall the plot let this film down
