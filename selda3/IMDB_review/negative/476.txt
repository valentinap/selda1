firstly i need to say that i have mixed feelings about the director richard linklater and his movies i like his movies but i dont like his style i follow his movies but i dont particularly enjoy his way of storytelling if i consider his filmography briefly i liked his debut before sunrise it was a warm nice romance film even if it didnt meet my expectations fully i met a different film than the film in my mind however i called before sunset a masterpiece it was my movie unfortunately before midnight was a mind numbing experience for me because there was nothing but dialogs no cinema no art no drama we rather listened a story than watching a movie people talk talk and talk but mostly empty conversations not something which pushes audiences to think finally yesterday i saw boyhood and it was not a tiresome journey like before midnight thank goodness but again there was only a story without any background or even subtext if the message was life is empty then i swallow my words but i dont think so the movie consists of the daily routines of a boy and his family but the movie has not any real theme or has not anything to say to us i mean it has not come to any point other than very basic and naive things mr linklater cant catch even remarkable snapshots as he cant create remarkable moments during this almost three hours long movie i appreciate the movie only for its shooting technique which is a milestone for sure and it requires great devotion and great labor in the movie there are ceremonies cerebrations diners etc but there is no depth at all no point and of course no art the boys inner world his feelings his thoughts his soul none of those is showed or reflected by the director which is really pathetic the director never lets us deduce something this is not a growing up story this is not a movie about puberty crisis so what is the point? and the other main problem of the movie is that the boy including his family dont face with a real crisis or trouble or a problem and i know why because the director is too optimistic about life for example the biggest challenge in the boys life is presented as having a falling out with his girlfriend or moving out the boys sister supposedly stands for the flighty girls of today but it goes nowhere we are expected to feel sorry for the family when they have financial difficulty but personally i didnt because in the following scene we watch that the mother gives a splendid thanksgiving dinner to a bunch of people i think mr linklater hasnt seen bicycle thieves yet because otherwise he would have known struggling for life and being a kid in a world full of trouble this should have been a depressing movie in fact commonly it is said that this is a depressing movie but i believe just the opposite i had expected a depressing and realistic movie from boyhood as i had expected a moving and beautiful art film from before midnight or as i had expected seeing hardships of love relationships from before sunrise and dont expect an intense finale i did because life is bittersweet
