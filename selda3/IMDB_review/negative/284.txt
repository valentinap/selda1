just another piece of hollywood trash if youre under the age of 8 or youre an adult male who reads comic books youll probably like this if youre a normal adult youll probably think its the stupidest movie youve ever seen it has all the depth and seriousness of kung fu panda the plot is nothing more than a rickety vehicle for a bunch of adolescent snarky jokes and inane dialogue the plot climax in which the main character challenges the villain to a dance off practically screams at the audience ha ha ha you stupid idiots we already got your money seriously this movie doesnt even need joel tom servo and crow  it mocks itself this movie is really just beyond bad if youve ever wondered what it would be like if a faraway civilizations looked like bad nickelodeon shows or b a hollywood producer let his 12yearold son write a scifi screenplay youll find this intriguing
