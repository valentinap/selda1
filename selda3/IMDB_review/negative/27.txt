well well well was this some kind of amateur demo reel? i claim the very dubious honour of having watched thisermovie twice once with a friend and her kids and again with my 14 year old of course its a stinker but then many movies that managed to attain cult status have been worse stinkers than this one the birdpeople for example one method whereby movies rise to cult level is by negative recommendation people tell friends how bad it is and the friends watch it to see why and ive certainly noticed a whole lot of negative comments regarding this movie for a long time twilight was regaled as the worse series ever made i and many of my acquaintances watched it just to see why it got that reputation twilight now enjoys a modest cult following another contributing factor is unintentional humour my second viewing of this movie had me chuckling at lavagirls shoddy makeover and at some of the tacked in nonsense to show off the 3d effect sharkboy throwing a glass of water toward the audience during his dance routine for example sometimes deviating radically from the norm can project a film into the realm of cult status also this movie while not engaging in major deviation still has enough tedium about it to give it a little push away that direction who knows perhaps in the future droves of teenagers and maybe adults too will throng to theatres late at night 3d glasses in hand garbage that makes this look halfway decentas they do now for the rocky horror picture show right now the future looks grim for this oddity but i would certainly not be surprised to see it pop up out of nowhere sometime down the road
