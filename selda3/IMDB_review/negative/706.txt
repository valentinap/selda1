 first and for most the movie was far too long there was no reason for it to be 3 hours and 21 mins much of the film could have been edited and it would have still had the same effectas for all the people who felt the length was good or wish it had been longer buy the dvd and watch the deleted scenses second to much of the film was way to unrealistic even in a place like middle earth im not going to go into any detail on this because some people may not have seen the film but take note also many of the things which could have made this an exciting film were cut short such as the dealings with the witch king besides some great special effects and nice cinematography the film was a huge disappointment in conclusion i am left with a few question how did so many people trick themselves into liking this moive and how did it get to number 3 on the users choice poll
