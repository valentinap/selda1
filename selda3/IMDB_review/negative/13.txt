when i saw the trailer i didnt think this film would be anything special a few weeks later a friend of mine who shared the same opinion at first told me it was awesome after watching it since then i held my expectations high but i was greatly disappointed to be honest i dont even know where to start the film is a huge clich overall and a ridiculous mess starting with the characters and the actors that give them life we have great names in the industry which of course grants the film some status still my only thought about this was what the hell are you guys doing in this film? seriously? renowned actors mixed with bad acting and pseudofunny acting which doesnt turn out to be funny isnt exactly the perfect recipe i dont dislike zoe saldana but the roles she takes are more or less the same and she doesnt even bother to work on different mannerisms or whatsoever to create an interesting performance to provide her character some individuality most of the plot holes if not all of them are found in the main characters whose ambitions change like the wind and without making any sense one minute gamora was trying to kill peter quill and five minutes later quill was saving her because hes that good just like they are best friends forever after that the love interest feels so so forced because— plot thankfully we dont get to see them kissing or whatever otherwise that would be a bigger face palm the background stories are boring with no consistence and so clich theres nothing new about them in gamoras case we step onto mary sues grounds the usual wannabe badass whos actually just a damaged girl who suffered a lot in the past not to speak about stupid lines which you wouldnt even see in films— oh and of course talking about footloose and a lizard fight to extend the length of the film i couldnt feel any empathy or whatsoever for these characters so that means they are doing it wrong— the sentimental scenes meant nothing and i couldnt care less if they died actually scratch that if they died i could have left the cinema earlier everything is a huge clich frames scenes characters— it almost feels like youre watching a collage and you know exactly whats going to happen every single time this film doesnt surprise you in any way the soundtrack was terribly chosen it gives the impression that they just chose a couple of songs they like and said lets use it even though it doesnt fit moreover and if im right its not supposed to fit its supposed to contrast with the scenes to make it funny it wasnt thats where it gets ridiculous if this film is supposed to be a parody its not funny at all if its supposed to be taken seriously it fails miserably it did manage to make me and my friend laugh in the final scenes at the absurdity of it all not everything is that bad though truth be said the film has excellent special effects and that is the only reason im giving it two stars im pretty sure most people get stunned with the effects and think its great rocket was somehow nice and groot was the one i sympathized more with even though he said the same line over and over for me a film has to tell a story even if doesnt follow convention at the very least it has to express something like every kind of art im tired of going to the cinema and watching the same plot over and over without any consistence of watching films that are 90% explosions cities being destroyed and so on and 10% plot i just felt dumber after watching this its called mass stupidification
