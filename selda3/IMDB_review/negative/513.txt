because of all the positive hype i hoped for at least a good film im left wondering what it is i just dont get so many good reviews? even mark kermode says the young actor in the film has screen presence and i think wtf hes playing a boring so and so  hes not supposed to have presence im not sure if theres enough good stuff here even for 10 minutes  seriously certain things like ethan hawk showing an empty wallet caught my empathy for a moment but not enough to merit sitting through nearly 3 hours of this i just dont understand how it won the golden globe for best film thankfully theres a few negative reviews from likeminded people for me to know ive not gone completely mad
