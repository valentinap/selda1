where to start? this movie is so flawed it is difficult to know which aspect deserves more blame first the music is actually very annoying repetitive and grandiloquent it gets on the nerve of the listener especially after the first two hours second the characters are completely flat and uninteresting their emotions feel mechanical and the bad characters simply act erratically as a function of the need of the story third the dialogs are full of platitudes love cannot be measured says the astrophysicist or outright absurdity gravity can travel through time and become laughable at times the worst is clearly the scenario in addition to marx brothers physics relativistic effects without relativistic velocity 300m high tides on a planet with 20 cm of water goofy space exploration you land first and then you start thinking about what kind of planet it is the plot spirals into such a pile of nonsense that it is difficult not to feel insulted apparently a good physicist was hired to provide the visuals for the black hole it would have been also good to hire a scenarist that can write a story
