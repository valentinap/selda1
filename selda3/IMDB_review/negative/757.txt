 the expectations that were built up by the first film and the second allthough slowed down really plunged down into the lava of mnt doom with this one it really makes you nauseous thinking about everything that is wrong in this film im not talking about the extended version that one is a lot better but still far from perfect and how everything could have been where should i start its overly sentimental i mean really and i like that s usually im a sentimental guy but here its really out of proportion and out of timing oh its really sad when faramir rides to meet the orcs when he has no chance of winning while pippin is singing som silly song like hes castrated and then breaks out and cries just like that bu hu this is a mythological style heroic fantasy tale not titanic everybody are so overly emotional and i dont even wanna talk about sam and his constant speeches about bravery and not giving in with the hand on the chest looking out over the horizon with the orchestra at full volume the only thing missing is the american flag bellowing in slowmotion behind him and frodo and his constant twisting your head like a puppy and looking with big eyes and a oh i love you so much smile at sam every time he saves him or helps him to keep going ok im getting carried away i liked braveheart for example even though it has some major flaws and people think that one is overly sentimental but that one is at least down to earth sentimental rotk is up in the sky almost gone out to space like i thought id never say this but it seems they producers crew and actors really take the film too serious really its a saga not true its a 20th century made up mythology history about an imaginary land its not a record of the holocaust for christs sake i understand how they needed to cut some scenes to save up time but well first of all they didnt succeed enough with that the films are 2 3h long and still it feels youre rushing from one place to the next like youre on a middleearth 8hour safari or cinematic tourbus maybe they shouldve cut it even more so we could at least get the feel of being someplace and not just passing by but whats really unacceptable is when he wastes all that preciously gathered time on exploring uninteresting or unimportant scenes and scenes that dont even belong in the story completely made up scenes for no logical reason the ugly made up bull rhinoceros beasts pulling orc wagons whatta f is up with that i dont even know if george lucas would accept such a badly designed creature in the star wars universe the really awful orc liutenant chief guy whos by the way made up out of thin air who doesnt even look like an orc but more like the aliens from peter jacksons early lowbudget cult films mr jackson this is not the time and place to have cameos or draw funny parallells to your bad taste films thats really bad taste disrespectful to the tolkien fans the m‹Èmaks are really cool but really too big i mean theyre not dinosaurs beasts heyre just big elephants all the small details costumes and armour etc are really beautiful really more than you could ever ask for but the white dwarf miniature esthetics of minas tirith is really bad cause it gives a whole synthetic comic book computer game look to middleearth where are the beautiful classical and authentic designs of edoras and rivendell and no catapult can throw rocks as big as whole houses that too is just corny and childish like in computergames all this and the excessive use and naive belief in cgi technology turns the battle of pelenoor fields which should be the total culmination and action peak of the film into a foney uninteresting starwars warhammer40000 mess its nothing compared to the battle of helms deep and thats not right and this cgi trend seems to be a virus infecting everybody in the film business its really sad these films will be outdated in 10 years but maybe thats a good thing rotk isnt the worst of the three technically but with the expectations you have from the first two the books if you know whats gonna happen the demands should be pretty high and in my opinion too especially after the hint in 2towers that the trilogy was going downhill just like the matrix this is the film that disappoints the most rotk is the greatest and heaviest of the films the first two would completely crumble under its weight if it didnt hold but they could also rise with it if it really grew as strong as it couldve and that is what it should have anything else is unacceptable to me and this is also why i hate it cause it really doesnt live up to its potential it doesnt even outdo the 2towers and it doesnt live up to the old exited expectations you had from the first film i cant understand how a new zeelander who used to make underground films could turn this old british tale into shimmering hollywood cheese its too pretty too pompous and sentimental and all the computer graphics gives it lika a fake sugarcoated shine or crust its like food add too many ingredients and spices and theyll take out each other and the dishll just taste bland its just too much of everything and the whole film falls flat its still stunning but rather tasteless and the only profound experience you might get from it comes soely from the overwhelming magnitude of the whole thing i still wanna congratulate pjackson on successfully bringing this gigantic project home thank him even if hes made me more irritated than delighted cuz im still glad that im able to watch these films he didnt deserve all those oscars but he definitely deserved a few maybe not for directing but for best film for the production but this film should not be ranked as the best fantasy film of all time sebastian
