this is a fantastic movie that truly defines classic cinema how do i even begin to describe the skill with which this movie is made the viewer is taken to a setting of violence in deception set within the scope of 1950s new york city in the beginning of the movie the viewer mistakenly believes they grasp the concept of what it means to hold a position in the mafia but this concept is quickly replaced with an almost uncomfortable sense of familiarity the story is told through the legendary actors portraying some of the most complex and meaningful characters of all time however i gave this movie one starbecause it didnt have to logan
