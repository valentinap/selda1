 im not a fan of this type of movies but since i like al pacino and ive heard so much about this so called legendary godfather i decided to give it a try i must say this is the most inexplicably overrated piece of trash ive ever seen the characters are all ridiculous unsympathetic and under developed the story drags and lacks any real conflict and dynamics‰Û_ but the most disgusting aspect is the movies intent to glorify a bunch of low life criminals and turn them into larger than life figures into some kind of royalty this whole family tradition is just ludicrous were supposed to care about these characters to think that they are cool the major problem here is that theres no real conflict theres no redeeming value whatsoever theyre all despicable and one dimensional so why the hell would i care the violence which is particularly sickening is another issue but i guess audiences have come to appreciate it and its now a hallmark of the genre imagine the godfathers pregnant daughter gets beaten with a belt but guess what shes not likable either shes hysterical obnoxious and even worse she keeps defending her abusive husband in another scene james caan beats the hell out of someone in front of children marvelous thats just great not to mention cool and culturally relevant marlon brando speaking with a husky voice and cotton in his mouth is incredibly ridiculous al pacino as michael corleone suddenly turns from a principled man who doesnt want to have anything to do with murder into a ruthless criminal what this character has no depth no consistency whatsoever his relationships with women are so poorly portrayed they add nothing to his development its pacinos worst i cant imagine why anyone would think this is a great performance if you want to see a good gangster movie go watch donnie brasco instead
