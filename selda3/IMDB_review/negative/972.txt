its hard to find what is wrong with a movie that seems so well crafted and put together well lets start by saying that the dark knight is very boring and messy the plot is incoherent with too many undeveloped subplots the movie tries to be realistic but logic has no place anywhere it tries to be dramatic but the drama is manufactured out of place and doesnt build up from anything lots of poor philosophical monologues going nowhere the characters have nothing nothing interesting about them theyre like puppets used to create some sort of politicised view of the world where everyone is miserable with no sense of humor taking no pleasure from their actions whatever they are and creating this dull vision of the world hidden behind a comic superhero is what this movie is all about all the rest comes as a consequence of this anything that happens has little or no effect batman is just as hollow as every one else you could swap him with some other character and nothing would change action is just average random things happening out of nowhere and no explanations is given on how they managed to do that some great effects here and there dont add much to the movie i like violent movies but the violence in the dk is pretty much senseless as well as censored definitely not for young kids the movie is not dark is hollow if you want a good dark movie then go to see the awesome the crow you want to see a good batman movie then watch the tim burtons version flat with no substance humor or soul the dark knight doesnt leave you with any emotions whatsoever no hope and not even hopelessness only a lame sense of depression
