probably the worst movie i ever seen ive just logged in to imdb to write this review i cant believe that this movie is on the top 250 top 250 of worst movies probably is the right list for this not into fantasy movies in general but there are some limits i didnt realize that there was any plot at all just some random scenes all around a galaxy its really sad that i cant vote 0 out of 10 regarding visual effects the picture was really nice and served in 3d but this was the only plus side of the whole experience boring trying hard to be fun but wasnt really and amuse a popcorn audience well hope we will not have a sequel for this nice wasted 2 hours of a sunday evening hope i will not see another  artwork like this in the near future i cant understand why the expendables are not on top of this movie its a crap title as well that should be popular
