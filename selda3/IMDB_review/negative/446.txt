i bought the studio hype that this was the most intelligent sicfi film since 2001 space odyssey what an insult to kubrick like the dark knight rise interstellar is 3 long hours of torture from the moment mccanaughey accidentally stumbles upon nasas gigantic secret launch operation  just happens to be in a cornfield a few miles from him and they never noticed and by the way as long as youre here could you pilot the mission? we just never had any plans for a pilot until you barged in christ this is a plot device from gilligans island the rest of this turkey might be summed up as weepy soap opera in outer space too many schmaltzy tearjerker scenes for an intelligent sicfi film anne hathaway acts more like a chirpy cheerleader than a seasoned astronaut and like dark knight the plot is so convoluted that i eventually gave up caring the final scenes perhaps somewhat inspired by 2001 are lame and pretentious id rather be waterboarded than suffer through nolans dreck again im giving this 1 star to balance the ludicrous spate of 910 star reviews no wonder american film has gone downhill when the audiences mistake a pretentious poorly written fruit pie for the masterpiece of a genius
