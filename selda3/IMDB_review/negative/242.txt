not sure how this movie has such good reviews it is one of the most boring and dumb movies i have ever seen in my entire life this is 2 12 hours of my life i will never get back do yourself a favor and dont waste your time on this garbage i honestly gave it a shot i watched the thing the whole way though about 14 of the way through the movie i really wanted to turn it off it just didnt keep my interest the ending makes it even worse and just puts the icing on the cake for a terrible freaking movie i am glad i didnt go to see this in the movies because i would have demanded to get my money back i am usually pretty open minded when it comes to movies there have been a few ive seen that are like wow that was terrible this is definitely one of those in my opinion
