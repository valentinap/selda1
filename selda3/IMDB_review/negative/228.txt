okay guys i gave this movie the lowest score possible for good reason so the movie is a revamp of the guardians franchise some horrible american actor plays a human who was abducted and raised by space pirates that teams together with one of the worst female actors to date  her character is essentially a ninja wicked west of the west let not forget to mention the other 3 main characters a tree a raccoon and a meat head who team up to defeat the strongest entity in the universe + a back and forward treasure hunt the acting is crap the story line is so obvious within minutes of starting even the feeble minded could predict the outcome as for the title guardians of the galaxy i would like to comment that while there is a lot of space flight they only save one planet sort of i am so glad i downloaded a cam version of this movie and didnt waste a cent i would like to say a big eff you to whomever picked the cast to this point marvel has had amazing casts iron man thor  captain america? this movie taints marvel in their pursuit of profit they have created another flop do not bother watching this movie
