let me just get this out of the way right off the bat  i hated this movie i think the initial meeting of jack and tyler explain how opinions of this movie are divided  jack says something about single serving friends and tyler disinterestedly dismisses his cleverness unfortunately my friends being clever for clevers sake is not entertaining and it is not art for those of you who loved this movie perhaps identifying yourselves with the main character is not appropriate the point may be that you are just one of the moronic automatons do hyperclever acts of terrorism like a hyperclever movie so the jokes on you you might also note that the project chaos morons are not recruited for their propensity for violence but for their desire to think in complex and sensitive ways much like the fans of this movie i tend to rate a movie on only two criteria was it entertaining and did i care about the characters as both of these answers for fight club are definitely no what am i left with a movie with an unoriginal message revealed in an unintellible way full of commercials starbucks busch beer pepsi to name a few with decent acting yes the pseudointellegentsia are all suckers easy prey to a little pretentiousness they identify with in making this obvious fact a little more obvious the movie was a success maybe the point was to think for yourselves in which case the only natural reaction should be complete loathing for this film
