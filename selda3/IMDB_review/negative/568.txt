ed norton character i dont know im just not content with my life i have a job that doesnt do anything to benefit mankind i have so many possessions but they dont make me happy i just feel there must be more to life than this shallow commercial material world i live in i want to do something different me well its very commendable of you to reevaluate your priorities so since you dont like your material possessions are you going to get rid of all your ikea furniture and move to a smaller apartment one that you actually feel comfortable in norton no me well since your job isnt fulfilling are you going to quit and join the peace corps or get a job as a teacher in an poor neighborhood norton nah me well since youre looking for some higher meaning to life are you going to start going to church norton nope me sigh okay so what are you going to do norton i think ill get together with a bunch of other unfulfilled guys and then well beat the snot out of each other  if that strikes you as profound well then fight club is the movie for you if it sounds ridiculous and it should avoid it like the plague the ironic and amusing thing is most of the fanboys who rave about this movie are geeks who couldnt fight their way out of a paper bag and would run crying to their mommies if someone even looked like he was going to throw a punch at them
