review of one of the most surprising let downs follows there are no spoilers the film spoils itself enough its fair to say that prior to this film coming out i had concerns over the use of the joker in this film concerns that only got more pronounced when id heard they cast health ledger in the role then i saw brokeback mountain and i became convinced that actually the guy had a raw talent and that maybe just maybe he could pull it off until the trailer came out and i was immediately concerned again so how was heath neither good nor bad he was a live wire and gleefully unpredictable and a shambolic almost serpentine presence at points but it wasnt spectacular talks of post humous oscar nods though are an exceptional exaggeration and unfortunately i believe this to be motivated by grief for ledger aaron ekharts not bad but im not really sure anyone knew why he was really there i did not believe in harvey dent maggie gyllenhaal was awful it is a terrifying thing to say that katie holmes was better you actually have your fingers crossed that someone will kill her right from the start morgan freeman has a couple of nice moments but despite being given more screen time he contributes very little same with gary oldman seriously what happened even christian bale seems to have lost a sense of what hes doing batmans voice getting ever closer to sounding like rod stewarts singing voice that at times i couldnt take it seriously assuming you can make out what hes saying at all its difficult to comprehend that the same cast is in this film and batman begins they really dont stack up side by side at all everone feels wasted the dark knight is over long it takes forever to really get any momentum going and then at the point you think its starting it fails to launch there are set pieces that dont really hang together and if you think about any of them for too long which you will as it does tend to drag youll find that they dont all make sense one of the things that made batman begins so strong was a sense of realism even going to great lengths to try to rationalize the ridiculous a man dressed as a bat tragically the dark knight seems to have forgotten this entirely yes the joker is larger than life but does that explain the obviously cgi enhanced stupid moments such as the bat pod cycling up a wall to flip over there are too many of these moments turning every cell phone into a sonar transponder in order to trace the joker um what also everyone felt very written everyones dialogue seemed to be furthering the plot rather than sounding like anything approaching reality michael cain turns into aunt may giving twee and convenient platitudes and nothing else theres no sense of connection between him and anyone else gyllenhaal even managing to leave twee and convenient letters to be read at twee and convenient moments aaron ekhart seems to basically behave like a character bio rather than feeling terribly real and the whole descent into two face thing still doesnt work if you loved batman begins and i did you wont love this im afraid you may not hate it but i dont think youll be impressed i hope to watch this again at some point when the let down has passed me by and ill hopefully enjoy it a bit more there are three recent films ive been to see i had low expectations for iron man the incredible hulk and the dark knight the first two surprised me and exceeded my expectations the latter has left me feeling a bit flat im just very disappointed batman begins set a very high mark the dark knight by comparison is almost worth avoiding
