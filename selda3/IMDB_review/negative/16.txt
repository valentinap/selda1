whats the main difference between divergent and insurgent you ask? with divergent i got to heckle at the screen to my hearts content and shout profanities because i was in the comfort of my own home with insurgent i was bound to socially acceptable behavior since it was a free advance screening in a theater when i say this is a bad series i truly mean that there is nothing worthwhile to be taken away from either movie the 2nd installment continues the overly convoluted and utterly senseless plot that pits our heroine tris shailene woodley against a poorly defined villain and conflict she is even less believable as the brave toughasnails caste member shes been so effortlessly been trying to become and then suddenly she exhibits all the other redeemable qualities that defines her as divergent? and i thought twilight was awful this second installment centers aroundwell nothing in particular it basically picks up where the first one left off and tris and company have to get back at the jeanine  the out of place cartoon villain theres some magical box thats introduced as the macguffin device which ultimately unravels the already fragmented narrative dont worry the sequel adds a whole new level of plotholes to the already ridiculous premise gee all that futuristic tech that wasnt in the first film looks awfully familiar to another teengirlturned heroine young adult series characters? development? dont be preposterous those things dont exist in this movie just like the first film you have painfully delivered dialogue that is more laughable than memorable that forced romance from the first one? yeah youre just supposed to accept it in this one sorry four youre stuck with her for better or for worse honestly the only redeemable part of this hackneyed and clich_d movie is miles tellers character hes seldom on screen and is only funny because he plays a total jerk lets hope no one notices that theyre borrowing a lot of elements from other classic and popular dystopian stories logans run? thats about a marathon right? nope there are no isolated societies in divergentinsurgent hunger games? no this is a movie about an impractical futuristic society that segments parts society for the greater good you must be mistaken oh wait i made it through two and a half pitchers of beer only drinking when there was something generally cringeworthy on screen see if you can beat my record drinking responsibly and in remedy of this movie of course  the best part of the sequel? its 20 minutes shorter than divergent read the full review and others like it on the drivein zeppelin website
