it was awful absolutely pointless without any drama that we can expect from this kind of directors nolan tried to make you excited by visual effect and music but these tricks also doesnt work we can clearly see everything comes from market last year gravity made and worked and matthew mcconaughey comes to media because of one successful series and film and today these two come together for more profit or to just save the humanity  its very funny and this film received high points because it cant even entertain you i think generally saving the world idea like this film is bullshit and wasting the time but i diet think that it can be successful jet in box office like this dont waste your time and dont engage in fake world
