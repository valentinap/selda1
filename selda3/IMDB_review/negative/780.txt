 theres nothing deep or important going on here so a critique of this film is almost unnecessary what passes for quality film making is nothing more than an overproduced loud stunning imax experiment in eye candy that masks once again a slowly moving thin story line obviously the members of sag have dispensed with background checks on film editors theres enough slow motion footage here to circumnavigate the globe twice many people will be amazed by the neverending in your face action sequences but for those who still pine to see the actors perform also youd better search elsewhere its like trying to read the latin version of war and peace while simultaneously being pulverized inside a blender and if having way too many computerized fight scenes forced down your throat wasnt enough just wait the full ninety hours for the saccharine glazed overlit endings and there are at least 5 of them for a while i was expectin obi wan kenobis ghost to show up and smile goodbye and cate blanchett never looked so vapid its brass tacky loud long obvious schlock and thus hugely popular beautiful looking rarely translates to quality in content and this is a prime example giving so many awards to this fillibuster is just a waste of gold plating
