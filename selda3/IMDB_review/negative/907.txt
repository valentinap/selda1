 okay so they built a good villain in the joker but the plot was just a bit too unbelievable to hold together im not going to add any spoilers here but if you want a big budget action adventure escape that totally relies on the rendering farms that had to handle all the special effects and dont mind plot holes the hindenburg could fly through this film is for you imho this film doesnt deserve all the hype look at reviews from people who hated it and see why once the hype has died down and people get over their brainwash to overrate this over produced hollywood crap we should see ratings more in line with the films true value i didnt walk out but that was because i had such high expectations id hope to see this rated a 4 maybe even as high as a 6 by the average public im rating this a 1 to try to offset the obvious shills and excessive hype this is by no means the best film of the summer but in its favor it does give better balance to the darkness of batman if it werent for the growing trend in bucking the old feel good hollywood ending routine if it werent becoming clich‹© to kill off good guys and create characters with seeming hearts of gold who turn half evil id say this film had something unique but that whole scenario is now a formula for making a film armchair critics will say has depth pffff save your time and money and rent an old classic favorite that you somehow never managed to see or go have a picnic with your loved ones the alternative is two and a half hours you wont get back dont waste it to further enrich warner bros
