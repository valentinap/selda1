first this movie is a remake of an old series and secondly it has tom cruise in it tom cruise is not a bad actor it just annoys me that movie is focused completely around him as if he were god no wonder the germans hated this movie anyway i will give away the plot in this movie because i feel that you really dont need to see it the only reason i taped it and watched it was because jean reno was in it and he is quite a good actor tom cruise is ethan hunt the member of the imf team that performs impossible missions during a routine mission everything goes wrong and only hunt and the wife of jim phelps the leader of the team escape the american government believe that hunt is behind it and is a mole selling out to the enemy so order him arrested but he manages to slip through their fingers and even breaks into cia headquarters at langley virginia it ends up that jim phelps is the mole and that jean reno is the agent who is in it for the money the movie ends in a scene in the english channel tunnel where reno flies a helicopter through it and hunt tackles phelps on the back of a train this movie follows the theme of the end of the cold war and thus the intelligence agencies are no longer needed this is not an action packed movie but tries to follow the tenseness of the original series it is more about people trying to get into places which are very difficult to get into it as such it follows the style of sneakers which i believe is a far superior movie
