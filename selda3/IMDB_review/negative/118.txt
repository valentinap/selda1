there is something deeply unsettling about sitting in a movie theater surrounded by people who are laughing as on screen heads are exploding limbs are being hacked off and a princess rewards her rescuer with anal sex the film starts out on a promising and engaging note as we follow the recruitment and training of the protagonist but then at about the midway point things get terribly weird and weirdly terrible this is not just movie violence but violenceporn violence for laughs violence that glories in being shocking and over the top the movie itself in terms of filmcraft is disposable and forgettable but what sticks with me is a nagging feeling that what ive just watchedin the guise of a movie purportedly about a refined british spy agencyis a marker of the decline of western civilization kingsman is the roman circus for the 21st century and every bit as brutal and pointless
