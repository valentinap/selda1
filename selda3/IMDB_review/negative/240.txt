not worth a visit to the theater totally clumsy and amateurish ignorant of the most basic cinematography completely out of pace absolutely no sense of time rendering the plot is so unstructured that its just a mess eg we are introduced to the prince then he disappears then he reappears and thats it so lifeless that editing seems like the land of lost opportunities there no actual interplay between scenes they just follow one another in mere succession no character development for example you get no sensible feel of who the three fairies are and why they behave like they do a repetitiveness of emotions the scenes with maleficent and the beauty are the same and the same and the same no escalation nowhere throughout youd expect the scene where maleficent becomes who she is to be a tower of power but no they could not even get a single scene right the final battle is so out of rhythm that its just a bore instead of having your beat rising the storyline is just a plain line to sum up it feels like a high school production of a play written by children in all this mess angelina could be nothing but flat as if steppedover by an elephant just a long puzzled snore shame cause it really could be an awesome movie but thats what you get when you hire a guy robert stromberg who has never directed before  for your 200000000 movie and they say hollywood is conservative and unadventurous i m pretty sure that the 75 is not untouched after all it cost 200000000 and they have to make sure they get their money back i m also sure that after it runs its course the real rating will be revealed to be much worse
