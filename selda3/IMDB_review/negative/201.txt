rented this movie over the weekend after oscar nominations and reading reviews etc i think the appeal of this movie begins and ends with the fact that linklater made a project of filming his daughteractress for 12 years in what appears to be very self indulgent and opportunistic i cant understand how an actual documentary like hoop dreams gets snubbed not too mention selmas director getting snubbed but this nearly 3 hour marathon receives nothing but accolades from the academy the novelty of watching the family physically grow for 12 years is about as interesting as it sounds you watch them physically grow thats it thats the big wow factor of the film id of preferred to watch grass grow actually the acting and scenes seem forced and i couldnt figure out if he was trying to make us believe this was a documentary? a documentary would have been soooo much more interesting and entertaining mason the sons character never really evolves the clich_ single mom who makes bad choices when it comes to men has been done before keep in mind this is not a documentary this is a moviestory i couldnt help but think to myself while watching this film that i know several families and individuals that have actual interesting and compelling true life stories that make this film look ridiculous i mean mason gets called a slur in a bathroom? oooh masons first alcoholic step dad makes him cut his hair without even asking? a commentary on the banality of life is what this movie amounts to for me? clearly im in the minority as most seemed to have enjoyed the film i dont see the originality excellence in acting directing etc outside of using the same actors for 12 years one of which is the directors daughter
