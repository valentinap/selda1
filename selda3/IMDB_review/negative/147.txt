the movie was too long much to much scientific mumbo jumbo the special effects were a total let down saw it in imax not impressed the story had no speed very draggy performances were ok no oscars here the previews were the best part of the lure the middle was right out of 2001 space odyssey i have never been to a movie where so many people left about 2530 which was most of the crowd my daughter and i stuck it out hoping for some redemption but none came i should have seen it at a bargain matin_e very upset movie goer i know that this movie has gotten great reviews but really  take another look please
