this movie was so boring i literally had to leave the theater before i fell asleep sitting upright i gave interstellar a full hour to get more interesting considering the rave reviews and ratings on this site that prompted me to see it but i couldnt wait any longer the film was scientifically implausible to such an extent that i could not suspend disbelief and enjoy the film at face value the character development was weak the protagonist was arrogant and unlikable and the acting talent of many great actors was utterly wasted on this bomb the dialog was predictable unimaginative and flat while it did not affect the quality of the film i was disappointed that the movie was based on the dangerous delusion that human beings might be able to find a new home in space so people dont have to think too much about taking action on the very real climate change that is destroying planet earth right now but it was the series of stupid moments in the first hour that informed me interstellar was not going to meet my standards for an intelligent film the first stupid moment was during the lifethreatening giant dust storm scene complete with large chunks of flying debris after the family jumps into the truck and races home for shelter the driver inexplicably parks the truck about fifteen yards away from the front door so that they all have to run outside through the dust storm before reaching the house huh? another stupid moment was when the protagonist is asked to pilot a gargantuan stateoftheart space craft apparently built by a few dozen people without any budget less than an hour after he first surprises nasa with his first arrival this pilot has not flown an aircraft for years and there is no way anyone no matter how experienced he once was could fully master the technology of this ship and be prepared for a complex space mission in the extremely short period of time that elapsed evidenced by no change in the age of the pilots children between being asked to captain the ship and actually doing so he almost instantly assumes full command of the ship and the crew and successfully takes the ship into deep outer space on a dangerous mission this sequence of events had no credibility it felt like some adolescent boys fantasy come true the laststraw final stupid moment was when i realized that the female astronaut played by anne hathaway is wearing fresh makeup everyday including false eyelashes not a big deal considering the major problems with this film but it nevertheless annoyed me what competent astronaut is going to waste time and energy applying false eyelashes in outer space during a serious space mission? how would several years worth of cosmetics along with false eyelashes even get approved as cargo given the severe space limitations of a spaceship? how are we supposed to find this astronaut credible? thats when i realized it really was time to abandon the film i was getting downright irritable
