his 4th dud in a row a ridiculous plot for some reason the earth is reduced to only producing corn so no animals birds or fish even though the scene by a lake the water looked clean and refreshing seems like humanity have forgotten that we can grow things in greenhouses and even underground never mind lets move on once again nolans characters all scientists and supposedly super intelligent do the most stupid things anne hathaway goes in the water to retrieve a large piece of debris when a large wave appears she has on hand a robot who could lift this wreckage with one hand but does not instruct him to do so the beardy scientist is by the spacecraft door urging her to get a move on the wave gets nearer the robot goes and carries her to the shuttle the beardy scientist all this while stays put just outside the door and lets the wave carry him away just one example of quite fewthe biggest plot hole is this for some reason once cooper is past the black hole and in 5 dimensional space he becomes super intelligient because he now knows how to solve the problem of gravity and save mankind how he knows this we do not know given that he is just an engineer to be able to figure out something the greatest physicists of the last hundred years cannot is unbelievable he then sends probably the most complicated and long equation in history to his daughter in basic morse code anyone familiar with morse code will tell you that this would take forever now to the film making others have mentioned its look  well to me it looked shabby endless shots of aircraft wings no vistas no shots of the galaxy or stars during both the wormhole sequence and the black hole sequence he stays on the actors in close in fact thank god i did not see this in imax would have been a complete waste of time and now the noise with hans zimmers worst and most bombastic score  added onto very loud sound effects with the actors shouting to be heard we came a away with very bad headaches the end did not make any sense at all but we have the usual nolan fan base that cannot see past their noses all going ape over this and the usual batch of critics with no critical faculties whatsover
