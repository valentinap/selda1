i understand the appeal of superheroaction comic stories the good guys are purely good and noble and selfsacrificing and easy to pick out because theyre really good looking and wed like to think of ourselves as those things or potentially those things if we could just get around to putting down the doritos and remote and having a meaningful job and life the bad guys are just as easy to pick out though many of them are good looking too in this version of the ofttold tale at some point though we grow up and all this comic book ethos is revealed to be a ridiculous and childish take on a complex human world where no one is purely good and few are purely evil but its still appealing to some level of us thats still stuck in our childhood moral upbringing where ma and pop told us about right and wrong and we still wish it were that simple and clear and that bullies got their comeuppance some people never grow up and see this sort of thing for what it iswishful simplistic thinking others know what it is but find it appealing anyway for the part of me that is such a person a couple stars for doing a decent job of it in this show this show is also full of extremely good looking people any heterosexual female is going to dampen herer palms watching this the action scenes are unevensome pretty good and interesting and some fakey and in violation of the laws of physics the presentday plots are utterly predictable the resolutions simpleminded as is the romance the backstory scenes were interesting in the first few episodes but paled quickly as of this writing the show has gotten repetitive already minus three stars for immediate fake negative votes of the first version of this review in case the shows makers paid for those which is a sleazy practice i watched all the shows said to be the best of the fall 2012 season for at least two eps each and this is indeed one of the better ones but its not actually good
