go colonize mars instead what was the point of the mission? to save humanity how? by evacuating all of earth on huge space stations to another planet accessible through a black hole near saturn and you need to gather data about the singularity to finish the antigravity equation to do it 1 direct trip from earth to saturn = 8 round trips from earth to mars so go colonize mars instead also the robot design was very impractical ps who colonizeslands on a planet with a 1 hour = 7 years outside time anomaly? pointless suicide
