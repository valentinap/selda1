i am so disappointed in this movie the ratings gave me high expectations for this movie but i feel really let down this movie was meant to capture the true essence and experience of growing up and going through life it is directed and acted out so neutrally to try to make the movie as real as possible but this is not reality reality has more emotion more struggle more comedy and more life life is not an objective biography or recollection of events it is a subjective frenzy i can make a movie of me watching this movie and make it more alive tldr this movie about life is more boring than life itself
