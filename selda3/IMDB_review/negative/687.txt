i dont know what the academy was thinking when it gave the return of the king those 11 awards it did not deserve a single one especially best picture lost in translation mystic river cold mountain and even seabiscuit were all far better those films actually had depth and meaning where as the lord of the rings is just like titanic a bunch of shotty acting and film making covered up with tons of high budget special effects neither film deserved their awards and both in my view are among the most overrated and crappiest films in history i wish the academy would stop choosing the films that are the most popular or will give them the greatest approval rating
