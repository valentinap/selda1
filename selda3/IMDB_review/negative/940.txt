against all that has been said in praise of this movie i just hated it cant we get back to real movies without all the special effects i walked out before it ended and cant think of anything i really liked how could anyone suggest heath ledger could get an oscar for his performance with his face covered in make up he went through the complete movie with one expressionit is a very dark movie in all senses of the word with little humour and a boring and predictable storylinethe same thing has happened to the new bond movies ruined by special effects and a desperate desire to look modern much of the humour has disappeared romance is hardly there not surprising as the females spend much of the time doing kung foo or shooting off gunsas for the music well all i can say is that it is tuneless which should make it to the top of the charts
