its amusing to see all the brilliant comments about this crap film fincher a smoke and mirrors hack who is convinced that more is more wants to sell you on the idea that were living shallow lives the proofs in the pudding here folks he bashes you over the head with his themes like a college sophomore he is a master of the odious puerile wouldnt it be cool if this happened school of story construction the film is filled with desperate attempts at comedy mostly of the grossout toilet variety  so no doubt the sub20 dilettantes are enthralled  but the film is walltowall form over substance most annoying are finchers pet signature moments  youll see them in all his worthless work mention a pilot light  and voilÃ  the camera flies around a stove and shows you a pilot light presumably he finds this is magical as he repeats it everywhere  but we know its simply his unleashed attention whore personality being imposed where it doesnt belong theres no need to spoil the ending  its obvious to any thinking person within the first 10 minutes whats going on f
