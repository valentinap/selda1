the dark knights box office takings were recently overtaken by those of toy story 3 frankly im not at all surprised the disney picture blows this away in terms of sheer entertainment what christopher nolan does not seem to have grasped is the utter absurdity of the main character batman is a nut who runs round gotham city in a rubber suit solving crimes the 1966 series movie with adam west and burt ward got him about right it was played entirely for laughs tdk takes him very seriously indeed big mistake christian bale is bland as wayne batman and heath ledgers joker cannot hold a bat candle compared to cesar romeros and jack nicholsons earlier portrayals had ledger not been foolish enough to die just before the film opened i doubt whether anyone would have given it the time of day tdk also squanders the talents of the lovely maggie gyllenhaal brilliant in secretary the film as a whole is bleak ugly and depressing not my idea of a fun movie at all i think ill stick with the excellent tim burton joel schumacher quartet of the 80s 90s no more edgy batman pictures okay
