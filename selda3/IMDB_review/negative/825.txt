i was expecting much more from this film with a imdb rating of 91 silly me and i was disappointed it left me untouched and uninspired 99 % of the time i found the dialogues and the script most of the time boring there is a psychopathic hyper criminal with mass destruction capabilities btw he would have to hire a whole army of commandos just to place and wire all that tnt gasoline barrels etc without anyone notice and the police and the batman are trying to arrest him or save his victims while we the viewers are watching their efforts for 2 and a half hours now what is the point to have fun sorry it wasnt much fun some sfx was good and thats all some other wasnt convincing at all there wasnt anything special to remember about this film nothing special in script in acting in action in sfx and most of all nothing inspiring and diachronic we should demand more quality from the movies not just explosions and killings with impossible enemies the money we spend and especially the time we spend to watch it should worth it we should exit the theaters with a feeling that we have gained something special not the opposite edit on a second thought 3 stars which i gave it initially might give the wrong impression so there you are 1 star for your lousy film try harder next time
