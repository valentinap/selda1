how could this movie possibly have received so much acclaim ok its competently executed both in terms of acting and production values but then with the money spent on it hopefully that should be taken for granted and certainly it has some fine actors in it and they give every impression of fully believing in their work but what the heck is the point of it supposed to be im sorry but i just absolutely hated it it reminds me of a local case in the press here in toronto a while ago where some art student made a movie of a cat being tortured to death since he actually tortured a cat to death to make it he was charged and prosecuted and his defence was that it was art well at least all the people tortured and killed in this movie presumably were only faking it and werent actually hurt but i still dont think it has any more claim to be worthwhile or to be art its obnoxious rubbish and i strongly suggest that if you havent seen it and are considering doing so you think of some better use for your time which would be pretty much anything not actually harmful to your health or anybody elses
