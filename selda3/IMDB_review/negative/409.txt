i have not read the book but will now just in the hope of finding something that justifies the hype around this story the film was like a farce which to me verged on the comical with the cartoonesque type characters another reviewer comments that had this been billed as a dark comedy it might have just cut the mustard and with that i agree but a tense psychological thriller? no way it was not cleverly written there were plot holes galore the diary really bugged meeven after slight burning i think they could have told that it had been recently writtenand the whole of amys escape story was just utter hogwash the acting was abysmal with the exception of carrie coon margowho presented the only sympathetic and remotely realistic character in the whole thing not my cup of tea at all
