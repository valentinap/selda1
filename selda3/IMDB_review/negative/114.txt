this dreary  boring  depressing  and overly long scifi flick is about the dying earth and the last desperate attempts to repopulate another world with human beings  unless you are stephen hawking or neil degrasse tyson or you possess a degree in quantum physics  thermodynamics  time warps  black holes and worm holes you will not understand all of the technical jargon the viewer is constantly bombarded with  to make matters worse matthew mcconaughey is probably the best mumbler in hollywood  i did not understand a single line that came out of his face  anyway the great dust bowl of the 1930s has returned to wreck havoc on the world only this time it really means business  matthew mcconaughey  the worlds greatest astronaut turned farmer  is chosen to be the earths savior  his interstellar space craft endurance is capable of traveling through the vastness of space and time  it is also armored like a battleship that can withstand explosions  collisions  and a gigantic tsunami wave 1000 feet high  anne hathaway is the cryogenics expert  she looks a lot more convincing playing catwoman than the endurances genius co astronaut  this movie is quite confusing for the average movie goer with an iq of under 140 to comprehend  interstellar is gloomy and awful and definitely not worthy of your two and a half hours  i would recommend george pals 1951 scifi classic  when worlds collide  over this boring and lifeless piece of space junk   not hot pwh
