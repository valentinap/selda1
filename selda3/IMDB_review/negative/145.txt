the movie would be descent if it wasnt 3 hours long found myself and my friend begging for the ending so we could walk out the theater as we were somewhere in the middle of the row i love the concept but i think its too linear  no major twists in the story that could come from nowhere everything is so predictable and could be packed in a maximum of 100 minutes also the soundtrack was killing me throughout the whole movie too sad and without energy not moving enough i think that the soundtrack was there to kill any thrill you could enjoy watching this film the animations are 1010 but overall i was glad when i finally got out the theater so  110 is my final verdict
