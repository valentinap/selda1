 the shawshank redemption is a movie about a hotshot banker named andy dufresnetim robbins who is convicted of murdering his wife and is imprisoned in shawshank prison he remains hopeful and makes friends especially with a blackmarketeer named red morgan freeman i really dont see how this movie could possibly be the #2 film of all time the movie is nothing groundbreakingly amazing it is pretty poorly directed the plot is thinner than airthere are no risks takenand there is no thought provoked through watching the film that it only needs to one viewing to get the whole movie in fact you wouldnt even need to watch the film to even understand how the movie is going end the title already gives away the whole big finale of the movie i dont see how anyone could possibly compare this to actually great movies like everything that is below is on the top 25 and the simple thought of this winning best picture back in 94 hahahahahahaha it would have given me somethingh to laugh at for the rest of my life i still cant possibly see how the academy could have even nominated this as the best picture of 1994 anyway the only thing that saves the film of morgan freeman and it is only thing that even got me to see this film in the first place but it still cant stop me from giving this a poor grade 2 10
