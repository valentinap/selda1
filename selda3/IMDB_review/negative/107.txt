this had a lot going for it a charismatic willing star who could really carry off a fantastic character a juicy betrayal to get the tale going and a lot of great special effects but unfortunately you cant stop there story pacing supporting cast winning characters? oops ‹ we blew the budget with ajs wings and the cgi so so  is it a spoiler to say that the plot pretty much goes nowhere and that by the end you are so dying for it to be over you dont even care what happens?? if good conflict is what drives a good narrative does the absence of any good conflict  very much the case with this plodding slackly handled drearathon  make a bad one? the worst thing about this which leaves quite a bad taste in your mouth is that in redeeming the character of maleficent they decide to depict that she wasnt a mean old spinster she was a deeply loving maternal figure who was just bitter cuz she got royally screwed over by a guy she trusted its so schmaltzy its kitsch im a guy and this stuff offends my paltry feminism considering some of the takenoprisoners characters that aj plays and plays well i am surprised she even took this part but i suspect it was doing a screen test with the kudu horns on i might have even taken the part just to wear those oh and this movie at press time had a 71 rating i mean come on i know this is more or less a kids movie but a good kids movie is good so we can just go ahead and say that a bad kids movie is bad just take a similar movie enchanted  which had great songs a fantastic cast a charming funny sweet and complex story it is rated at 72
