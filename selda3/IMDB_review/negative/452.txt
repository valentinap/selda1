i am really amazed at the good reviews this is getting on here as i found it a huge disappointment absolutely nothing about it makes any sense in fact no single moment in the film follows logically from anything that was happening 15 minutes earlier the science is ridiculous a sixinch deep ocean with 200foot waves is one of the more believable elements the motivation of the characters changes from minute to minute and they seem bound and determined to make the worst choice whenever faced with a decision the special effects are unimaginative kubrick did it all better without cgi 50 years ago the bombastic musics only virtue is that it drowns out the ludicrous dialogue and the final resolution of the central mystery is utterly nonsensical involving manually transmitting what must be many many gigabytes of data in morse code via the second hand of an old wristwatch wt*? definitely not recommended
