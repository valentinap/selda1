first let me say that this movie does not deserve only one star my real rating would be a six to an eight depending on your taste in movies but i had to compensate compensate for what well literary device im glad you asked tools‰Û_the answer is tools no not instruments used to construct objects or to do maintenance work around the house such as a hammer or screw driver im talking about people people who are easily swayed by other peoples opinions and by mass marketing campaigns unfortunately almost everyone in america including myself is subject to tooldom from time to time so we can really only judge others based on the extent and frequency to which a person is a tool now i realize that these tools sound pretty scary so here is a trick you can use to spot and avoid the biggest of these flaming idiots if they have ever given the dark knight 10 10 stars or referred to it as one of the greatest movies of all time well then lil miss daisy im afraid you have a huge tool on your hands i recommend immediate euthanasia why this movie is not up to par is covered thoroughly in other negative reviews i simply felt the need to explain why there are so many overwhelmingly positive reviews its quite simple really the media told everyone they should like‰Û_so they did these people then went out and told their friends that they should like it‰Û_so they did and these friends then went out and told other friends that they should like it‰Û_so they did so it went until one day tdk topped the list of imdbs greatest movies of all time what it boils down to is that this is your basic super hero movie that got really good media coverage had the initial media coverage been negative and heath ledger god rest his soul not died at an unfortunately opportunistic time for hollywood this never would of happened basically what im saying is someone told you this movie was good so you went into it with a positive attitude and were willing to ignore some of the flaws and while the revelation that going into something with a positive attitude will make the experience better for you might not surprise you or anyone else on the planet i feel that the warm fuzzy feeling towards this movie has gotten to a point of excess too many people told you it was good you went into it with too positive an attitude and you ignored too many of the flaws this movies current average 9 10 is absurd and a perfect example of why all my scathing comments about tools in the previous paragraph are justified its an ok movie and a good movie if you like action movies and are willing to ignore glaring plot holes like the villain spitting in the face of physics and being able to do or be anything anywhere at any time he wanted
