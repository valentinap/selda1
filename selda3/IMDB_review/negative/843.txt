 yes thats right crap this film is just that if you take a closer look at fex bruce willis who seems to make people scream their head off every time hes near the screen you can clearly see that this person lacks personality he has two expressions one that says on with a little wrinkle above his nose the other is of course off when hes asleep a machine of a man which perhaps cries a bit when he comes home because hes in desperate need for a personality some feelings a higher iq and an even bigger paycheck why this person has become so popular has to do with you mindless people out there voting cheering and stamping your feet for talentless and retarded actors musicians artists etc that is why this world goes straight down the toilette making your modern remarks that everything is so cool all the time pulp fiction is at best a bad joke from a below average director there is no inventions no good or natural acting no deeper meaning with this movie at all just exploitation the era of good movie productions are long gone classic actors like chaplin bogart cooper peck holden and quinn dont get born any more today its just you gray and unpersonalized people out there with some exceptions watching to see if theres something that can kill your brain even more with splatter and gore above your ears yeah youre a really cool bunch drowning on dry land
