 the director was pretty jealous of the fact that a movie has to end otherwise this movie would never have had an end an interesting start the first movie of the trilogy fellowship of the ring but absolutely boring on the road to the end of it im disappointed with this movie as ive expected more of it the characters seemed wonderful at the beginning but the director made the worst of them shameful more shameful as this is the movie that won the oscar i cannot think of the motives the academy awarded the prize to this movie but the money that went into it its the second time in the history that i know of that the academy appreciates more the cost of a movie than the quality of it and of the actors play its interesting in this approach that no actor in this movie won the oscar why is that
