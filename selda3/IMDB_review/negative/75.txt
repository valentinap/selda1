this movie is not 1 out of 10 but i have to give this rating so that we can balance its position interstellar tries too much to make you belief it is all about science but the truth is that it is not  i can can say until matt damon appears in the movie everything goes well from that point absurdity and nonsense begin what the hell is a space ship hanging out into a black hole like taking a walk on the street every 3 dimensional object turns into light or energy with black holes incredible and unmeasurable gravity however our full of science movie demonstrates that you can get rid off a black hole with a jet engine  after that scene i realized that this film is way too much more fiction than science what about our hero walks into a black hole at one piece  oops i forget he is into a space outfit it explains everything  this film acts like the gravity movie but in fact its more like star trek
