if you ever saw kubricks 2001 then do not waste your time in this movie if you did notthen rent or buy 2001 and avoid this piece of crap interstellar is a dumb and lazy written cash cow disguised as a philosophical statement inception was the same thing but less stupid and more entertaining or at least had more action and violence  do not be fooled by the concept there are just one or two interested statements in this movie but taking three hours for that is excessive the whole things must make sense in nolans depressing mind the world is ending but people is still selfish enough to make matters worse the movie has zero humor and the positive or hopeful message is as fake as the special effects in fact this is a movie about god but nolans refuse to even refer about religion so the movie is about something that is never clear and makes absolutely no sense ***spoiler ahead*** without saying too much about the first ending there is a second happy ending to ensure better box office receipts and is even more absurd  why whoever could create such a device just pass the message and solve the problem ? ***end of spoiler*** mcconaughey is talk is almost incomprehensible anne hathaway is always good but his character is under written jessica chastain has to deal a completely absurd and unbelievable and over dramatized situations and she does not succeed in brief do not commit the same error i made save your money for a better and more sincere money this one is just a scam
