so the big movie of the yearthe big thinker even came up on 9gag asking is this possible i got excited oh boywas i wrong the movie is just terrible they are just throwing that space terminology around like potatoes and people think yea this is smart movie very insightful and out of the box thinking and smart and stephen hawking theorylike way of describing something the people that sayit is great and i got the movie are just arrogant 323i4h5 trying to look intelligent a lot of corners left for questioning and i hate the movie where i watch and ask out loud why the duck did you do that or why the duck didnt you say that when it is obvious it needs more explaining it all is based on us accepting some facts that they say in the movie only because they use few scientific concepts like neutron stars spinning black holes and time dilation but the rest is just pure guessing and in a bad way looks like nolan wanted to try and give it a shot and in 100 years if he got it right people will sayyea there was some guy nolan the producer and he was talking about this in the 2015but i doubt it i gave review for only two movies on imdb this one and batman dark knight risesboth same crap or maybe i am just oblivious and dumb for all of the people giving 88 on imdb
