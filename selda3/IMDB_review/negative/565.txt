david fincher i think his career might have been a tragedy if he actually made some good early films he had alot of promise but is now sucked into the world of the fanboy where he reins as their god this world is made up of angry youth most of whom like computers violence and sex though they are under experienced with it in actuality no more evident is this than in fight club if you need proof read one of the hundred claims that this is the pinnacle of filmmaking since these people are cultish and do not listen to reasonable argument i will waste so much time as to actually give the entire argument against this film as i see it i think fincher actually had a message however he has no control over his own abilities i think using logic his film is about the value of the individual this is extremely ironic since his film has inspired homogenous worshipers the first third of the film is a damnation of the working environment the last third is im guessing supposed to be a damnation of the second third the second third is the escape from the working class through a violent cult this is only the most logical explanation for me anyway i think many people fail to see the last third as a damnation of the second third because fincher creates it as such a paradise juxtaposed next to the working week fincher is too seduced by his own tricks that he cant convey his own message and we as viewers are left with the remnants of a very negative film with no purpose for its violent destructive nature and no redeeming values at all so maybe it isnt what the film is about most of its fans would gladly join up with the cult and follow tyler into chaos the message of the film is really quite hollow and the way it is done is just silly 310
