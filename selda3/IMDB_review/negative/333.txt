if this is what passes for blockbuster entertainment these days then after 50 years of cinemagoing im opting out for good are the filmmakers of the 21st century so devoid of originality that everything has to be a cut and paste from the past? so a brief run through of the tedium that passes for plot from that most dreaded of all auteurs the writerdirector a dude from the past 1988 gets taken into space subhitchhiker galaxystyle and gets to spout substar wars dialogue in a subspaceballs kinda plot i was looking at my watch after the first half hour there was no irony or intelligence in the story the hero takes off his space helmet in the vacuum of space and hands it over to the sourfaced flatchested star trek reboot and they both survive the director could have at least looked at total recall if the physics were too tough for him if they can censor the best part of zulu for alleged raaacism then i truly hope this garbage gets shredded for stupidity and cynicism a sequel is naturally in the works god bless you stanley kubrick
