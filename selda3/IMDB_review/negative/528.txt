any one who read dc comics will tell you green arrow is a poor mans batman so to speak that being said with all the copywrite garbage i am sure it is easier to get rights to make a green arrow show rather than a new batman show this still doesnt excuse how horrible this thing is a friend referred it to me as a great show with the flash in it they dont cover the flash at all really just a short cameo with normal barry allen i would encourage you to watch a daytime soap opera then watch this garbage and tell me the difference the acting is horrible the writing is so awful that it must be done by drunken monkeys they randomly put a villain in the clock tower and arrows crew wonders where he is they should just move their headquarters there if they ask laural one more time is something wrong i will punch my tv
