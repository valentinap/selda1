oscars coming up next month  which nominee do i wish to see??? after much debate with my wife and friends we decide on boyhood flashback 11 years oscars coming up next month  which nominee do i wish to see??? after much debate with my wife and friends we decide on lost in translation back to present im sitting here recalling the two worst movie decisions of my life craziest thing would be if boyhood actually wins best picture ha as we all watched our backsides getting numb we occasionally exchanged puzzled looks at each other as if to say what the heck is going on here? the movie much like its 11 year old predecessor made all of us ask how could we all be so different from the critics that raved about this movie its only claim to fame appears to be that it took so many years to film it duh we have things nowadays in hollywood called make up and multiple actors that pull off time changes with no problem  just look at benjamin button ive seen better hidden camera performances than this scripted documentary displayed i would believe that the director didnt have to say action hed just say act normally mason and nicole have a great little chuckle at the end of the movie they know what they just pulled off what a waste of time 35mm and money
