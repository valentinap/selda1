another example of an over hyped movie but now in extreme to say this piece of junk should be regarded as the best movie of 2008 is ridiculous basicaly it is just another movie about a man in a bat suit who duels for more than 2 hours with another badman with a painted smile and in the process some quasi profound remarks are exchanged no humor in sight to make the movie better digestible big budget good actors and some clever make up artists are no guarantee for a good movie in this case it resulted in a very boring one as for the so called performance of the year by ledger he is was a very good actor but this one dimensional role is far from being special but i guess the oscar will be his nil nisi bonum why this movie should be on par with or far better than true masterpieces like the godfather 1&2 and vertigo is beyond belief
