for years my boyfriend has been insisting that i watch this film finally i did big mistake my issues with this film are multiple the pacing of the film is just terrible its soooooooo slow and yet at the same time rushes through many things leaving many questions unanswered character development is beyond terrible especially when it comes to michael who goes from nice guy who is nothing like his family to sociopath with no shades of grey in between the relationships are also poor one minute michael is in love with kay the next minute hes in sicily and in what feels like 5 minutes married to apollonia then about 5 minutes later shes dead and hes home and married to kay before apollonia corpse is even cold smaller issues include the fact that michael seems to have a black eye for approximately a year either that or he spent about a week abroad in which time he managed to get married also would have been nice to know what happened to connie after getting beaten up by her husband clearly she must have phoned sonny i assume did she lose the child or is that the child that michael was godfather to if so where did michaels 4 year old son come from i guess i was asleep when that was explained or maybe id just lost the will to live all in all i found the film slow boring and rife withe cardboard cut out characters my tip avoid especially if you watch with someone who loves the film
