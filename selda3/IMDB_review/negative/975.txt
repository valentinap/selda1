this movie was 1 way too long 2 way way too long 3 tried to do too much 4 made me believe that jake gyllenhall is a more believable love interest than his sister sorry shes just very plain looking and a mediocre actress at best 5 lost the dialog in an overwhelming music score 6 had a horrible script 7 ledger is the best thing about the film but no one could live up to the hype sadly he will not be able to reprise this role 8 put every good scene in the trailers and fooled everyone by doing so 9the people who made this knew it is a stinker and sold it hard on the net 10 had an over and over and over feel to it i started looking at my watch about 45 minutes into the movie and about every 10 minutes thereafter i thought it would never end and then the ending was blah i have read stuff here about maggie gyllenhall being a better actress that katie holmes well she may be but katie holmes was much more believable than she was in the role she was unwatchable she ruined the movie for me because no one could believe that she was being fought over by two handsome men i almost puked when the joker says hello beautiful and some one in the theater actually called out shes a beast the first movie was great this one just really disappointing go see it i wont have such high expectations again the honest vote should be a 5 but i lowered it to account for the deluded and blind
