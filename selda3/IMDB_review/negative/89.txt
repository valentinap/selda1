this is weird i love science fiction and i love astrophysics but disliked everything about this movie the start was extremely slow and it was hard to stay awake the second half of the movie was somewhat better but felt like a very cheap ripoff of space 2001 the movie just didnt do it for me at all and the acting was average im totally flabbergasted that the average rating stands at 9 out of 10 maybe audiences have lost the notion of quality storyline plot acting and uniqueness  as this movie doesnt have any of it ah well i guess ill just have to wait for the next sf movie and hope it will be somewhat better because i am deeply disappointed by interstellar as i expected so much more from a movie with an estimated budget of $165 million
