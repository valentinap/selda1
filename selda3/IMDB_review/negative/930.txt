 ok i know i am not that well versed on all the action comics from which these movies are made but this batman was one of the worst films i have ever seen that is based on an action figure true the acting from some of the main characters was very goodthe joker by heath ledger and batman by christine balealthough his batman voice gave me the creeps buthaving seen the movie four hours ago all i now remember is car chases explosions a hospital being blown upthe noise was so loud i had to hold my earsand such intolerable camera work that i became totally dizzy and had to look away it took me a long time to know who was whomaybe i am slow to understand but the plot was so incomprehensible to me jumping from scene to scene that i kept looking at my watchwhere was the real fun that i remember even that old batman series on tv in the 80s was so entertaining robinthe penguincatwomanand the plot was so simpleno digital enhancementsjust good scary fun for the kids remember the on screen bam zoom kerplunk etc it was funfunfor adults as well as kids how could kids feel comfortable watching thisa gun held to the head of a little boyso much darknessand things blown away how this could be rated #1 in theaters is all about hypethe deathsadly of heath ledger who i thought was an unforgettable joker but a little scary for kids i kept asking my son who are the good guys and who are the bad ones it really left me empty the script was boringthe dialogue empty and the acting predictable i loved the fantastic four spiderman and the x men they had clever scripts and good character development in the dark knight there was none of this pleaseto parents out there dont waste your money and dont scare your kidsthis movie is boring loud and an utter disappointmenti do not care how much money it has made so far wait for it on dvd or do yourself a favour and pass on this mixed up melange of drivel
