boyhood is truly an amazing film terrible awkward cringeinducing dialogue boring uninspired cinematografy awful poorly written characters no story to keep you interested also dont forget that the movies really long too it almost feels twice the 12 years lets be serious here they are saying the movies revolutionary it took twelve years to make but if you think about it harry potter franchise is same kind of thing as this film except with actual characters and plot but really some people dare to call this movie a masterpiece? hmm i think i will release my childhood movies they were recorded in span of 12 years im pretty sure ill get an oscar in the conclusion spare yourself your sanity and dont watch this film im pretty sure that once you get outside of the cinema you will feel 12 years older i got gray because of that movie
