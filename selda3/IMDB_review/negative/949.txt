this film is long and dull as a result of the first it is dull for very long periods which is why this film warrants no more than a miserly 1 10 the acting is competent but no more and i must confess i lost my focus towards the end due to the quite shocking lack of entertainment that can be attributed to a poor script lacklustre direction and a plot which leaves a lot to be desired people say godfather is rare in that its sequel improves upon it but that isnt hard al pacino gained a big reputation from this one and i am left bemused as to why and this unfortunate idea has meant pacino a mediocre actor at best has been able to infiltrate our cinema screens on far too many occasions with a distinct lack of passion or charisma in any role he displays
