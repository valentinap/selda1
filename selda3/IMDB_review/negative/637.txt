this is easily one of the worst films ever created the beginning i must admit is different and quite intriguing i mean who would have ever thought of a guy who is addicted to 12 step programs but the minute that brad pitts face hits the screen we are soon forced into mind numbing senseless violent trash i think that violence must be used for a purpose such in reserviour dogs or raging bull in these movies we see violence as a tool to push the desperation and hopelessness of the main characters in fight club we see violence as a tool to drive along a bunch of nonsense possibly the only reason i could see for all of the fights was for the male characters to bring out their pent up freudian fantasies for violence if you want an immature movie where men beat the cp out of each other for no reason then go ahead bon appetite but if you want a movie that has any intelligence or sense of reality then please do your self a favor and spend your money elsewhere
