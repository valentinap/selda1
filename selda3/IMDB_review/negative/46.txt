truly one of the most ludicrous films ever made virtually every moment of the film comprises a series of linked premises without any one of them having a rational basis the film depends upon multiple concepts regarding spacetime and space travel most of which the audience is sufficiently familiar with to appreciate the potential story  but  each one of those is then formulated and entered into the storyline in a way that you cannot suspend belief the series of presumptions just accumulate one ludicrous outcome after another just in time to be posted straight into another ludicrous presumption so what builds is a stack of preposterous situations that can really only be resolved by yet another even more ludicrous outcome this causes the late stages of the film to become so disjointed that the basic premise collapses note that the suspension of belief is of course fundamental to many films  in star trek for example one suspends belief in accepting that faster than light travel is possible  or falling asleep inside your own dreams is believable as in inception  and thats aok because the rest of the action is consistent however the number of presumptions you have swallow in interstellar that have no basis in science fiction or reality strains credulity way past breaking point one at least has to see a consistency for a film to be acceptable notwithstanding these comments the individual elements are each highly watchable and nolan does his usual blinding literally in couple of the shots best the environments and space scenes are quite breathtaking however watching the film is a cascaded cataclysm of ideas concepts halftheories impossibilities broken linkages and downright wrongness that appears on the screen like confetti in a gale the disappointment is that the cast of actors is sensational and they do everything they can to make the film a coherent reality  but the outcome it to make them look like patsies to a conspiracy  possibly the only saving grace is the final 38 seconds  where the original oneline filmpitch made to the moneyboys gets playedout  but its probably too little too late
