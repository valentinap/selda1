despite the clever crafting of this film it is basically a complainfest about the poor upperclass privileged white male blaming all his woes on ikea is this the extent of selfproclaimed victimization that is taking over american culture disturbingly to any intellectuals this movies amorality passes itself off under the guise of reason  as if the central character has a logic to his rage and subsequent violent decisions  as if the poor young white businessman whos been educated well and raised in an upper middle class lifestyle with all the benefits really is some sort of victim of retail stores is it really proving a coherent point to blow something up its even more upsetting to think about this after seeing 911 take this films logic into realityis the point of this movie to say that american commercial freedom should be attacked with all the sexification and glamorizing of violence and its poorme ranting against consumer products rather than taking responsibility for ones own commercialism or participation in it its hard to find a redeemable netsum to this movie ed norton is as always terrific brad pitt very good in this role too and i very much appreciate the filmmakers talent but i wish he would use it for something that was thoughtful
