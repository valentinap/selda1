two great movies in my opinion are the game and seven both directed by david fincher so obviously i went into fight club wanting to love it and i did well the first half anyway from there on it went straight downhill into just another hollywoodproduced uncreative clonemovie i could go in and pinpoint the exact frame where the film turns from an intriguing smart drama into an unimaginitive hybrid of two of the worst movies that ive seen the matrix and dark city all three of these movies seem to have a common newage theme they all convey the message the individual can do anything and as long as they don t seek aid from an outside source their power is limitless maybe these antiestablishment  antireligion ideals are just a faze in modern media but it could also be the direction the industry will be heading in the future as for fight club on its own brad pitt and edward norton play their parts well and the movie does have some redeeming elements but overall i cant recommend it but dont let that dissuade you from seeing the movie id never say dont see this movie you should always see the movie to have an opinion of your own just watch this one with your eyes open
