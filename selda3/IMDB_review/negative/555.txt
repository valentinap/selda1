after watching fight club and before writing this comment here i have watched it 6 times myself alone to find out why it got so many ratings and votes from the audiences just after 2000 i had watched lots and numerous movies existing in the world but so far no single comments are available here in this imdb now i am in bound to express my personal feelings about this unnecessarily overrated movie i find nothing special in this dumb and irritating fight club starring brad pitt and edward norton why did this movie got good stars and many comments just because others are dancing and so they too blindly dancing with them after getting into the story of tyler durden david fincher  i think david is good at making movies based on mental sickness human illusion and social understanding he could have used the actors in better perspective to make the whole story clearer than it is fight club  this movie was actually flopped when it released theatrically worldwide so can we really consider it as a hit or blockbuster no doubt it got momentum when it later came out in dvd i was mostly displeased with the twisting climax which has nothing special to thrill the human mind it is just simple to predict in some points of the story there are some scenes which make bored and eagerly wait to move forward in the next scenes this is not a case with good thrillers like the bourne trilogy series the peacemaker collateral jeepers creepers the recruit paycheck the shooter the departed or say impostor  for my 8 years of continuously watching different types of movies and analysing the choices of the audiences i came to confusion why audiences really admired this movie well it might have became a cultfilm for creating the ideas of building fight clubs but this movie actually has a negative and improper purposes the twisted ending seems to be much dissatisfying in catching the truth but in fact the movie has no concern with the worlds reality brad pitt  i wonder why brad pitt accepted the role as an illusionary tyler durden who rule the narrators way of living surprisingly he turned out as nonexisting person who appears from schizophrenic narrator jack norton i like pitt a lot his role in kalifornia and se7ven and mr & mrs smith but not here edward norton  i was really impressed by his role in only 2 hits  rounders and the italian job but this time also he won my heart for his innocence and ignorant role as jack he did his role as demanded by the script and the director or the producers he was a right choice for this role better than others helena bonham carter  she does not have the necessary looks to become a star or celebrity but by chance she got good remarks for her role here no impressions exist from her role as marla singer but only to look once
