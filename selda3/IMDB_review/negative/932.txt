my comments refer only to the 2008 usa release aspect ratio 235 1 widescreen version not the imax aspect ration 144 1 which could potentially be better sorry but the movie was awful not worth the money special effects aside gadgets and the batmobile which is a dream automobile the movie runs 152 minutes too long unnecessary ending but most importantly does not have any resemblance to the original batman series or the comic books neither in character nor intent best of the movie is the director christopher nolanhis attention to detail and superb sequencesie bus braking out of the bank the capture and return of lau chin han the explosion and the capture of the joker heath ledger the characters are very intense especially the joker bruce wayne batman & harvey dent two face the best and worst of the actors ill start with the worse morgan freeman and michael caine both accomplished actors they are probably two of the finest alive sir caine was the worst of the supporting characters neither of the two were convincing they failed in their craft both were consistently bad actors in this film the best was heath ledger hands down his performance was top notch consistent but above all spectacular there will be a sequel to batman the dark knight which sincerely hope will be better
