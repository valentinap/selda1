i dont have a huge amount to say about this film as i feel absolutely nothing happens within the space of 3 very long hours for those of you who have taken the time to read my review and have watched the film i have a question would you praise this film to the extent that is has been if you hadnt watched the actors grow up over the course of 12yrs? would this film have been as critically acclaimed if they had used different actors as they grew like the majority of films? my personal answer is no and my reason being that the dialogue is tedious thrown in with a lot of unlikable characters im not denying the concept is brilliant and original however overall this film did nothing for me except remind me the annoyance of puberty
