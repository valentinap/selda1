the reviews score here made me look forward to watching this movie but what a disappointment it was i am seriously wondering what is wrong with todays audience when a movie like this get such good reviews maybe its just a wrong idea of science fiction maybe people label budget fantasy movies science fiction ? anyway lets have a quick look at some of the bad point of this movie first the lead actor i dont know how he is perceived in the us but looking with an european view mcconaughey is just plain horrible at acting he has no facial expressions and talks english with a slow slur that is really annoying then later on in the movie i see a good actor like topper grace and wonder what the casting director thought when shehe hired mcconaughey there is just no emotional connection between him and any of the other characters even when he cries it feels like someone just drop some vaseline over his face and he just sits there waiting till its lunch again mcconaughey should be a car salesman not an actor then there is the pace of this slow moving epic we spend god knows how many hours in some dust bowl house where people stare outside and drive in pickup trucks with high technology equipment to bring down indian drones for using their solar panels to probably power an old play station 3 i kid you not the way the lead manages to find the secret nasa base is laughable there is a base with literally hundreds of people working there in the middle of a field without the huge parking lot for all their pickups trucks remember earth is dying so everyone has a v8 pickup to find indian drones then there is the so called science in the movie apparently they even hired a professor to help them with the science part well dear professor please join mcconaughey as a car salesman as you dont have one clue about science and if the audience thinks the movie is using it i have a bad feeling about the future of our species the radiation the fact that they walk about on a planet with sun light orbiting a black hole where we have so much gravity that every hour there is 7 years on earth and even the same for the station they left orbiting just 200 miles up is just one silly example of course mcconaughey has no problems with relativity time shifts once he enters the black hole of course how could he otherwise meet up with his dying daughter to make a real american ending to this disaster of a movie then there is the robot made for a budget movie looking so cheap and probably assembled from cardboard with aluminum foil  as you can see it almost bobbing about in the wind two obligatory lcd panels show scrolling text as the robot talks and stumbles about that robot sets the level for the special effects they look cheap  badly filmed from the perspective of the space ship most of the time as if they had some plastic contraption with a gopro attached to it handled by a 12 year old going bzzzzzzz as he moves it about yes its that bad there are many bad movies around and this is just one of them but what baffles me is why this piece of overlong budget fantasy gets so many good reviews did the people here not see other movies ever ? did they miss alien gravity or even star wars not that the last one is science fiction but at least its entertaining and this was not hoping hollywood wakes up at some point and starts making movies again with depth and science instead of cheap fantasy aimed at  yeah what is the target audience for this and mcconaughey please leave the movie industry and join the nearest chevy dealer
