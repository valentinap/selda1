not that funny at all it was a total embarrassment this was one of those movies in which i wish i could have put a bag over my head while walking out the theater because i was too embarrassed for people to see that i had gone to this movie the good ol f word seems to make up most of the script the movie was filled with stupid scenes very little of anything original came out of this film i thought the scene with freebird blasting would never end this was just plain embarrassing tell the writers and producers to please make some better movies than this im really trying to forget i went to this movie so this gets two thumbs down
