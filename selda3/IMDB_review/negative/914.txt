yes joker was really great but overall this movie was a total letdown a few totally stupid things that killed this movie for me spoilers joker blows up a freaking hospital in broad freaking daylight and makes his escape in an ultra fast school bus which no cop seems able to stop even though theyve been warned that joker will you know blow up a hospital you see this is totally believable because the cops apparently set up a perimeter two freaking miles away just to be safe its not like they could have used a helicopter or something for surveillance that would just make too much sense sarcasm batman falls several stories to the ground not once but twice and gets up without so much as a broken bone but hey thats okay because his super duper special armor which is so strong that a dog can chew through it protected him from the fall thats totally realistic right whats that you say the metal roof of the taxi totally cushioned his fall well thats even better how wonderfully realistic if i ever have to jump out of a burning building its nice to know that a kevlar vest and a strategically placed car will break my fall police commissioner gordon pretends to be dead so that joker will chase after harvey dent instead of his family huh and joker proceeds to kill six innocent people in the middle of downtown chicago uh gotham city but this is okay because by drawing the joker out the police are protecting the public from harm no reason to clear the streets of pedestrians and traffic and stuff while transporting harvey dent as bait for a sicko maniac killer joker manages to keep a pencil perfectly balanced on a table while a large gangster stomps across the floor to fight him cool but stupid joker burns a pyramid of money because you see money is not important to him whats important to him is blowing and burning stuff up which is exactly why he robs banks for a living makes perfect sense no batman speaks with an annoying rasp which hides his bruce wayne voice because as everyone knows christopher nolan wants this to be a realistic depiction of batman which is why we have sonar cell phones in this movie and magic armor and explosive laced bat mobiles that turn into motorcycles which do gravity defying 360 turns on walls other complaints there was no wayne manor in this film no bat cave chicago looks a bit too bright and modern to be gotham city seriously what is gotham city without you know gothic architecture the girl playing rachel dawes is completely ugly but for some reason bruce wayne is so obsessed with her that he decides to have sex with the whole gotham city ballet just so she cant go on a date with harvey dent i know lots of people got drawn into the hype of seeing heath ledgers last great performance but besides joker there is no redeeming value in this film theres no iconic battles no real hero to root for seriously you will hate batman in this movie christopher nolan gets a special mention for trying to inject at least some intelligence into a summer blockbuster but there was just one too many stupid things to justify the price of admission if you havent seen this film just wait for it on dvd
