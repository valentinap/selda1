i watched end of days directly after this disjointed feature and the ahnold piece came out looking like the godfather there was a lot of talk when alien3 came out that david finchers limitations as a music videocommercial director would hamper the films presentation i was pleasantly surprised that this ended up not being the case apparently he has decided to devolve into that predicted state this film was not a bad idea and the acting was good with what was provided so that leaves us with the presentation being the problem the focus of the film was very disjointed the dialogue was vague and an seemed to try too hard and coming up with the next big quotable and the cinematography was  well  fincher  if youre going to roll a film that is so colorless just make it black and white id love to see them remake this movie with some different direction  there was some real potential in it
