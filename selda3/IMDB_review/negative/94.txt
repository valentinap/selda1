this is one story i was told as a child which is totally destroyed by this movie something told to children by generation of parents totally twisted kiss of true love? no prince no dragon? it seems that nothing in this world is immune to free love movement i do respect everyone but some things should stay as they were whats next snowwhite is kissed by a witch who was always good inside? hansel & gretel were two boys? princess returned glass slipper to cinderella and they lived for ever and ever? on the other side acting effects sound everything is excellent but i do think it should be another story all by itself disney its a shame what you did with this epic story just to be in the flow
