 ill have to admit i was not keen on seeing this movie just because i didnt really enjoy batman begins but i had some hope this movie would be an improvement and it was slightly i did like heath ledgers performance as the joker besides having no back story or anything like that does it deserve an oscar nod not really i think thats mainly out of the fact that he bit the big one earlier this year that and he was supposedly going insane whileor because he was taking on the role so i guess the acting wasnt much of stretch then was it i have to admit the direction wasnt very original or spectacular but besides that the movie was chalked full of big bang boom action scenes the scenes that dealt with dialogue seemed to be trying to make up for the lack of action with cheap humor that wasnt all that funny rachael dawes the most pointless character in the new series what can i say about her other than no one really seemed to care about her or her death the only reason i feel like she returned for this film was to give harvey dent a reason to go nuts and start whacking people which brings me to two face was it necessary to shove that villain into the last part of the movie like a bad subplot i think it wouldve been more appropriate for him to have his own sequel but i guess the writers really didnt think he deserved that i also feel like everything in the movie was so forced together i mean 3 villains in one movie and none of them hardly interact i mean you got scarecrow briefly cameo ing his way into the first little bit of the movie i dont mean to compare the movie to burtons works because thats biasedand screw you because i am but batman returns had all 3 of its bad guys smoothly fit together in the film was it really that hard the last thing i really did not like in the movie was christian bales i must sound like im an 80 year old woman who has cancer and still smokes after 60 something years voice other than those things the movie was okay does it deserve a 97 to be above the likes of pulp fiction alien aliens psycho grindhouse etc not really i think the movie has lost itself in the hype and most of the people who gave it a 10 did so because they didnt understand half the movie but thought it looked cool i think the movie would sit nice with a 6 or 7something rating but thats my opinion anyway i will be not be seeing any more films in this version of the series so you wont hear from me about it again
