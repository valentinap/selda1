heres the bottom line i think there should be an exception for these imdb reviews considering theres really nothing of absolute revelation or a spectacular climax everything you thought of going on in an ordinary persons life that could happen happens thats it again this isnt a spoiler you already knew what happens in this movie before even seeing the trailers trust me youre not missing anything stay home and watch videos of your own family through the years youll be happy you did i will add that if ethan hawke wins the oscar for supporting actor i wouldnt have a problem with it he did do a good job at the role
