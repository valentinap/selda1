ok lookthis movie doesnt deserve one star but it definitely doesnt deserve 10 or even 9 or 8 the only reason i gave this a one star is to even out for all the lemmings that gave it 10 in my humble opinion this movie could fall in the 7 8 range and i would tend to say ok that sounds about right at what point is this movie the masterpiece that deserves 10 stars what makes this movie so innovative and groundbreaking that someone could give it a perfect score just because someone leaves a theater saying wow that movie kicked ass it doesnt mean that it is in the same category with movies like the godfather  star wars  casablanca and other movies that rewrite the beliefs of what great movies are i wouldnt even say that the dark knight is the best movie in the batman franchise much less one of the greatest movies of all time its not even the best batman with the same characters go back and watch batman with michael keaton and jack nickelson and tell me with a straight face that the dark knight is better film and i will be content to know that the world is doomed having said all this the dark knight was watchable and i did enjoy heath ledgers rip role as the joker it is a shame christian bales poor batman character had to spoil it
