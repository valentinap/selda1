how can anyone give this film 1010 ? it lasts for 3 hours and for the first hour nothing happens they could have condensed the first hour to 10 minutes poor plot nasa developing a secret base because the public would not support spending on such expensive waste of money err maybe they would have spotted the dirty great big rocket launching and wonder what it was ?? how about picking the most ridiculous planet that orbits a black hole? you would never be able to develop and further space as anything in orbit had 7 years for every hour on the surface that stupid puddle planet  and the statement that the explorer had just arrived in their time due to relativity ?? err it took 2 years for them to get to jupiter where the wormhole was so assuming they did not leave until they reported back they would have been on the surface for 2 years why cant the transmit back real information  i may have missed that when they can send video messages ? sending back fake data about a planet that is frozen and has ammonia i the air so that it looks good is lame as hell you picked someone to go on a mission through a wormhole alone but they crumble about dying on a frozen planet is stupid anyway you could spot what the planet was like from a long long way to know it was fake hmm turning the robot into a bomb that self destructs ? why ? could they not spot when they landed it was fake? ie a frozen landscape for miles around is not what i would have called a viable planet ahh yes and sending messages back through the wormhole using gravity to encode data in the watch ticking using morse code ????? pathetic i had no joy watching this film except when it went off science fiction this is not
