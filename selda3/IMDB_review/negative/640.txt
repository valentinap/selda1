this movie deliberately deceives you like with a good fraudster there are many positive aspects immaculate acting and visuals positive messages eg there is enormous potential within your self  free it good pacing a nice story twist which seems not to be based on any significant holes in the story line and abundant food for thought all this pales against what appears to be the main and effectively only concern of the movie glorification of a herrenmenschenfascistwomanhatingsadistic type of male homosexuality there is still much to improve in our societies for gay people and this movie does respective efforts not any good to say the least most disturbingly one can observe this tendency in the female lead which is cast as a sex and brainless ragdoll useful only for the release of sexual aggression which she actually likes and deserves because she is a predator posing as a pet  a role model for women in general the final scene does not imply anything else because in the end it is taylor who prevails  as can be inferred by his last splicein
