typically overdirected david fincher nonsenseis he actually able to direct a movie that isnt dank grimy and depressing there are way to many people out there who hold this claptrap in too high regard perhaps they confuse the muddled and selfcongratulatory rubbish that is the plot for something deep and meaningful i found that this film scrapes the bottom of the barrel for reasons to be cynical and faithless it became increasingly obnoxious and irritating edward nortons character had the most annoying voice and the constant ugly imagery turned me off totally if this film wanted to poke fun at our society then why did it only show all the ugly parts granted there is a lot of fake unnatural beauty out there but a helluva lot of this world is still free and nice to look at not everywhere is a dull grey office or a miserable rainy alleyway it is also very very slow 139 minutes have never seemed so longa lot of this film could have been cut out and still there would be no major difference to the story i like the idea that everyone is part of the same gang and by sticking together they can easily bring down modern society this should have been exploited more but we only get about 4 or 5 scenes of their antics but the whole thing of the gang becoming fascists in their attempt to stop fascism is lost on me i didnt find it ironic subtle or meaningful sorry the subtext about man becoming primal again and releasing all the rage created from jobs that insult their intelligence and ruin their lives is lost on me too its practically nonexistent i have never been let down so much by a movie that was hyped as being exciting it was really rather boring the dvd has a loads of features annoying and headache inducing why did fox insist on a dozen little featurettes instead of one healthy hourlong documentary the menus are confusing as is the multiangle function on the 5minute scene deconstructions who on earth is going to watch all of these 2 or 3 times just to see the different angles and bad camcorder shots of someone working on a computer the movie itself is in dolby 51 and is anamorphically enhanced at 2401
