the irony about transcendence is that its all about artificial intelligence but it lacks even the most natural of intelligence completely though it starts with a big promise of strong things to come it falls weak and on its knees so fast that once its done you realize that depp has taken you on a joy ride i cannot exactly say if its an entire waste of 120 minutes of your life but it sure does not add any more value to it transcendence looks like the big budget disaster of 2014 so far which the crown held by after earth last year for some its would be ok to argue that the movie was too complicated and its only for the thinkers but in my point of view thinking too much about this would only makes you feel sorry for doing it when will caster johnny depp who is a renowned scientist in artificial intelligence dies his wife uploads his consciousness to a program expecting that his great knowledge can be harvested for future as expected wills consciousness perform brilliantly but evolves in to a greater power and a threat than being an asset and when he breaks the barriers of nano technology he starts to play god the plot clearly has lot of potential but its not something groundbreaking or never heard of before therefore transcendence is already decades late but tries hard to be futuristic but still it could have being save it if didnt have some obvious mistakes there are so many plot holes that make it completely unjustifiable and qualify to be an effective science fiction or a drama if wish to continue to the end you have to completely withdraw yourself from them and go along but its something not very easy to do i dont want to give out any spoilers but keeping the ai part and the nano part aside as they are fictional the stuff that actually happens right now are depicted in a complete bogus manner here how the story flows and the events taken place is far from its narrative and you cant really forgive it seems like the cast is a way to salvage it but to be honest nor depp or morgan has a strong part to perform so their appearance is a waste the fans of both will only end up disappointed and there are some poor looking action scenes that pop up time to time and even that make little sense the cg is not brilliant and cinematography is mundane but the hope of the big cast and the plot i somehow went through the whole movie
