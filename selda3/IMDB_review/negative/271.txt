let me start by saying im certain i would more than struggle to make a better film i am humbled by the energy love and devotion required to produce the few moments that literally flash before our eyes i also consider myself a huge fan of the nolan brothers following memento the prestige inception all films of exceptional quality and fantastic storytelling for years christopher nolan has worked literal movie magic telling his audience exactly what to expect from the very beginning yet delivering a performance that leaves them no less than astounded interstellar begins no different nolan practically hands the ending to the audience leaving little to surprise but unlike previous masterpieces interstellar drags the audience on a painful bumpy ride through space time love and death leaving some in hypnotic wonder the rest simply insulted wishing for nothing more than to get back the past 169 minutes stay a message delivered by cooper to his daughter across space and time and yes we knew it was him all along stay the message potential viewers should hear loud and clear stay home its safe and warm revisit memento the prestige or inception and marvel at the layered depth of stories told so well you ache for them to be told again and again and again perhaps next time the nolans will deliver on that hope until then stay away from interstellar
