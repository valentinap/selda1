man fellowship was much better than this piece of junk a lot of the shots were horrible the cgi except for gollum sucked the dialogue was beyond cheesy the battles were anti climatic the way the war ended w the dead people was dumb the ending dragged on and on and on i checked my watch at least 15 times during this movie the battle scenes blah and if the fate of the world is in your hands and your supposedly out numbered why freakin joke while your fighting and putting notches on your belt thats just so freakin lame the attempts at comedy in this movie were laughable if you want to watch a movie w real battle scenes do yourself a favor and go see last samurai ive seen that movie 2 times and im going to have to see it again to get the bad taste out of my mouth that is rotk
