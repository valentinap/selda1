this movie fails to show why a remake was necessary it fails to bring the morals of the old movie into the modern world and it fails to develop the characters overall it also shows a disappointing amount of visual inconsistency just to promote one hollywood star the femalefemalerelationship as central point rather than the male femalerelationship is nothing new since frozen in fact prince philip who is even more onedimensional than his cartoonversion is still there at the end to be the one and only considering how easy this film avoids any conversational aspects between auroras real parents and adoptive parents just shows that plot development and modern problems were not what the writers thought about auroras mother dies offscreen and nobody not her husband not her daughter ever seem to take any notice just to avoid any problems between the two mother figures in this movie not only the queen and the young prince are loosing screentime and depth the three good fairies in the original had personalities while they are now only a bunch of annoying and incompetent additions for the sake of obvious humor the third fairy never actually was able to give her wish the movie never explains this plot whole maleficent is a movie starring a cartoonist version of angelina jolie in a movie about angelina jolie no character apart from her has been developed with any love or thought they are all background for more angelina jolie overall i am deeply disappointed if you compare the old sleeping beauty with the new movie you can see the disney tendency to go from timeless movies to something that looks great but communicates nothing dont watch it with your children they will not learn more than what they can get from the old movies dont watch it for the sake of nostalgia because its unable to provide the same quality it used to before 3d was able to overcome any plot wholes and dont watch it for the sake of crafty 3d the same expected shots of flying sunsets and growing plants are used over and over again you will get tired of seeing the same overly perfect shot repetitively
