 not the strongest of the trilogy a lengthy drawn out conclusion it lacks the heart of the previous two and lapses on awkwardly with trivial and extraneous characters while he focus obviously should have been elsewhere i especially despised that tacky girlpower bit just goes to show directors actually can drag out irrelevant tacked on plot pieces and the ignorant hordes call it epic because hey its really longyou can pee 3 times get popcorn and soda refillsanswer your pagerand not miss anything most of the dialog is redundant expectancies of the end its got to end right however tediously and it is tedious with proper editing this movie could have been condensed into an hour butguess what the whole trilogys been padded so extensively for length so you can pay to see 3 not just 2 filmsits most obvious in this one wow this passes for classic
