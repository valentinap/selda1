remakes are regular things nowadays but carbon copies are rare this is a lift in terms of dialogue shots almost everything at times the big question is why? as a film in its own right its not terrible but comparing it to the original it literally pales in comparison despite being a liveaction rip why did we need this _ sure on some level it may reach those who havent seen the original and dont want to watch an old anime but really _ why should we indulge the multiplexers who refuse to watch anything made before 2005? its not bad _ its poor a poor relation of the original in the uk we often get 50th anniversary etc rereleases of old films nationwide admittedly not in all cinemas in fact cinderella monogatari was out a few years ago so the idea that a cheap copy is good because itll help open it up to new audiences the cast are all ok _ until you watch the original anime overall its soso as a film however when you compare it to the original its really a poor show and because its a carbon copy you cant help but compare it line for line scene for scene actor for actor
