shawshank is by far the most grossly overrated films of all time to say that this is better than lawrence of arabia better than alien better then saving private ryan is just ridiculous this movie is weak as are all the characters in it ill never forgot the scene where the old man hangs himself after leaving prison and the piano symphony kicks in why should i feel sorry for him try living in africa buddy and tell me how hard your life is this movie is for weak people who love to shed a tear for prisoners and overall just weak people now i love the director of this and stephen king but im sorry this isnt a masterpiece its forcing the audience into the characters emotional problems that few can relate go see the green mile instead rating = d videogamehollywoodcom
