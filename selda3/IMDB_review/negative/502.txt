cinema visitors seeing the good rating and reviews on imdb beware i am a big fan of fantasy movies but first of all the 16+ rating is not truly understandable for me its a children and family movie and so i have to confess i may be to hard on the movie because i went in there with to high expectations the look may be good and the vfx are also high quality production but the story just lacks on depth the idea to show the beginning of evil and the fairy tale world from another point of view is good but the script and the acting was really bad imo angelina could have done better and some very flat character drawings and dialogs let me roll my eyes unconsciously the movie had some funny moments though but they are rare and for this idea there should have been more time for preproduction sometimes and most of all in the beginning it seems like a fastforward story where every important story point is just streaked with the cautiousness of a metal glove its what i would call a sunday afternoon movie where you can lay on the couch and just let it pass but its nothing what really attracted me for my 3 female friends it was entertaining but they also told me that it was nothing special and they would not really recommend it to other friends they just described it as a nice if there are no expectations and you want to make your 4 to 12 year old child happy with a nice movie you should sit in there seeing angelina in the role was interesting but now i know its not her kind of genre
