the dustbowli didnt understand the usage of old interview footage from survivors of the early dustbowls made no sense corn is the only viable crop? okay i didnt get the whole antiscience apollo faked landings schtick it was irrelevant to the plot in fact the plot points out that science is mans only hope here why indeed have our future selves placed a wormhole next to saturn and not the moon where its more convenient? why cant our future selves if they are so advanced simply contact us directly or show up? why cant they appear in the past when it wasnt too late to save the planet? what was the deal with the barely habitable planets of ice and water and rocks? earth is a jewel yet these places wouldnt support any human populations and indeed they even pale to the dustbowl earth depicted in the movie how is it that weve got advanced enough technologies for ai robots and blackhole venturing spacecraft but we cant save the earth? enters a black hole enters a tesseract of space time and the best he can do is ping a watchs second hand? back to my comment about our future selves right theres only one thing thats rewarding in this movie and its the rather recycled but still fun to watch aspects of the various launches and spacecraft operation yay unfortunately this is a grand total of about 5 minutes of footage the sound in this movie is impressive but at several points it overwhelms the lame dialogue
