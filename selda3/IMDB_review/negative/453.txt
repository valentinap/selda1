i am not a huge fan of blockbusters so maybe i am not the target audience of this movie but i do enjoy them from time to time but this movie was a huge disappointment and frankly it was one of the worst mainstream movies i have seen in cinemas granted i have not seen many movies in cinemas in recent years it reminded me of another movie which i consider as one of my least favourite movies wanted to be honest there are many elements of that movie that have been used in this movie and frankly it seemed like a partial remake of that one the first problem was maybe colin firth i thought he was so incredibly miscast it seemed awkward to see him do the church fight and the fight with the thugs he was saying such corny annoying lines which would not seem out of place in one of those bollywood movies where the hero is all powerful even in comparison those movies at least seem more original many of the characters reminded me of many older movies the same old rough kid being trained to fight story has been done over and over again the whole banter between the posh guys and eggsy is cringeworthy the lead actor who played the role of eggsy has zero presence and is pretty much forgettable he really doesnt have the look for such a role i guess also this movie was mostly supposed to be funny but most of the humor elements fall absolutely flat what was the point of the head explosions? that was absolutely the worst scene that i have seen in cinemas in recent years i expected something much more substantial and believable but that really disappointed me the church fight was also stupid and meaningless just meaningless violence but without the beauty of john woo or even movies like the matrix the whole movie is so cynically geared to getting a reaction from teenage boys i am just surprised that there was no eye candy pretty much throughout the movie sure there were women but there are no suggestive sexual scenes maybe that last one in the end and another thing that i disliked was the use of classic rock music like freebird it seemed like an insult to this song to be associated with such tripe now lastly the presence of samuel jackson didnt really elevate the movie much he does better than the other actors but as far as i can remember he doesnt really have many memorable lines or scenes in this movie but i am thankful he is involved in the movie since that made it a little bearable for me and i was able to finish it there are just too much unbelievable fight scenes and ridiculous things like head explosions which have been done more realistically by tom savini in low budget 80s movies church fights and so on i know my rating is a little harsh since samuel jackson is not so bad but i am just rating as far as my personal experience is concerned 310
