with what seems like a million different versions of this classic fairytale you would think disney would go all out and make this one new and exciting but still keep the core parts the same however what you get is a very outdated movie with acting that is mediocre at best the only part i found interesting and enjoyable on film is when the fairy godmother played by helena carter shows up and does her thing turning the pumpkin into a carriage etc the animated version will always be the best but i dont think even young girls will be able to enjoy this just way too dull and it felt like an eternity
