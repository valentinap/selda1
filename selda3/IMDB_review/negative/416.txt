i had high hopes for this film i am sorry to say interstellar was the worst film i have seen in a long time i have seen many terrible films but none have compelled me to ever write a review of what i thought there is too many things that make this film and i am not going to rant along here i just wanted to say if i could rate this film 01 out of 10 i would plot holes complete disregard for science bad acting better special effects and spacecraft motion physics have been seen in thunderbird puppets storyline has no clue where it is going and many more i would put this film in childrens fantasy category rather than science fiction
