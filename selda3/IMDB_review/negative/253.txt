matthew m mumbles and mumbles no idea what hes on about mm is miscast we need someone who is audible and attractive its dusty but the dust doesnt settle on the corn no dust cloud follows the pickup as they plough through the cornfield chasing a drone this is a totally unexplained encounter the family are so busy watching the drone that they nearly drive over a cliff even though they are on their own land perhaps because they are driving the pickup blind yet fast enough to keep up with a jetpowered drone hello??? no intelligible explanation for how mm landed the drone what he found in it how a groovy pile of dust helped him find the space station nor why they hired him to fly the mission why should michael caine be the nasa project director  he is hardly an obvious rocket scientist why such a bizarre robot? and did it wake them all up before the worm hole  or did i miss how that was to happen in the mumbles lo and behold  despite having travelled for months to the wormhole end near saturn they find themselves right beside a suitable planet at the other end but i guess that was the work of them it is key to the plot but there is no scientific concept that would make 1 hour on a planet into 7 years and how come the open sea is paddleable and a vast tsunami appears? despite the size of the waves all is immediately calm and they seem to be predictable stuck some equally improbable idea was going to solve this problem but id lost interest it is the moment i walked out the movie to that point was uninteresting and wholly illogical i really thought with all the hype it would be compelling instead it was plain irritating anne hathaway was okay at least we could hear what she was saying and we could hear everyone else for that matter poor miscast good ol boy matthew i have now read the wikipedia synopsis which is likewise unintelligible and am hugely glad that i left  even though i have wasted one hour of the two hours i saved by writing this review
