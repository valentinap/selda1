this is my first review and i am compelled to write it t counter all the 10 star ratings this is possibly the worst movie ever made i fell asleep several times and would have left had i not been sitting in the middle of the row of seats i wanted to ask for my money back at the end of the film its just boring and nonsensical why is every actor in the movie crying all the time? why does mm mumblewhisper all his lines? i felt no emotional connection to any of the characters and didnt care if they lived or died i heard this was an amazing movie and was looking forward to seeing it but the only thing amazing about it is how much money and talent was turned into such a big steaming pile of dog excrement
