now before i start i must first say i am no huge fan of the batman films and i have never seen batman begins however after going to the cinemas to watch this film i was surprised how good it is i mean the joker did the best acting there was and he was kind of funny however im afraid that was the only guy that did amazing christian bale did very good and im looking forward to his next film terminator 4 salvation however i thought his deep voice in tdn was a little badwhy did it have to be so bad of a voice anyway forget the voice its a good film but for the time it lasts 2 30 hours it could of been shorter and just as good but yeah 7 10 i recommend this film to anyone however it isnt one of my favourites why so serious
