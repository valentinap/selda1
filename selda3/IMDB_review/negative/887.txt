okay gandalf aragorn frodo are killed in the first ten minutes and sauron is king again that would be a good ending but no it drags on for another 3 hours and in the end everything is well and all goals are reached in between there are many fighting scenes where you easely get confused who is fighting against who and what exactly for the fighting is overdone and in all battles the good guys win boring and predictable the strongest warrior of the bad guys is defeated by an average female warrior it could do with some more drama it is evident from all 3 movies together that its a story about the eternal fight between good and bad but in these movies its never really explained why exactly the bad guys hate the good guys whats even more disturbing is the facial features of the bad vs the groomed faces of the good guys as if the storyline itself simply wasnt strong enough to outline that they are really evil the orcs have disfigured faces disfigured teeth drool and have a hissing voice couldnt jackon portray that a little bit more subtile frodo is attacked by a giant spider who has surprise surprise also a deformed face and only one eye on the left side of the head is this done to make sure 3 year old infants cannot mistake who is the scary bad guy it was ridiculous to see in fact i had trouble hating them at all i just felt sorry for them i understand its a family movie but this blatant deforming is an insult to the intelligence of people then theres the plot and the story it doesnt make any sense theres no explanation why faramir father wants to kill himself and his son or why gandalf or aragorn do not take the ring to mordor but trust it to little frodo who does nothing but squeel cry and hug sam in between why did the fellowship decide to break up and let frodo continue alone with sam while the other stronger fellows try to save peppin and merrin on with this movie gandalf and aragorn guess frodo must be close to his end goal in mordor but is held up by saurons watching eye so decide to launch a distracting attack with the last army the good guys have left what if frodo happened to appear a few hours later or a few days and sauron itself was a huge warrior in movie 1 but now only a flame on a tower why do the thousands of orcs stop fighting when the tower crumble they flee but where to it is just too unbelievable stupid in movie one thousands of orc chase the fellowship in moria only inches away but none of them harm frodo or manage to catch them in movie 2 they ride with 5 horses through 10000 orcs without so much as a scratch in movie 3 gandalf fights the orcs in mordor but suddenly stops for a moment of musing and while the fighting around him continues not an orc touches him or buries his sword in gandalfs white hair ive seen c class horrors that made more sense then theres the last 20 minutes frodo destroyed the ring but the end simply goes on and on and on and on lots of tear jerking twists appear and you simply start shouting please end to the tv screen in utter annoyance no this movie may have won all academy awards it was nominated for but it was a terrible terrible series the thing that saved this last part a little bit was the helicopter view scenery but if i wanna watch helicopter view scenery ill watch national geographic even the epic battles gave me a feeling of been there done that star wars gladiator ben hur they all done the same and most of the time better shot directed edited and more importantly more believable and the directing was awful the cinematography boring and predictable the editing confusing the score predictable the storyline infantile the acting without any exception terrible the lenght insane the events too much for fantasy the cgi effects hokey it is a childs movie a la jungle book it belongs on nickelodeon between spongebob and johnny bravo in fact there oughta be a law against peter jackson movies i said borefest in the summary but that was too kind its a nice series when you are a child but its outright trash if youre an adult the one aspect that made this one better than the other 2 movies is that there is finally and end to the endless walking and talking the ring is destroyed peter jacksons mega project too thankfully
