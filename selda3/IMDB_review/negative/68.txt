this movie started out slow but had a typical predictable storyline untilcolin firths character went on a psychotic killing spree and literally killed an entire church full of people singlehandedly the violence was beyond gruesome poles being shoved up underneath peoples chins into their heads stabbings shootings anything you can think of i havent wanted to walk out of a movie more fast than this one but i stuck it out because i was with someone else and figured it couldnt get any worse wrong next thing you know there are microchips overheating and making hundreds of peoples heads explode all to music it was horrendous but wait theres more lets not forget the useless show of a bare a$$ of some princess who wants to thank the teenager for saving the day and let him mount her sexist much? are you effing kidding me? i want my money back
