actually a good well acted movie till the end ben affleck was excellent and rosamund pike had me 100% convinced she was evil incarnate carrie coon as bens twin sister and kim dickens as the lead detective also gave excellent performances as for the story i can deal with sad endings where the hero dies like braveheart cool hand luke and endless others when the credits came up on gone girl i could only regret spending over 2 hrs to watch a movie that left me that angry i would have preferred she had just killed ben affleck and gotten away with it assuming the book had the same ending i would have thrown it across the room upon finishing it i enjoyed the movie up till the end but that completely ruined it for me
