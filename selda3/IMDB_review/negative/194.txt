seldom has there been a film where the critics opinions and its true quality diverge so seriously boyhood is empty because it lacks content and form it celebrates the ordinary and mediocrity instead of aiming at something extraordinary as a result it embraces nothingness and is in that sense deeply nihilistic and even depressing anybody with the same camera and some actors could have made this movie or more likely a better one those who praise the film always point out the same circumstance the only thing they can say which is this film is like real life i have to say this is true on the most superficial level imaginable but i may ask is that a good thing? is this if film history has taught us anything what a film should be? real life according to linklater means a lifespan during which nothing happens the boyhoodexperience is the equivalent of your experience waiting in line at the supermarket yes this is the real life linklater presents us nothing happens in this movie nothing no story no interesting characters just ordinary situations from real life of course there are films in which nothing or very little happens and they can be great tarkovskys mirror antonionis lavventura or tarrs the turin horse come to my mind but you need ideas you got that linklater? you need a style or form which cannot be separated from the content you need a capable director that can create a form of visual communication boyhood offers none of those things the film gets praised especially by those who have never seen an arthouse movie and mistake it for an art film people are misled so easily boyhood is pure blankness shallowness superficiality nothingness to praise boyhood as a masterpiece is actually a slap in the face of all those directors who put a real effort into creating works of art that have real value boyhood is in fact an antifilm in the sense that it stands against everything film should be  be it an artistic masterpiece or just an entertaining fun movie the film is neither a work of art nor entertaining in that regard it can be called a nonfilm it celebrates its own nonexistence and drowns in its nihilism i doubt this was linklaters intention but it certainly is the result of what he created be warned this is not a drama the movie is the opposite of a carefully constructed work of art its nothing but a reenactment of memories a collection of unmeaning scenes we may or may not know from our own lives bowling playing video games reading harry potter etc i think it is only fair to ask what is the point? i went to see this film having high hopes and having read all the raving reviews expecting a masterpiece from richard linklater the director of the great waking life i liked the trailer which makes the movie look much more interesting than it actually is actually everything that happens in the movie is already in the trailer the basic idea of filming a boy growing into a young man during twelve years is interesting yes but sadly the film offers nothing more than that this is not enough sadly many critics seem to have liked the basic idea so much that to them it didnt even matter if the director would be able to make it interesting or not the film which is much too long follows an unstable family and focuses on the life of mason a character that has absolutely no interesting characteristics whatsoever the intelligent viewer will be unable to connect with such a person mason walks through this film as if he was in a coma or half asleep he has no ambitions at some point he gets his first kiss gets interested in photography the ultimate art form for unimaginative lazy people during high school havent we seen that already too many times? goes to college at which point the film ends i kid you not this is the whole movie the mother becomes a teacher at a local college and always seems to attract the wrong guys the father is an unemployed loser who only talks about pop music and ends up being a square masons sister the directors daughter grows up too and thats pretty much all you can say about her it is actually impossible to spoil this film because nothing happens unless you consider the fact that mason finishes high school a spoiler linklater completely fails to dramatize his ideas as a result following this movie feels like watching family home videos of a family you do not care about  just with better picture quality instead of using form or contentdrama to make the film interesting boyhood refuses to do just that and therefore remains superficial you dont get to the essence of real life by only showing the surface of things everybody could do that it is really hard talking about this film because there isnt a single interesting character or scene in it you just follow ordinary events in the lives of these people stay away from this movie yes this review will get negative votes just because i didnt like the film unlike the critics union well none of those critics were able to offer a single insightful argument that would speak for this nonmovie in fact many even admitted the film lacked interesting characters or style but because of the 12yeargimmik they call it a masterpiece give me a break i would be willing to debate any of these pseudointelligent critics and tear them into pieces over and out
