a typical nutsandbolts storyline that hollywood is sooooo comfortable with ye ole agent that has outlived his usefulness so its time to retire them permanently practice anyone who has followed the equalizer eye spy or the original series from which this film is based is certainly not unfamiliar with the plot add to this some nifty special effects and gadgetry and youve got a time worn plot with a new wrapping of course throw in the usual percentage of spy idioms too the team does a job then proceeds to get knocked off except for tom cruise toms out there and alone tom desperately tries to contact the company tom is scared tom forgot his dental floss see tom run tom cant even manage a goofy smile they try to kill tom toms having a bad hair day what happens for the rest of this flick is a whirlwind of incredible improbability and a seething lack of tension inbetween muffled protests of no way and the physical sense of my eyelids getting heavy mission impossible is about as suspenseful as watching a plumber unclog a drain ms redgraves performance is little more than a cameo which is a true waste of a gifted actress in summation when the best thing you can say about a motion picture is that the peppy theme song recycled from the tv series still sounds good its time to fold the tent
