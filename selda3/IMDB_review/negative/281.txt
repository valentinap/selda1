just could not believe nolan would have created this junk i could hardly see any action sequence and all i get to see is a family melodrama in the name of a scifi movie the plot is good but the movie clearly missed the direction it needed well the concept of space travel gravity wormhole blackhole all looks good in books to know more about it i would have read the brief history of time again or watched more documents on the theory of relativity or blackholes but to bring it out in reality one has to really evolve a lovely plot which was definitely missing in this movie if it was any other director i would have give it a 5 star but i have always looked upon nolan in the leagues of spielberg james cameron or guy ritchie so for all the great expectations and the disappointment all i could give is 1 star sorry nolan half the theater was empty by the time 1 hr flew and i had a take a short nap while the movie was running at a slow pace
