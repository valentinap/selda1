 i had such high hopes when i first heard that a tolkien fan was going to write and direct a live action+cgi version of lord of the rings only to have them cruelly dashed fotr was a bit rough but i said to myself itll only get better boy was i wrong i suppose the main problem is twofold first jackson is way too young inexperienced to have taken on this project he certain has ability but he has a lot to learn about filmmaking before even thinking about tackling such an ambitious project second for alleged lovers of the source material jackson and company took way too many liberties with the story changing them in pointless and even foolish ways perhaps this was inexperience maybe it was just laziness or a lack of understanding of the source material goodness knows that lotr is far from perfect as an example of storytelling but there is a great tale buried in tolkiens massive tome too bad that jackson and his crew were absolutely unable to bring it to the screen by the trotk jacksons exhaustion is practically oozing from the screen and hes lost sight of many key elements of the story
