there box in the book i dont why it was even in there i just added more confusion next her hair cut was awful  i know fault in our stars she couldve kept the wig from the beginning of the movie next they barely include side characters  christina hector etc  dont expect anything from the book jeanine doesnt get killed by evelyn but by tori what is sad is that peter and eric were my actors then all start randomly running towards the fence after as if they are all gonna get out  which doesnt happen  then the jeanines army randomly go in amity in the beginning with barely any marcus evelyn standing on the side stalking four  it is a good movie if u havent read the book but if u reach the book you are screwed
