this was the best script they could come up with? this was the best idea on the shelf for the backstory for one of the greatest villains? i am appalled strombergs direction was deplorable it was like watching the phantom menace it just made so little sense that i was forced to stifle laughter but failed then they threw in creatures stolen from every creative fantasy artist in the last 40 years and made the world as pretty as avitar i saw nothing new here nothing but money and an exploited fan base maleficent was an amazing villain and this destroyed that wtfg disney you are the george lucas of fairy tales destroying your own creations i will torrent this film when the riff trax boys riff it the least i can do to recoup the money i feel was swindled from me
