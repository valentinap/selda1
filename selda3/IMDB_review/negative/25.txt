what a huge pile of steaming poop i could not believe that the movie critics gave this horrible movie a 92 rating the movie is slow as hell the characters are so badly developed that you never care for them good actors play characters that appear in the movie juts to be disposed off soon after the special effects are pretty weak you see the spaceship vibrating all the time but the faces of the actors are not reflecting the shaking or the gravitational pulls but of course they make lots of ugly faces you should see the movie stealth to learn a thing or two about this kind of special effects the robot is the most ridiculous thing in the movie the plot is just so far fetched that i caught myself smiling at times who let the writer into the cutting room? 3 hours are you serious? only an unabashed christopher nolan fanboy would have the courage to claim to have found any redeeming quality on this practical joke $20000000000 us dollars what a waist
