like many others i was shocked by how bad this movie was and the many plot holes its hard to know where to startamy being sent home from the hospital still covered in blood was one low point i also agree with the earlier reviewer who says the movie is antifemale empowerment it makes the commentators on tv talking about domestic violence seem like the enemybecause you know at that point the husband is wrongly accused so you see the women talking about husbands murdering wives on the pseudonancy grace talk show as false accusers and man haters very disturbing however i wrote this review to point out one plot hole one very big plot hole nobody else seemed to notice again spoiler here amy is a psychopath supposedly the whole story turns on the idea that she is sociopathic and abusive and has been for years witness her framing of the exboyfriend 8 years earlier why then does she givelend her parents almost her entire trust fund simply because they ask? it is already established that they care more for fictional amazing amy than for her her reason at the end of the day the trust fund is really their money huh? thats how a psychopath sociopath thinks about parents she doesnt like? or was it part of her evil plan all along to end up broke in missouri so she could start to hate her husband and try to frame him? sarcasm its just dumb how did this movie and book get such great buzz? i left the movie wondering sadly is this what people like now? btw i watched this with a largely college age audience who laughed several times especially when amy flips her nonbloodsoaked blond hair at the end of the bloody murder scene at then laughed again when the credits were rolling
