i am sick and tired of hollywoods inaccuracies in the films they produce from amistads horrendous lies about its stories of slavery to tyler perry making me believe that he is an actual elderly black woman hollywood keeps pooping out new flicks that focus entirely on the entertainment and not at all on the facts and its safe to say that boyhood was the worst of all this movie made me so livid that i wanted to cut my freaking cats ear off the film portrayed a boy as he grew from five to seventeen years old in front of the audiences eyes he lived in a mostly happy household with only a few minor obstacles but nothing too severe that the family couldnt handle it except that one part the people who have viewed the film will know what part i mean boyhood did not represent childhood in a realistic way and it especially did not represent my childhood i was born in a small town in nebraska on the dance floor of a strip club off the interstate where my mom happened to be dancing that night many people took their dollars back off the stage the moment i popped out i emerged from my mothers uterus with a feeling of ambition a feeling that i could take the world by storm however my father a flight attendant had other plans for me once i got my basic motor movements down he had me training to be just like your old man as he put it pops made me train for hours on end serving drinks and peanuts to family friends and relatives while always keeping a phony smile on my face by the age of three i knew the safety procedure speech like the back of my hand and keep in mind this was before i even knew the alphabet or my own name all i ever wanted to do was juggle for a living i once told him about my desire to attend juggling camp for a week over the summer he replied by saying i bet youd like to handle all those balls wouldnt you? stick to flight attending son its a mans job i was devastated the idea of being able to keep more than one ball in the air at a time mesmerized me for years to come but i could never make my dreams known for fear of what my father might do once i graduated from high school my dad pulled some strings and got me a job as a flight attendant at the nearest airport he had retired at this point he said he did it because 911 really sucked balls he was so excited that i was following or should i say flying in his footsteps but the day i was supposed to start the job i did not make it to the airport for i was on my way to follow my dreams i hit the open road looking for the nearest juggling college the existential feeling of bliss that i felt from the freedom of being out of my fathers control was more than i had ever felt before but it quickly diminished for i learned that there is no such thing as juggling college amateur mistake blake amateur mistake i ran out of money fast having spent it all on an expensive juggling set i had planned on showing off to all the other kids at juggling college so that i could be one of the cool kids i hooked for a little bit but no one would take my body i have a bad hunching problem and a massive rash on my back so it kind of looks like molten lava rushing down the side of a volcano when i take my shirt off i had nowhere to go no one to turn to for many a days i ate garbage from a dumpster behind burger king which i know sounds redundant since their food is already garbage i got food poisoning thrice over the course of a year reluctantly i knew what i had to do i tucked my tail in between my legs and made the long journey home back to my parents i knocked on the door and asked my dad for forgiveness no son of mine will be a juggler not on my watch he yelled but dad i pleaded you are forever shunned from this household he said with an icy look then he slammed the door in my weary face i am still homeless i have no money and nowhere to go i recently beat a man with one of my expensive juggling pins in a fight over a box of raisin bran its brutal out there let me tell you i figured out this family was going on vacation for a couple weeks so i am currently squatting in their home i came to see boyhood because i rented it on their credit card and i am also stealing their internet to write this review i just needed to get my thoughts on how unrealistic boyhood was out in the open because i checked and i didnt see anyone else complaining about this i mean cmon hollywood where was the part about flight attendants? where were the parts about the boys love for juggling and his dads denial of any pursuit of the boys dreams? huh????? because tell me if im wrong but i didnt catch those parts it really baffles me how well you hollywood bigwigs botched this great idea for a movie call me when you make a good movie for once im done with this bs ps dont call me because i dont own a phone because im homeless because my dad shunned me for my love of juggling sincerely your fellow imdb user blakelogsdon1
