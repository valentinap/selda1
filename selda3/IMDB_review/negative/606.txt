i went to see this with a friend because id heard it was good at the local imax theater no less i went in with absolutely no knowledge on it whatsoever once i actually saw it i realized it was one of the worst movies ive ever seen and ive seen some real stinkers id rather have my eyelids held open by toothpicks while tied to a chair in front of a screen showing a back to back ed wood marathon i cant think of a single thing i enjoyed about fight club what there is of a plot is all over the place the lines are beyond cringeworthy its way too preachy and the plot twist at the end manages to veer off way past the range of strange into the range of bat crazy the secret longing of men is to beat each other up in basements and blow up buildings who knew much like the fights theres no subtlety in the plots yeah yeah materialism is bad were not what we own blah blah blah did we really need that pounded into our skulls for almost 2 hours if you feel like youre in a rat race and you hate your job then quit and find something to do thats more worthwhile to you i could hardly believe that was brad pitt his performances in 12 monkeys and se7en were far superior to this trashy flick is fincher incapable of making a movie that doesnt look like the lenses have been sprayed with campbells beef broth the cinematography is choppy and theres only so much i can take of random dudes beating the snot out of each other for no reason they should have used some of that soap to clean up the film from me 1 star
