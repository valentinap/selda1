the red coats are coming the red coats are coming once again the english is trying to invade the land of the free imdb i apologize for not believing those who warned me of this movie people actually walked out i very much wanted to however i was with a friend he apparently wanted out as well being respectful of each other did not say anything till we discussed the movie which took about 2 seconds movie is hollow there is no beginning and most important there is no end batmans voice was annoying heath was okay especially with his disappearing trick oh yes one person clapped at the end i wanted to jump down and beat the hell out of him then realized he was slapping his head for it went numb for those who dont believe the negative ratings i want you to go watch it
