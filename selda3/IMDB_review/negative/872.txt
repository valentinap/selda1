 im giving this movie a number one not so much thats it awful but that its completely over rated you people on here need to get a grip with reality it makes me sick to see how out of hand everyone here has become with the death of heath ledger i come across many fans of heath ledger who tell me how great he is this movie and how he was so talented and how they were huge fans oddly not anyone can tell me that they have seen candy or much less even heard of it candy is i feel heath ledgers best role so for all you fans of heath ledger i recommend you take a look see at that one look the dark knight is a good movie but better than the godfather it will never be no matter how many 10s you give this movie
