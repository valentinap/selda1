when i saw this was directed by chris nolan i said theres no way i can miss this movie then i checked out the ratings on imdb and went running to the theater only to be put to sleep this movie was supposed to take place a few centuries into the future however when cooper goes to his daughters school for the parent teacher conference there is a tube tv in the classroom huh? tube tvs cant be found anywhere in 2014 yet were expected to believe they exist 200 years in the future also what was the point of cooper and the kids following that drone? they made a huge climatic event and then the drone crashes and thats it ok so whats the point going through the worm hole was ok but the other planets that were visited looked down right fantastical like out of a disney fairytale this film was filled with a listers but fell flat matt damons character was totally predictable and so was the ending i really dont understand the appeal and high ratings
