the name of the movie couldnt be better mission impossible because it was impossible of watching this is a very boring action film i hoped something better because the 2 tv series the nineties one and the sixties one were two great tv series but this movie man it was boring as hell i dont know how i didnt fall sleep in the middle of the movie it could be more boring? tom cruise in one of his worst performances not only him everyone in the movie were so lame the plot itself have no sense so this is my review one of the most boring films i have seen in my life i give it 110
