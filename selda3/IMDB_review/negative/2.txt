wow talk about the most misrepresented show on television arrow purports to be an actionadventure show about a superhero in reality it is as far from that as possible the movie annie has more action and adventure than arrow if this show has been recommended to you then i hope you are a fan of melodrama i call this show arrow 90210 taking out the commercials you are left with about 35 mins of tiresomely boring melodrama between the relatives and friends of arrow and about 5 mins of action i was really excited to watch this show i am a fan of the comic book and i liked the proposed changes to make the character more modern when i saw the pilot i thought it was interesting the whole subplot no spoilers in this review was intriguing and the show overall was interesting i did find the central character a bit lacking in the acting department is that guy a robot? have they updated his emotional responses yet? and the drama between the family and friends overly long and tiresome i still thought it had potential much to my chagrin the tiresome drama was quickly extended through each episode and the subplot and action downgraded accordingly by the fourth episode i was bored i turned it off i absolutely could not watch any further i found that i didnt care at all about the feelings or relationships of the characters and if the villain ever showed up dont blink or youll miss him i was rooting for him to win
