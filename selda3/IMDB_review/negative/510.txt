boring boring boring boring i wish i could fill up this review with just that one word but imdb wont let me how can anyone sit through 2 34 hours of watching someones boring life roll by? what a waste of film  or is it all video tape now? i dont care how long a film took to make how the actors aged over the course of the film or anything else i want a film to tell a story and this is more like watching someones boring life as they grow up so what? who wants to watch that? what is it with all these people who think that is marvelous they really must have incredibly boring lives to think that this film is even the remotest bit interesting this film is almost as bad as birdman which i watched completely thinking that at some point something interesting must happen but it didnt just some artyfarty long camera shots whoopdeedoo and this one was filmed over 12 years? whoopdeedoo
