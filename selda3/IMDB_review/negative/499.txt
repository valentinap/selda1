cons i hated how the actor for cinderella looked her eyebrows bothered me throughout the whole movieshe wasnt a true blond had a fat jaw small eyes larger nose and bluntly just not gorgeous cinderella was supposed to be pretty with all small facial features except for big blue eyes her eyes were not even bluetheres plenty of beautiful blonde actors like amanda seyfried amber laura heardanna sophia robbchlo« grace moretzindiana rose evansand her not having her hair in a bun with earing and gloves really just helped destroy the whole cinderella look the step sisters were supposed to be overweight and ugly but both were skinny and one pretty the child cinderella had buck teeth and a big nose and forehead too and wasnt too pretty either theres the step mom didnt seem so evil more hurt and greedy but not consistent with either the movie wasnt too exciting or dramatizedpros the change in how she got her name was great her being couragous and kind was good the men that actually looked like a goose and lizards was great the carriage blue dress and glass slipper was magical the price was perfectthe real mom was perfect and beautiful the acting from most actors was goodthe moral of the story was better and last but not least disney make a movie with a hispanic girl theres mostly white princess and only a few non white that are never displayed on shirts and etc except for the occasional black princess to shut people up
