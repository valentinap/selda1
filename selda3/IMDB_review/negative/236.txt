oh lord where art thou€? well let me start with this i was thinking of many different titles for my little essay most of which were either political incorrect or simply too plain to use but still just a few what happened? or oh my balls or the peak of feminism or the extinction of mankind€etc so the point is that the story we all know well from our childhood got so many twists that you can easily forget it and look into the world of a totally other tale the evil fairy godmother back in the days just an innocent but strong young lady was betrayed by the pretentious young male whos aspiring for the throne of the kingdom of his own country since both of them are orphans no moral issues can interfere with their goals but while maleficent becoming a strong yet caring semigoddess of her realm her counterpart in the humans world still wants the throne but not through some noble deed but as a merit of his servitude evil humans preferably males claim the right for the neighboring country of fairies but fail miserably in their attempt and maleficent fends off the attack with no problem so the king puts a bounty on her head and who else but the onetime lover of the strongest fairies can seduce and bereft her from her wings so mother nature i mean maleficent becomes vengeful waiting for her time to come turning into the evil fairy weve all been waiting for in the meantime for his servitude the little orphan becomes the king of his homeland forgetting about his fairylover and marring a beautiful human being who has all the characteristics of a devoted humble wife she gives life to the young princess aurora and actually her part of the story ends here we never see her again the storyline shows only here some reminiscence of the original tale maleficent bestowing the little child with her curse but from there the story evolves into another path maleficent carefully watching over her cursed goddaughter since the inapt fairies are unable to fulfill their task as babysitters little aurora becoming a young innocent blooming lady caring for nature and her surroundings not knowing of her true origin meets maleficent by chance and the two becoming friends  once maleficent even trying to withdraw her own curse while she is asleep she cannot but prince charming is already on his way giving hope that the one with pure heart can wake her up in the event she should sting herself with the spinningwheels needle which she does€ the prince with the help of maleficent gets into the castle and tries to wake aurora with his kiss but fails so comes maleficent kisses her on the cheek begging for forgiveness and my ohmy the young girl awakens from her sleep now that was the point where all those titles came into my mind and as the castle is brittle and princess aurora has already found her home in fairy land the two attempt to escape from her fathers home but ambush lurks around and poor maleficent gets trapped with iron net luckily aurora manages to escape from her own fathers castle ?? and a fierce battle ensues between maleficent and the king although at the end of the battle maleficent cries its over the king still wants to kill her but falls into his death after that maleficent reinstalls the once lovely garden of eden eh i mean fairyland and the two maleficent and aurora lives happily ever after somewhere in the background we can see prince charming i forgot his real name the characters name€ but with no special role in the set now aurora as the new queen of fairyland i mean i honestly believe that women should be more involved in the building of our society and equal rights and alike but come on this is an offense against all male viewers not a single time had i the feeling of seeing a positive male character not even the young prince who was more like a puppet for the will of maleficent in this world men are either aggressive or caring only for themselves but does not poses any kind of positive characteristics for which we could support them in such world male are only there to fulfill their task of fertilizing otherwise they have no earthly use females can live happily without males who can only bestow them with sadness and regret i guess this is the kind of attitude which turned this world into a hostile selfish hell not even orwell imagined in his wildest dreams the sheer evilness of the male characters who sometime selfpitying themselves for their own weakness is so onefolded that a paperbag is more versatile than that€ all in all the modern adaptation of the story find out the truth as the trailer puts it€ is not just disappointing but shows the zeitgeist in such mannerism that one should throw up€sorry€ females should be left alone with their fragile souls and naivety and only bothered by men if they humble enough to serve their needs trust me i am not a malechauvinist but after this piece of €film i honestly dont know what to do with my manhood?
