this movie is supposed to be a movie about life but life is more exiting than that if life were as boring and messed up as represented in the movie the rate of suicides would be much much higher as i watched this movie i expected something to happen but nothing ever did it is as if this movie was intended to make people depressed even the main actor that weird male version of kirsten stewart looked depressed and is it just me or he couldnt articulate properly? extremely irritating youd think that 12 years is enough time for someone to make a masterpiece hahaha as stated on the title ive seen commercials more exciting than that movie i dont think it deserved any oscar nominations the acting wasnt particularly good excepting the father he was the only character that didnt look depressed the story didnt have a plot or anything the movie is as pointless as a circle to imdb why is the rating so high??? 82 seriously???? this movie makes me wish there was a 0 star rating well i guess they can get one star for the effort i normally trust imdb ratings and check them for every movie i ever intend to watch however this rating is waaaayyyy too high for one of the worst movies ive ever had the misfortune to watch it is almost insulting how this movie can be amongst movies like the godfather goodfellas the lord of the rings inception movies that are actually good interesting to watch and a good conversational topic i seriously dont understand this rating out of all the friends and family members that have seen this movie no one has said anything good about it i tend to be positive but this movie is a serious wast of time
