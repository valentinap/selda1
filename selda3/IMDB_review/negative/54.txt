this was not a good movie as i thought i was expecting as i saw it was so disappointingwhen i watched the trailer i think it will be a blast butt no i sleep in the first 30 minutes of the movie awfuller but i decided to watch because of reviews i think it will be great in the end but no a bogus story no big thing as was expecting as named guardian of galaxy no way nothing wonderfulthe on other hand the graphics are good but remember when you are tallinn about space or rolling in the galaxy their should be some big and huge things and huge monsters like and the base of story line is so much disappointing as you can see that 5 bunch of buddies save the whole universe man thats not seems gud too me their should be a hero like the villain in the movie butt as i say the villain looks terrible but not as he looks looks like mountain from far but a mice from near loland another thing we saw in movie that the 5 buddies escaped the most advanced jail in the galaxy huh?how man how how how this is ridiculous and please hollywood dont waste our time and money to make movies like this ok
