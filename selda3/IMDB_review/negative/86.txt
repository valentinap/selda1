this might very well be the worst movie ever how it won best motion is beyond me the freaking use of the camera is just bad there is something documentaryish about the shooting of certain scenes like what you see in natgeo i cant seem to pinpoint the exact thing about it that ticks me off maybe it is the contrast coupled with the extreme clarity of the whole film anyway it just doesnt seem appropriate because it gave the whole movie a boring and lackluster feel most importantly i am so disappointed in the actors i love johnny depp but his character fell flat throughout the film he isnt a character i want to know more about and i cant detect any real sense of affection between the main couple their acting feels amateurish and johnny depp just lost a fan congrats i cannot bring myself to watch the whole thing because i just lost interest after he became a computer you might think thats when things get juicy well it didnt it got even more boring and clich basically the movies a real drag and the execution is horrible one good thing the concept is quite novel and pretty good too bad pfister screwed it up anyway dont watch it its uninspiring
