as the movie started i was excited to see a character wearing a mask with glowing red eyes i thought the opening scene was promising and then suddenly some nonserious music started to play the main character started to dance and everything went downhill from there after that there was special effect after special effect i love special effects but it did sound like this movie was made only to showcase special effects such as explosions explosions explosions and did i forget to say explosions? the special effects were indeed magnificent but it doesnt take long for you to realize it is all eye candy it is there to help conceal the fact that this is a movie made for ten year old kids to gaze at and go wow for everyone else and by everyone else i mean adults with thinking brains this extremely shallow and childish piece of work would be little more than a showcasing of special effects and cinematic techniques surprise surprise special effects do not make up for a shallow childish and extremely disjointed plot with performances that range from mediocre to downright terrible and they do not make a movie worth a mature persons time i loved the ghost rider thor and the amazing spiderman 2 even the avengers was tolerable but this one was simply a mess designing lots of weird looking characters with unpleasant colors and hair styles is like desperately asking the audience to love the movie just because it has some of the most weird looking characters ever seen in a movie men in black anyone? one of my biggest complaints and what really annoyed me throughout the movie is that while the special effects were great the combination of colors in most of the scenes was really unpleasant remember how thor had great colors in each and every scene? the colors actually went with one another you dont see that here a combination of light blue orange brown grey and a lot of colors that create a really awful combination was present in nearly every scene it was a huge letdown next time they should get a better art director so that they do not annoy the people who understand colors and art in summary this movie is not for adults take your kids to see it though they will definitely love it but since spending so much money only to entertain kids is not really justifiable theyd better stop wasting such huge amounts of money on movies like this and spend it where its really needed fighting ebola to save the human race would be a much better use of such a huge amount of money
