ego centered and senseless movie brian depalma pulls off one cool scene involving an exploding restaurant otherwise a box office success that will be baffling to people who watch it once the tom cruise star has faded if you love tom and he can deserve your love just doesnt this time youll like the fact that for a team movie there is no team its all just tom thats fine if you dont remember the original concept of the cool tv show and lets face it the makers of the film were betting you dont best moment however is when they briefly play the original theme music in a couple of spots dangling wire scene is a steal fro topkakiwhich for depalma is a signature moment what can you say about a career that has lasted for decades where his signature is stealing other directors signature moments here though he really gets to do very little he certainly was taking the job hoping and getting a hit film so he could go off to make his more personal hitchcock rip off films  dont get me stated anyway he doesnt get to work much style into mission final sequence on the train in the tunnel is the first of many abusive unconvincing cgi action scenes that have followed and dominated american movie making i dont mean to get on a soapbox here this film is bad as a stand alone without trying to blame it for other bad films cruise is too into being serious to enjoy the film and the script written and rewritten while they were shooting doesnt not hold together leaving cruise looking rather silly for playing it so seriously rather than with a isnt this fun? dont take it too seriously attitude that might have saved at least him the film was a hit feel free not to listen to me or feel free to actually watch this film as a film and see how poor it is for those who see brian depalmas cinematic stealings from other films as being his expression of style this time around he most effectively steals the hanging on wires gag from topkaki unfortunately he needed to steal some scenes from about 10 other good movies to help out the rest of this one most exciting moment in the film is when they briefly play the original theme musicthat moment leads into the topkaki riff if you were on a desert island and only had this film and its sequel to watch id say watch this one otherwise use them both to burn to make black smoke to attract rescue
