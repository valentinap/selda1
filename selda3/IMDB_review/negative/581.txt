how can we get brad pitt edward norton and meatloaf to beat the cp out of each other this movie solves that problem and gives the studio license to shoot a film veiled in psuedophilosophies and violence its just dumb dont try looking beneath the surface because nothing is there maybe thats the point it provides that men are imasculated and shackled by modern life their spirits crushed by their jobs and their possessions in order to escape you fight its so simple give up the banalities of ordinary life and find your individuality in a black tshirt fight gang makes sense teenage males will certainly think so since it is filmed in the mtv style bright color palette fancy edits blood mesmerizing and simple philosophies tend to go over well on that demographic it actually starts our promisingly i loved the first quarter only when it attempts to provide us with answers that are sorry far out of the grasp of the writers does it fail film buffs may want to view it simply for one of the sloppiest tackedon surprise endings in cinema history i could only laugh bottom line dumb
