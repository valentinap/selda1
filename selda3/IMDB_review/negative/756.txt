i can not believe that this movie received all the awards that it did it was long slow moving predictable and the acting was terrible i cant believe that they cut out over an hours worth of video to get it down to this length i wish that gandalf would have just given frodo a giant eagle in the first movie so that he could just fly in and drop the ring in the volcano and save us the pain of watching this series i was also worried that there was going to be a love fest between frodo sam and the other hobbits also with all of the computer generated scenes why go all the way to new zealand to film it at least it is all over with now
