i am a bit of a cinema buff and i have seen quite a few efforts from all over the world dating back to the very dawn of the art form this is worst film i have ever seen  it looked like an amateur home video to me except it was much much much much much longer too absurd and stupid to be really boring however this pseudo intellectual psychological stink bomb probably is held in awe by lovers of star wars and starbucks coffee the only fun i had while watching this disaster was trying to guess how it would end well i also had fun laughing at how badly written this movie was so i suppose in that sense i have to admit it was enjoyable to participate in this flaccid collapsing 911 of cinema i kept asking my girl friend when will this end? a few times i thought they were ready to pull the plug but no  like dracula it seemed to have eternal life it kind of just petered out one day and i think that maybe they just ran out of money or someone pounded a stake through the plastic kodak fixed focus they were using as a camera they certainly didnt run out of ideas because there were none to be found i am really astounded at how amateurish this piece of garbage was sorry i really cant do a more thoughtful profound review of this mess  my brain just wont do it
