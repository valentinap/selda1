zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz oh man i will never understand the appeal of this pointing a gun at somebody cussing for 5 minutes pulling the trigger walking up to somebody else and doing it again for an aeon like 2 hours is not very entertaining to me there was not one stunt in this movie and the camera angle never changed and just when you think its about to end nope it has to keep dragging onand onand on i feel like a noose was removed from around my neck when the credits finally rolled why everybody has the poster the soundtrack and the bumper sticker on their car is beyond me then again thank the maker it didnt win best picture rating a much deserved exhaustive negative 1 out of 10
