spoilers frankly put this movie sucked what could have been spectacular with only a little care was ruined oh dont get me wrong if you are some lazy movie goer who considers yourself an expert because you own the extended editions of the first two movies on dvd you will certainly enjoy this movie if you are like me a hardcore fan who has practically memorized the books i dont see how you can enjoy this film it starts out fairly well and continues like that for most of the film although the changes are not usually welcome at all cite arwens magnified part to make it sappy or gollum and frodo leaving sam altogetheri could have accepted that sure shelobs lair was all wrong well yeah it did annoy me that at some parts aragorn was more important than the whole ring of power which must be destroyed the whole love triangle was blown way out of proportion and by editing out his almost death it might have been possible to film some of the wonderful scenes in the book that the movies carelessly deleted but like i said it was all right until the end the ring was destroyed magnificently i admit the aftermath was done well but there is no excuse for skipping straight to the happy ending lalala sunflowers and daisy chains and frolicking puppies for all what the just happened no scouring of the shire for that saruman just might have been left out altogether no adjustment for frodo i might also add that by having gollum and sam make so much external conflict for him it practically obliterates all the internal conflict the audience is unprepared and confused when he decides to keep the ring however back to the mangled ending put aside the major parts in an effort to appeal to teenage girls i assume the filmmakers decided to give arwen a much larger role and make eowyns affection for aragorn much more serious as well so why do they not bother showing her courtship with faramir a large part of the books is condensed into two camera shots of them standing beside each other at the coronation of glorious king aragorn who seems to have washed his hair for the occasion i know he was on a trek in the wilderness no shampoo but how come he shaved more then but back to eowyn her sudden attachment to faramir makes her seem like she is nothing but a man chaser first she goes after aragorn future king and current war hero when he spurns her love she takes faramir steward and war hero as the next best option ridiculous just ridiculous to sum up do not see this movie do not waste your money this review is long i know but it could be so much longer if i wanted to mention everything wrong with the movies anyone who is a true fan will regard this as nothing but filth a pure waste of time
