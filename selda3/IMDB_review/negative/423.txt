i followed this series through the first season and kept thinking this guy stephen amellhas got to get better some how well that hasnt materialized i dont think stephen amell could make someone think he had to defaecate if he had a box of laxatives i i came across someone in real life with the emotion the characters display in this series im assume right away that they needed mental help its like people who didnt work out anywhere else all wound up here such a huge pool of bad talent and whats up with the mother and daughter do they have herpes? what the hell is on their lips?gross
