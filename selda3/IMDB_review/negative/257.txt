maleficent is the very first movie in my long list of movies that i have seen that i wanted to walk out of lets start with the positives angelina jolie was incredible she was beautiful she was strong and she executed maleficent beautifully her relationship with aurora was refreshing and nice the magical world was something that has been seen on movies like bridge to terabithia but it was still beautiful and engaging but all of this does not save the movie i expected to walk in and see a movie similar to wicked where we get a better understanding of the bad guy yes us understanding the bad guy does not excuse what they have done but we can see where they come from in the musical wicked and even in the movie great and powerful oz we have sympathy for the character we previously viewed as the bad guy we could see where she was coming from in those adaptations nobody truly ended up becoming the bad guy most were victims of circumstances in maleficent? it was ferngullyavatar all over again magical people good man baaaaaad instead of giving depth to all the characters that previously were left rather flat and on the background on the original sleeping beauty suddenly the king has been reduced to this one dimensional villain that created the evil maleficent and later on becomes obsessed with killing her he was given no aspects that would make us have even the tiniest bit of sympathy not the smallest bit of understanding he was just a vile man that broke maleficents heart mutilated her and cared only for power even when he tried to protect his daughter it was made appear more like he was protecting his property rather than a person he loved yes he graveled for her for a bit begging maleficent not to curse her but that was it the movie left all traces of the good of the humanity from it ok it had some of the good of humanity but the only human that was portrayed as good was aurora the movie tried to portray the three fairies as the comic relief but ended up just portraying them as idiots incompetent selfish creatures the fairies in the original disney movie were clumsy and unused to taking care of a child but they were like that because for the first time in their lives they could not rely on their magic to achieve things in life if were as modern people were thrown in to the middle of the woods and had to do everything by hand then yes we would be as lost as they were but they were given 16 years to evolve to learn and to grow but no the fairies were not given even the smallest of story arc in this movie they were creatures that switched sides when ever it benefited the movie i mentioned before that i liked the relationship that maleficent and aurora had in the movie but even that was shattered later on in the movie the solution to the problem was not a surprise at all it was taken straight out of frozen it was refreshing and incredible when frozen did it because it was the first time disney did not use the age old solution of a man being the one delivering the kiss of true love but when the same solution the same realization is done in a movie that came out within year of each other? it is boring and in no way exiting it is in no way entertaining we have learned nothing new is this disneys new approach in relationship? love between man and a woman is obsolete but the love between girl family kind of love not lesbian kids apparently cant handle that and also family excludes male family members at this moment as well only women can feel true loveis the strongest of all the loves in this world in the end the movie basically told the audience yeah the moviestory that has been told for decades is actually a propaganda and i should know because i am queen aurora and i was there all along the original sleeping beauty was rather black and white good vs evil when i walked in to the theatre i expected the lines to be blurred to be thought all stories have two sides not all of our actions are blatantly good or evil but instead the writers and directors and what nots decided to make the line between good and evil even more visible the good creatures are good no matter what they do and the bad humans are bad and rotten all the way in conclusion the movie might have given some depth to a villain that previously had been left as a rather one dimensional character but in exchange they created a new one dimensional villain just switching the genders around the worlds was beautiful and the lead actress was amazing but even she could not save this rehash of a movie in the end
