if you have technology to build spaceships that go through black holes and technology to make ai machines and robots that look like the monolith from kubriks space odyssey then you dont have to leave earth or any space body since you wouldnt need to any more you just remake the world as you see fit you can stop storms change the weather anyway you like it and grow any kind of food without even planting it you just synthesize all the minerals you need and give them any taste that you would like so the whole idea of this movie is ridiculous and the story itself is so full of plot wholes and just as inception it doesnt make any sense i mean come on some fake scientists writing some fake formulas to solve some fake theorems using some fake scientific methods are you serious? what is this bs???  to tell the truth this movie is nothing but a communist propaganda on a large scale to fool people into believing that life is really way too complicated to make it good for all people are made to think that living in compact spaces in tight spaces in an environment of deprivation is something that is ok and should be taken by people as something normal to fool people into thinking that if they are not going to shrink their living space then they have no chance of surviving they fool people to think that we need to give up life and become just button pressers sitting in small boxes high on fantasy they already have us sitting in our flatsapartments connected to the internet and they feed us a ton of bs every day all day all year and as you see since we have moved in into the cities the bs is getting stronger and stronger with each year and the tighter we are compacted into the cities the level of bs is so high that it just stops making any sense whatsoever have you noticed that all stories now at least the mainstream stories do not make any sense?? everything is so soaked in propaganda that the reality itself is getting destroyed by that propaganda you people should think about it all you who live in small flats and have no life you think about it next time you discuss how great all these movies are you think about how some bs fantasy drama bs moved you how emotional was the experience you think about it and then go back to your tight living space you know what? i dont think you get it the irony
