i went to see this last night with my wife in a screening and we both thought it was total tripe it was a brainless movie with terrible acting story and script even the special effects were done badly the story was absolutely rubbish and it was also far too violent the violence in this movie is so extreme it will make many people uncomfortable  i normally have no issues with violence in movies however this was totally and unnecessarily excessive there was also sadly the usual braindead racial stereotyping propaganda and ignorance in the movie as has become the norm for hollywood movies and some of the acting was so bad it was beyond laughable i have never seen acting as bad as samuel l jacksons acting in this movie and i also have no idea why people like michael caine agreed to be in this rubbish this film has been totally overrated by the media and has had ridiculous blanket advertising in most uk cinemas its sad to see this kind of rubbish getting so much financial backing and being forced on people  there are so many good movies which get no advertising or support this is seriously one to avoid
