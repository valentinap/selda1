the story was ruined the ending was drawn out the whole movie was shot in this ridiculous this story is so epic i will pan around and everything will seem really dramatic even when there is no real action way it was like a parody of itself i can hardly believe people could find any of the worth of the novels in this self aggrandizing trilogy i only paid $3 to see this film and was wishing for my money back after what shouldve been the final scene of the movie there was this fake 10 minute ending where thousands of people simply cheered on screen it was such a blatant way of telling people the fabulous movie the tremendous trilogy is over lets all celebrate it was terrible
