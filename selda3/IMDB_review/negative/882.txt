until it drops below the godfather the good the bad and ugly and any number of other films that are just that bit better in an historical context this does upset me slightly as it is in itself a very good film as the other reviews say the ledger is dead batman fans just went a bit overboard with the 10 10 scores at the start leaving us poor schmucks at the back of the queue to mark it down to where it should be what do i think honestly well 7s on imdb are usually a good watchable evenings entertainment 8s are things you would make a point of staying in for tipping or buying the dvd and anything 9+ is one of the best movies ever made yes this one is an 8something for sure as i would go out of my way to watch it again but the scoring correction continues so 1 star it is
