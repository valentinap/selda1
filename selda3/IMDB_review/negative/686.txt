the whole trilogy achieves to translate admirably well the deep boringness of the book replacing infinite descriptions with long empty tired repetitious and over emotional sequences totally misplaced considering the britney spears like deepness of characters characters are so flat and numerous that you waste half of the movie trying to remember who is who but it doesnt really matter anyway actions sometimes come to wake you up they are mostly entertaining but the most decisive and very awaited one is reduced to a game like greenish flow that is the only thing that happens to be fast in the whole movie be happy the end is near should be rated 5 to 7
