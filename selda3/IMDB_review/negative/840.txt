this is everything i dont want to see in a movie when i watch a movie i would at least hope for it to be more excited than my own little existence at my little house in the dead of winter id rather watch paint dry and its as if they did it all on one take the acting is the only halfway descent thing about it and thats because of the obvious triple a lineup this movie is very boring flat out i have seen more action and better writing in a spanish daytime drama there seems to be about 8 9 short films one after the other with only slight relevance to one another while me and my wife hated this movie we love all of the inside jokes we play about with each other now like how when we go out for icecream and we get a cherry my wife dramatically sucks and licks the cherry for 5 minuets making fun of the jackrabit slims scene i actually highly recommend watching this movie so you can see how horrible it is for yourself
