i was genuinely excited to hear that disney was going to make a film about maleficent my favorite disney villain of all time i was interested in knowing the why behind her actions in sleeping beauty since we never really got to see that i will say that the cinematography is amazing i will also say that while angelina jolie was not my first choice she had the look her costume was spoton and there are moments where you can see where she is at least trying to play this role correctly and really who could replace eleanor audley? but one thing ive noticed over the past 1015 years is that animation and design seem to be their main focus rather than story or character development in the movie maleficents back story was incredibly rushed so much for going into depth on why maleficent is the way she is this movie does not explain why maleficent is the way she is disney is showing us a completely different character while giving her the same name as disneys most iconic villain now theyre trying to say that maleficent is a misunderstood character who becomes evil but that never happens she becomes angry and bitter but not evil maleficent in this movie is not even a misunderstood sympathetic character she is a total victim who never becomes evil at all oh she does do one evil thing she does still curse king stefans baby out of revenge and she has second thoughts about it two seconds afterward see? not evil at all and while im at it i should mention my distaste for the way she cursed aurora disney completely lowered the stakes by having maleficent utter the words sleeplike death and be the one to offer the cure of true loves kiss no its merryweather that counters the death curse in order to save auroras life oh maleficent may say later that she doesnt believe true love exists but thats a matter of opinion isnt it? again lowers the stakes and what was linda woolverton thinking when she took king stefan and the three fairies completely out of character and gives them a complete 180 in order to make maleficent look good? if youre going to show us the point of view of a famous villain its okay to give them layers and gray areas in order to make them more interesting and multi dimensional even to show they werent always evil but not to say they were never evil at all that just completely defeats the point of the character same with the good guys they may have their own flaws show that they have their own prejudices or that everything they did wasnt perfect but not to say the good guys were really evil or stupid the fairies flora fauna and merryweather i refuse to call them by their new names are nothing like they were in sleeping beauty and this is a big deal in sleeping beauty say what you will about their flaws but their ultimate motivation was keeping aurora safe at least they tried even if they failed maleficent 2014 portrays them as nothing more than stupid buffoons who only care about saving their own skins aurora was just a means to an end for them they have no relationship with her like they do in the original the movie also took away their own personalities so they are no different from each other i cant even keep track of which fairy has which name watching them on screen with everything they say or do was as cringe worthy as i expected it to be king stefan has to be one of worst written villains i have seen in a while he has no real motivation for what he does we see him as having nothing in the beginning and then the movie glosses over his relationship with maleficent in order to get to the good part where he steals her wings in order to be king after that he wages war on maleficent for cursing his daughter and yet he only looks at aurora as afterthought property why is he even after maleficent then? what else has she done to him other than cursing his daughter? elle fanning as aurora was very impressive i do think she gave the character more of a personality that was lacking in the original and she stole the film in every scene she was in unfortunately that wasnt enough to save the movie nor were maleficents interactions with diaval as enjoyable as they were and of course maleficent does not turn into a dragon in this movie i have to ask why disney? you knew how loved of a villain maleficent is and her being a dragon is one of the many reasons why also we live in an age where technology and special effects are abundant you didnt use the opportunity to see how your most iconic villain looks as a dragon when done with liveaction cgi? why would you waste a perfectly good opportunity like that? besides the fact that maleficent is not evil in this film she also is very wimpy and pathetic she cant do anything when we see her fight an army at the beginning all she does is fly around and slap a few soldiers with her wings the tree monsters did most of her fighting for her in sleeping beauty she could transport herself to another place in a matter of seconds she could shoot lightning from her staff and she could transform into another form other than her own she didnt do any of that in this movie just like with alice in wonderland disney wasted a perfectly good opportunity to effectively adapt their animated work to the liveaction screen maleficent may not be the absolute worst movie ive seen but its definitely in my bottom list now
