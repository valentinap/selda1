this truly is a shocking movie and must rank as the worst scifi film i have ever had the misfortune to waste 25hrs on the acting is appalling with some quite amateurish edits the music drowns out a lot of the dialogue which is probably just as well considering its triteness the whole premise of the plot seems to have been cobbled together by the writers after theyd endured an overkill of everything from the lost in space tv series of the sixties though at least that show injected some humour into the proceedings through to 2001 a space odyssey and the innumerable star trek programmes and films any movie that casts michael caine as a scientific boffin must be struggling for starters he utters in one excruciatingly and barely decipherable scene i lied well he certainly didnt act anne hathaway struggles to make any sense of the quite ludicrous script and often appears that shed rather be undergoing rootcanal work whilst matthew mcconaughey mumbles and fumbles his way through lines he cant quite believe he is expected to say the continuity is confusing and the special effects only reach mediocre adding absolutely nothing new in this genre for the viewer i have watched hundreds of scifi films and programmes and do realise that we are expected to suspend belief to a greater extent which is why a little humour would not have gone amiss  but every character in the movie seemed to be so darn miserable and brimming with angst this film has no redeeming features whatsoever one develops no empathy for any of the players and there were a couple i longed would perish within a few minutes of them being introduced into the storyline the child who portrays the tenyear old murphy to name but one sorry but this film is not worthy of wasting over two hours of your precious life on there again you are quite entitled to think otherwise
