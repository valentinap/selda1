this movie was awful for a number of reasons first it is a terrible story for young kids especially young girls it constantly says that there is no love and the true love kiss is from angelia to the young girl i am all for female empowerment but female empowerment can do better than being anti man second the whole movie was cgi they put almost no effort into making this movie at all disney could have put a lot more effort into making this script and into the costume design plus angelia was super creepy anti fairy tales are all the rage and they can be made well but this is not one of them its ok to have a story that makes you feel good instead of making you feel like garbage at the end
