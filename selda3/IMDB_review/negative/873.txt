i saw batman begins and liked it although at the beginning i had a negative feeling for the dark knight i went to the movies with the greatest expectations after the big commercial that followed heath ledgers death everyone seemed to have liked it what a disappointment that was the movie is not bad but the critics make me hate it seriously i think that there are some movies ine the top #250 that are overrated but this one takes the cake from where i have to start the action scenes are nothing spectacular even tim burtons movie had better ones the music doesnt fit at the most of the sequences theres a repetitive tired to death theme that makes in almost every sequence thats the feeling i had batmans voice is like robocop is talking or something like that its not even clear what he is saying in some points i think it would be easier to say what i liked on this movie cause there are not many things i liked well heath ledgers acting was good although i think that jack nickolsons acting was more close to what i had in mind of joker character more sarcastic and funny in a crazy way heath made a good bad guy but he is more serious than a joker should be so why so serious avoid this movie there are a lot of better movies out there its just a trendy hype that i hope in some years will fade away
