i get the hype really linklaters before trilogy was fantastic i especially loved before midnight and people were justified in expecting great things from boyhood what i dont get are the numerous and nearly uniformly raving reviews this film has been getting from the critics and everyone else im utterly baffled by this critics are using words like masterpiece monumental profound and so on to describe this movie the film is currently sitting at #58 on imdbs top 250 all this praise is making me feel like a crazy person because i felt boyhood absolutely didnt deliver on the hype in fact the movie cant even be described as mediocre i feel like i need to make on thing clear here just because boyhood had the novel idea of shooting a film with the same actors during a long period of time doesnt grant it any automatic points a novel idea or approach may pique my interest and convince me to see a movie but thats as far as it goes we dont appreciate and enjoy movies simply because someone put some effort into them there has to actually be something there to justify spending our precious time and money to watch pixels on a screen for a couple of hours now lets jump into my gripes with the movie firstly boyhood has absolutely no distinct style it is a lifeless husk without form or anything resembling a cinematic look just like one other reviewer put it boyhood felt like watching a home movie about someone you dont know and dont care about i cant remember a single scene where i thought wow thats a neat shot or a moment where some cinematographic choice actually enhanced the scene that tells a lot about the cinematographic effort and choices that were put into this film bland and uninspired is to put it mildly the editing does the film no favors either right when something emotional or important could have happened the movie simply cuts to another scene and doesnt reference or deal with what happened previously in any way it all felt terribly directionless for example mason ellar coltrane gets bullied in a school bathroom okay great probably something many of us can identify with how did it get to this? how does he deal with it later on and how does it affect him? we simply dont know its a wholly detached scene with no meaning at one point theyre planting obama signs on peoples lawns great maybe theyre idealistic about the political system and theyd later revise their views or something? nope none of that is ever mentioned or dealt with in any way again most of the scenes are like this and go absolutely nowhere when the film actually goes back to something that was introduced earlier it feels extremely contrived like with the bit about masons mom advising a latino immigrant about going to school and how he later comes back to thank her for that encouragement really subtle guys there were a few scenes where i was slightly amused and that mostly about how awkward the scene was but mostly i was just constantly cringing at how bad the acting and the writing were i guess thats the risk you run into when you cast young actors and stay with them for twelve years  they might just not be that good at acting ellar coltrane seemed like hed had a shot of horse tranquilizer before every scene hes that apathetic and dull the characters have no real depth or character arcs and i didnt care or get attached to any of them masons philosophic rants were cringeworthy and uninteresting they also seem to come out of nowhere and therefore feel unearned at no point did i think that they really struck a chord with what it was like growing up during the 90s and the 2000s i was simply depressingly bored for most of the movie many have complimented this movie about being close to real life well thats debatable but that shouldnt be an automatic positive either watching paint dry and standing in the line in the grocery store is real life too i dont want to see banal mindlessness when i go to the movies but maybe thats just me a film this ambitious should really have something original to say instead it just wasted my time
