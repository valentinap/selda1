alright odds are youre going to hate this because i didnt really like this movie and im fairly blunt sometimes my extremely detailed summary this is what i get for finally going into a movie blind thinking it has morgan freeman and depp and paul bettany in it so it has to be passable at least right? well the director was very awful and the story was ridiculous its a movie about the singularity and dealing with it and while there are some things in that id like to believe happen someday its not going to happen in this manner here we go basically depp is a brilliant weirdo and married to his soulmate wifeperson they work in genetic computing so depp gets shot by a psycho and is going to die so emotional wifeperson takes the next step and downloads depps brain into the pc system hes been developing and it works the psychos are attacking all over its calamity jim what can we do? we have to hide inside this totally undefended abandoned school from our childhood which happens to be housing this extra copy of the worlds most advanced computer set up system we need that anyone could have just walked up and used  super computer depp needs to be connected to the internet and does get connected for approximately 1 second and is now spreading himself over everything everywhere but it took days to download his brain?  super computer depp does shady stock works to make his wife rich and so then hes going to work towards fixing humanity in some method that computers believe is best so he needs a place to do this he decides and hes smarter than us so this has to be right that this place should be underground under a desert in california right beside this piece of crap hopeless hick town wife will use newfound riches to build it  this might be reasonable except wife hires one redneck hick from the town to build it  redneck hick is successful in a few seconds and *poof* we have this insanely gigantic underground facility full of technical equipment never before seen to man so it didnt actually take a few seconds but in actual movie time it was more like a month  deppbot starts healing people with nanobots and taking over their bodies making them super strong and super smart or restoring vision this seems fine except theyre now brainwashed into a nanozombie state  deppbot decides this is better for everyone starts recruiting more people for miracles  bettany is aware things arent good and teams up with the original psychos including a daenerys clone that shot depp to try and bring him down they hide under copper wire nets and eventually steal the original redneck hick since nanoprogrammed into a superzombie deppbot cant see through copper wire it blocks his wireless signal  bettany helped live depp program the original ai system hes the only one that can stop this  in a few seconds he comes up with a virus that can take down deppbot and injects it into the wife shes going to die but its going to be for the good of humanity  attack plan time the psycho team mounts an assault on depps field of solar energy panels to distract him while wifey goes and is like oh save me lover deppbot or something and gets him all secretly hell never see it coming  using four guys the fake mother of dragons three guns and a 1910 style mortar gun dragged around on by trailer hitch on an elderly chevy van they defeat the evil nanozombie townsfolk despite a large number of shading things happening  bettanys virus is uploaded to all the internets in the entire world infecting everything and shutting the internet off and turning it back to a prestone age state also known as 1986 after all its better than an army of depp clones that use wireless internet to steal people theyre nanobots you know theyre in everything now  humanity is saved yes ***big reveal*** i wont reveal it but what doesnt happen is depp isnt like screw your internet im gonna make my own internet to run my life he made his own new self out of synthetic flesh and whatnot he reincarnated himself as a living breathing deppbot but he apparently cant defeat the lack of 80111ac wireless i can assure you that that did not happen even though his nanobots are in everything moral of the story this movie is impressive in its illogical hilarity which is extremely difficult to describe or attempt to write down i didnt include most of it it might be worth it to watch and make fun of in a sort of count the number of times the wet bandits die in home alone sort of way but otherwise dont we got like 5 minutes of morgan freeman in this one apparently theres only so much morgan freeman to go around and some other movie needed an old black guy i hope you appreciated this summary but odds are youre bugged now
