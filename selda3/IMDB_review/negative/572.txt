fight club is the most overrated movie i have ever seen barely beating out gladiator it is also one of the worst movies ive ever seen its only redeeming quality is if you take it as an examination of mob mentality in a group of reprobates  except in that light its quality ends up seeming like someones final project for their high school psychology class as in amateurish and not very detailed people talk about its depth my answer to that is what depth i have no problem with its premise  people are dissatisfied hey i could handle the computers that rule the future can build a nearlyindestructible attack robot out of liquid metal in terminator 2 dissatisfied people is nothing even the incorrect placement of blame is believable what bothers me though is that the movie attempts to pass itself off as an accurate portrayal of the real world im not saying there arent people like that what im saying is that they arent right they arent automatons theyre unambitious they arent suppressed by an overlymaterialistic society theyre just whining and looking for someone else to blame for their problems i have an easier time believing marxs nonsense about class identity than i do the things this film tries to pass off as meaningful social commentary fight club doesnt have a social message fight club isnt entertaining dont watch fight club
