 next to burt lancasters the swimmer this is the worst movie ive ever seen if you like two hours of non stop profanity senseless violence and a story that has no beginning no middle and certainly no conclusion and if you like an underlying theme of inhumanity and perversion then i recommend it it you want a story that is well acted and well thought out dont waste your time this is a movie geared for an audience that is very young if only in mentality and very unexperienced in life
