this movie is very very very times 10 to the 100th power bad i mean come on brad pit and edward norton in a fight id rather watch a pokemon fight then those two weak fruity actors fight but brad was ok in ocean 11 and 12 monkeys plus the whole plot is just way over the top it tries to appeal to a smart audience but i think it can only appeal to a dumb one this film total insults capitalism and america it tries to make some political statements but it is just a 2 hour piece of garbage i should have known better than to rent this weak movie the movie cover simply has a picture of a bar of pink soap that should have told me not to watch it but since the reviews were kind of good i rented it anyway thats the last time i watch something with a piece of pink soap on the movie cover
