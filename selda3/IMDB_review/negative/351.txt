i watched this painfully boring movie to the end  all 2+ hours of it everything in the film rang false i am not as erudite as some of the negative reviewers here but they are not lying i hate movies that try to press the same fake emotional buttons over and over again parental guilt love duty heroism blah blah blah this movie does it at every turn until you cant stop groaning the suspension of disbelief what every work of fiction aims to achieve once that stops working youre in trouble no you cant drive a truck at top speed with a flat tire through a cornfield without losing control no corn is not harvested by a combine and left lying on the ground when it is green then there were a lot of scientific facts that were ignored or glossed over about space travel im not a scientist but there were many times when i said wait what that doesnt sound right anyway i think i reached the minimum number of characters so i can stop do not pay to see this movie enough said
