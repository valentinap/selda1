i was expecting a lot more from this weak and slightly laughable movie johnny depp is literally sleep walking he has all the presence of a cardboard cut out and seems like he just doesnt care depp plays dr will caster a genius who takes technology all the way by working out how to upload a human consciousness into a quantum computer well lots of them a terrorist attack sees the doctor poisoned with weeks to live so his wife evelyn rebecca hall and best friend max waters paul bettany do the unthinkable they upload him this idea is not new there have been other films with a similar idea and also a twilight zone episode the character of joseph tagger morgan freeman could have been played by anyone as the character had no substance what so ever and freeman was predictable and unchallenged there is a ghost town that ends up home to the doctors mega lab locals made invincible and joined like the borg on star trek the entire government is represented by one man the army by a few more the terrorist wind up working with the good guys to stop the doctor never mind that they where the ones who killed the doctor in the first place well his body anyway its silly and it ends badly but not too soon for me
