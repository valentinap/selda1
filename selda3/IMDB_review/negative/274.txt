kingsman the secret service  the triumph of bad taste poor script poorly executed the action fake the play of many actors is weak colin firth is good but samuel jackson is ridiculous the music is just noise filthy language in every sentence it left an impression that the people in this movie dont know any language to express their needs or emotions absence of sense of class taste or style the first 5 min was intriguing but the following was boring frustrated my children decided to nap but the typhoon of the torturing noise didnt allow them to relax when the film finally was over people left the room speechless and with relief production of such movies is a confusing message to the youth a terrible disappointment
