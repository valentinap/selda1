interstellar one of the worse films ive seen in a long time 170mins of self indulgent rubbish slow and tedious does not even begin to describe this $160 million piece of nonsense the horrible church organ hans zimmerman music score often drowns out the dialogue so badly that the sound mix must have been done by helen keller terrible special effects that look like they come from a movie made in the 70s a shameless ripoff from 2001 gravity dark star contact to mention just a few awful wideeyed hammy performances from all concerned a terrible nonsensical script with enormous plot holes and hilariously bad science christopher nolan should never be allowed to make another film again i deeply regret those 170 minutes that this monstrosity has taken out of my life unfortunately theres no wormhole that can take me back before i made the unfortunate decision to see this film
