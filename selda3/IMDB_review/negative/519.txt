at first i thought i was in a horror movie or a lame lord of the rings type rip off but then this lame movie turned out to be a save the planet preachy flick i give this three stars maimly because of my favorite actress is in it and as always does a great job and that would be imelda staunton other than this i would rate this movie but one star i was looking forward to a fresh interpretation of the bible story instead was treated to this i like well told stories but this should have been returned to the writer and put the money to better use sorry mrs pitt it at least appeared the you were trying thanks but i will not rent this one and waste more money the producers spent a fortune on this and they will get their money back before its all over but they should look at disney classics and even movies that have been churned out after disneys demise at a fraction of the cost and have been very successful from toy story miniseries to the lion king remake there is a strong interest in genuine faith based movies there was nothing genuine about this just empty meaningless hollywood hype
