if the first film bored you to tears and the second one bored you to death the third film will not affect you because you are now numb and totally disinterested we have even more of those pointless scenes with sam and frodo more battles and more cgi and how many endings can a film have theres a huge battle and then they tell you there is another one and its still not over because there are a million loose ends and then they go back home and then bilbo leaves home and then sam has children is that the end or is there more i cant even remember i fell asleep during one of the particularly tedious scenes with sam and frodo this is not a film its a pointless sequence of scenes and an exercise in cgi that resembles a video game one you can only watch but not play and i still dont care about a single bloody character in this film
