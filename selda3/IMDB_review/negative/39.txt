was almost not going to give this movie a pass having a feeling that it was going to be a bloated mess and oh my what a bloated drawn out rudderless and boring bloated mess it was i have never felt like walking out of the cinema while watching a movie but at the half way point of this film i was tempted it was that bad the story was a meandering affair not really going anywhere from start to finish with nonsensical and clich_ dross thrown in for good measure it didnt feel like a scifi more like a soppy drama with a few scifi elements thrown in and the special fx where nothing special a few ok scenes but for the most part it was bland bland bland i thought it was going to be an innovative trippy kubrikesque like film with a lot of bizarre and amazing visuals and strange and unique vistas and scenes aliens strange technologies otherwordly gods instead it boiled down to a silly soap opera with bickering astronauts and crying family members avoid
