the most disappointing movie of 2015 so far i was looking forward to it since the divergent was pretty consistent with just a few awkward spots however insurgent i would call it complete trash with just one goal  earn money the visual effects were good except for those long shots being made just for the 3d  like the flying above the city in the end it looked so cheap the plot is predictable very slowboring most of the crucial moments are too shallow in their results the movie completely lacks logical structure  not sure if its written like this in the book too spoler alert how everyone is so ok not to guard a guy who had been an enemy just few moments ago? how would whole army get to the building without being noticed?
