 it bugs me that this movie is rated so high not because its a bad movie but because its a mediocre one apparently mediocre people reward mediocre cinema this movie tanked big time when it was initially released and with good reason it wasnt until pseudo intellectuals across the country started hyping it as defacto favorite movie for lowbrows world wide that it started dominating the imdb best movie list in reality shawshank is like a sewage pump for every idiotic prison movie clich‹© ever made every guard is a monster the warden is religious therefore evil not a single prisoner is actually guilty or if they are theyre so obviously redeemed that were supposed to feel sorry for their unfair imprisonment murderers and sex offenders sit around in beatific awe as opera plays over the loudspeakers right the whole movie is so fake so smarmy and so condescending that its no wonder that so many americans with their odd addiction to fake smarmy condescending things consider it their favorite movie i guess thinking for yourself is a burden to great for some of us to bear
