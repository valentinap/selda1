i dont know why walt disney movies have become so dull and tasteless the story of cinderella is a great storybut the acting is simply terrible and the movie is so boring the story of cinderella follows the fortunes of young ella whose merchant father remarries following the tragic death of her mother keen to support her loving father ella welcomes her new stepmother lady tremaine and her daughters anastasia and drizella into the family home but when ellas father suddenly passes away she finds herself at the mercy of a jealous and cruel new family finally relegated to nothing more than a servant girl covered in ashes and spitefully renamed cinderella since she works in the cinders ella could easily begin to lose hope yet despite the cruelty inflicted upon her ella is determined to honor her mothers dying words to have courage and be kind she will not give in to despair nor despise those who abuse her and then there is the dashing stranger she meets in the woods unaware that he is really the prince and not merely an employee at the palace ella finally feels she has met a kindred soul it appears as if her fortunes may be about to change when the palace sends out an open invitation for all maidens to attend a ball raising ellas hopes of once again encountering the charming kit alas her stepmother forbids her to attend and callously rips apart her dress but as in all good fairy tales help is at hand as a kindly beggar woman steps forward and armed with a pumpkin and a few mice changes cinderellas life forever disney failed to make a masterpiece from this clich_most kids including my children hated this film and found it boring and uninteresting the story of cinderella has been extremely overusedi dont know why disney insists on making a new modern version from this clich_ definitely disney needs to make a lot of money i advise you to avoid this moviebut if you wanna see this moviesee it on your own responsibility
