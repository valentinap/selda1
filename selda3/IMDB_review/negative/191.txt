so  i was yesterday to see this big movie which has a rating of 87 close to the lord of the rings movies the same as matrix or inception and even better than seven or usual suspects it should be good right? doesnt matter that marvel made only crap movies most of them anyway with a few exceptions some of the first spiderman movies and some xmen movies maybe they nailed it this time so the movie starts and after the first scenes we see our hero on an abandoned planet dancing as he goes to collect the item he came for he is not thinking that while he is listening music at his headset someone may be nearby anyway he got what he came for and the scene is very similar to the one in indiana jones no surprise this entire movie is a rip off of other movies you have you hero which is a smuggler and becomes one of the good guys star wars you have a pair a raccoon and a tree only the raccoon understands the tree star wars again our hero out of the nowhere falls in love with the femaleagain star wars only in star wars the process was more real and more fun also like other marvel movies the characters do illogical actions in the most important moments gomora after she fights to the death with her sister trying to cut the power tries to save her when her sister was holding on the edge of the ship while peter quill and the others were waiting for gomora to cut the damn power another stupid moment was when ronan at last he lands but he doesnt destroy the planet the thing he wanted the most to do no he looks at our hero dancing speechless and how did drax survived when he and ronan are hit by a ship at full speed piloted by raccoon? so guardians of the galaxy is a movie full of meaningless special effects explosions after explosions characters that are poorly written actors that dont act very well a poor script and ideas borrowed from other movies conclusion another boring movie by marvel highly over rated i dont know how i think marvel fans are overzealous or the people are just getting dumber day by day you wanna see a good scifi movie watch any of the star wars movies
