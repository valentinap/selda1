having just finished viewing fight club on video my opinion is it was awful however i noticed i was in the vast minority of others who voted just goes to show how opinions can vary i did like the cast and felt the three lead characters were very good but their talents were wasted if you took out the popularity and charisma of pitt and norton and replaced them with lesser known actors the video would hardly be worth watching
