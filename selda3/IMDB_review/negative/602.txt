i voted this movie be 110 stars on this website which is way to much for a movie like this i didnt like the atmosphere in the film at all beating each other without any reasonable reason besides that there were lots of blasphemic things in this movie in combination with very violent language i think filmmakers show that they are incompetent by using a script that contains lots of violent words why would you might think right now almost all real good movies like gladator the green mile lord of the rings and the shawshank redemption show us that you create atmosphere by good acting and story tellingtherefore you dont need actors to use blasphemic language all the time this movie was bought by a friend of mine and we watched it at his home we both got so sick and tired to watch this crap that he opened the dvd player even before the movie actually ended and broke the dvd we went smoking outdoorsbut my evening was truly spended on a movie worthless to see
