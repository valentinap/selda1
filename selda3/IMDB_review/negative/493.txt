do not believe the reviews this does not come close to an all time great movie i really question someone that gives this movie a good review its completely too long and filled with holes in noway does it come close to connecting any dots the only reason i went to see this movie is because of the 91 rating at the time but my first instinct was correct this movie is not worth watching ever maybe if they shaved 1 hour off but as is stay away after watching this movie i felt compelled to open an imdb account and review my first movie ever because of these reviews that are complete nonsense
