obviously this was a faithless and pointless butchering of the novel but whats worse a terrible movie lacking flow sense linearity and dramatic impact this played out like a highlights reel not a coherent story the actors did an admirable job with the awful dialogue and nosensical personalities they were given with some exceptions peter jacksons only two abilities seem to lie in super close up and super wide out shots both of which are heartily abused and the special effects for the most part would have been better served by a cardboard set and some directing ability there were high points but this was and is the first and only movie i have ever left before the end and they barely kept me there but for the eowyn nazgul scene a hollywood blockbuster no doubt a good movie hell no possessing anything in common with the literature it is supposedly based on the fact is if this were based on real events i dont think the people involved would have given them to right to use their real names maybe that wouldnt be such a big deal if i didnt have to hear about jacksons love of the books or read reviews that discuss staying true to the source material there is hardly a scene or underlying theme in the movie that has anything to do with the books this movie could probably have been worse but i would be hard pressed to know how
