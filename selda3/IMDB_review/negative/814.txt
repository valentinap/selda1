okay so ive seen this now and i began asking myself how could this movie possibly end up on 1st place at imdb and how come everyone loves this movie ive seen this and its horrible i fell asleep after watching two hours of this this and pirates of the caribbean is the only movies ive fallen asleep to seriously and yet its so unrealistic like when don corleone is out buying fruits he gets shot like eleven times and still survives you would die after two shots from those types of guns also go see donnie brasco if you like gangster movies this is bad really bad
