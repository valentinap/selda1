i dont know if you have seen the same movie ive seen but this movie was awful i really really liked the first movie an obvious 10 the second was a little bit worse yet still a 7 but this one was really bad i mean what is the reason for a happy happy happy happy end which is 30 minutes too long the characters are flat and no one cares if anyone of the main characters dies or notlike the king because you cant feel connected to them gollum should be dead two times before he is falling into the fire it is just boring after the second part if hords of orks are fighting against man and the worst thing was legolas after sliding down this elephant like animal and posing so bad animated and so silly unfortunately this movie was so disappointing like matrix 3
