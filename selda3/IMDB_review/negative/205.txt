really flynn? you treat your customers of your art like this? so bad empty no sense no closure just brutal way to treat us you are writing to entertain do that dont punish us with an ending you just cant figure out on your own  hire help im sure stephen king or dan brown could have given you a better ending  no charge the story moved along nice and you had me but the twist  it was good i think the hole in the script was the couple that stole money from amy they would have gone to the press probably sold their story once they realized who they stole money from i mean those kind of characters always do that? i actually thought thats what you would do wrong instead you killed 25 hours of my life plus another 10 minutes writing this dribble next time im reading spoilers for any of your stories to make sure i dont waste any more time
