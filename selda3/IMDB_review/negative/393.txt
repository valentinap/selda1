i must say that i really didnt like this film all that much though since i had seen the first i felt that maybe i should go and see the second one though i am having second thoughts as to whether i will go and see any more basically the film follows on from the first film where the divergents have fled the city and are now hiding out with one of the factions that lives out in the country however this what were it was a little confusing at the end of the first film i thought they have fled behind the wall however it turns out that they hadnt but instead were hiding out in one of the rural areas secondly i though much of the city had been rebuilt and from what i can remember of the first film chicago was nowhere near as ruined as it was in this film basically the villain comes across this box hidden in one of the ruins and realises that she must find a divergent to be able to open it so she sends out her guards namely the members of dauntless who remained loyal to her to track them all down as it turns out trix is the one divergent that is able to open the box however the problem is that she is in hiding as are all the other divergents however that is all i really feel that i can say about this film i thought it was boring the acting was pretty ordinary and i ended up sitting in my seat for the two hours that the film went for quite uncomfortable and waiting for it to end it seemed that i enjoyed the first film and obviously there will be a conclusion but a part of me simply wants to read the wikipedia entry for the book so i dont have to spend anytime sitting around the cinema watching it when i could be doing something else i hope they dont go and do what they did with the hunger games and split the final book into two movies but we will see when they get around to releasing it
