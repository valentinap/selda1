this show is bad period the only reason is watched it is so that i can bitch about it it has characters and scenes ripped out of batman begins come on with all that budget you could have at least made an effort batman and robin with adam west was more entertaining and one could argue more genuine they had the formula they knew they were being cheesy and they knew they were making it for kids sold but arrow is as lame as they come stephen amell dude nice work with the body building but you could have shaved off some of that hard jaw gritting internalizing stuff he looked like he was constipated most of the time and the man was simply trying too hard to portray oliver queen as a conflicted damaged and deeply hurt it was simply not believable laurel lance oh laurel couldnt one of those arrows accidentally misfired and killed her in episode 1? laurels character is a bimbo who wants to save the world and expects to be fed the truth by everyone she has a relationship with the audience of course wonders why anyone would be truthful to this girl if she simply is not about to handle the truth the saving grace of this entire waste of money comes in the form of david ramsey who plays diggle and paul blackthorne who plays quentin lance brilliant actors who do it well if stephen amell did not have davd ramsey to bounce off a lot of scenes off hed be a dead fish floating on the river nile for all one would care i could go on but in all fairness the actors worked hard i give em that the fault really lies with the writing and direction its movie making at its worst the show is forgettable or maybe to be more accurate this show will be remembered only because it is so bad im giving it two stars  one star for david ramsey and one for paul blackthorne
