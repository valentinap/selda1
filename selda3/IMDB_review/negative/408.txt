i have seen birdemic birdemic 2 the room sharknado and etcetera but none of them come remotely close to this terrible film the aforementioned are at least comical in their terribleness boyhood is neither funny nor inspiring or anything positive for that matter halfway through the film i felt myself wishing that ellar coltrane had died in a tragic car accident or something of the sort just to prevent this film from ever being produced the concept for the film is splendid and one of a kind unfortunately nothing else was remotely interesting please save yourself 3 hours and do something else eat some dirt lick a bee smack your arm with a sledgehammer repeatedly for 2 and a half hours to give yourself half an hour to spare anything and i mean anything is better than this film
