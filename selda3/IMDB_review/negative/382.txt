i really wanted to like this film i was looking forward to watching it after reading the rave reviews and seeing the trailer now having seen it what an awful movie _ although the film starts out promisingly enough except for the heartstringstugging opening in the hospital it rapidly becomes the same old shoot em up that you have seen innumerable times the special effects are good but the fightbattle scenes are too frenetic to be able to follow the action clearly i also found the plot torturous and difficult to follow due to the proliferation of double crosses unclear explanation of who the bad guys are and then the bad guys behind the bad guys confusion with all the different places empires etc and their interrelationships some of the dialogue was execrable with chris pratt talking like a dude from 2014 ironic considering he was abducted by aliens decades ago
