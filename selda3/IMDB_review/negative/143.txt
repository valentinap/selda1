the mumbled and unintelligible dialogue lost me for the first ten minutes but i gave it a second chance as the mystery developed the boring characters were just about bearable as the plot began to twist and turn but affleck and pike were so cold and mysterious even with each other that it was hard to like either of them so where was your emotional engagement here? only margo was remotely interesting this film also had some of the least erotic and downright odd sex scenes ever filmed this was a film of two parts the first part ran through all the clichs of the detective thriller but we were cheated in the second part when the villainess inexplicably got away with it in agatha christie books when the killer makes a mistake and has a sudden change of plans this is usually their undoing as things planned for the original crime stand out like sore thumbs in the adapted scenario then they get caught end of story in this particular tale it was the diary why would desi have taken it to a house he didnt know existed and fail to burn it properly when he could have burnt it in seconds in the fire at the crime scene ? the cops would have seen through that in seconds and then the rest of her contradictions would have unravelled what about the attempted purchase of an illegal gun ? the purchase of the car the credit card purchases of the electronic toys the puppets the treasure hunt clues ? none of which could be attributed to desi so someone else must have organised or staged them and just who was supposed to have tipped off the cops to the woodshed ? all non  sequetors that made no sense in the end columbo would have had her in the slammer long before the final reel but the cops just let her off  the non  examination by the medics of the blood covered pike was utterly ridiculous this hospital must miss lots of wounds as they simply dont look for them dont let me get taken to this sloppy hospital if i get run over  she would have had none of the injuries from the initial kidnapping but a mysterious venepuncture wound on her arm both of which would have lead the cops once again to think the kidnapping had been staged we also got treated to homages to fatal attraction and the hand that rocked the cradle were the female lead had to be totally insane not just confident and calculating this is the old male gaze all women are evil psychos drivel being rehashed for a new generation and we can do without it
