the visuals were wonderful and that is about all i can say that was good about this film either the men were without members or were brutish bastages that were the cause of all the problems it started out good but why is it that there has to be a different take on a film or story just to outright slander defile and degrade men? i tried to like it but i see this trend in a lot of movies today women can be pure evil in their own right without the help of a man i was really hoping that elle fanning would shine in this film but she was mind numbingly dull the three fairies were stupid the prince should not even have been in the film if he was not going to save her with a kiss the true loves kiss part was wickedly betrayed by what only another woman can give even if she is not the girls mother is this what you want your daughter to think about men in general?
