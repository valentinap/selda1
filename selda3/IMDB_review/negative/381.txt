i rely on imdb when it comes to decide what to watch and what not to watch rating of 92 looks so attractive that i didnt even bother to check the trailer i went to watch the movie with very high expectations but was very disappointed as i was watching it i was thinking maybe know it will start to make sense but it didnt even by the last scene it was a total bollywood drama where hero doesnt die no matter where he is the most funny part was when he press the eject button in space it does has some big star cast but the base story line crumbles beyond imagination it was like monkeys had written the script as they has shown in south park awful movie total waste of time and money please go if you hate yourself or your life which is one and the same thing
