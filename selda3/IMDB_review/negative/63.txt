this movie was way too long scenes were dragged out unnecessarily matt damons appearance was random to say the least and added nothing to the story the plot was weak and made no logical sense this was such a disappointment i cant believe i have seen the same movie as those who have given it 9 stars???? all in all i felt this was a wasted 3 hours of my life that i will not get back this movie was so bad it made gravity look amazing and amazing it wasnt i felt that the music in the film was so loud at times that this drowned out key points in the plot and it wasnt an enjoyable experience straining your ears to try and figure out what was going on in the movie i found it hard to connect with any of the characters which was a let down as i love matthew mcconaghey and anne hathaway
