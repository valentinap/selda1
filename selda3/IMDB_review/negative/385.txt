i really like the series with peter grave 171 episodes between 1966 and 1973 and 35 episodes between 1988 and 1990 who shows jim phelps and his team saving the good against the bad and make of the character of jim phelps a traitor was too much for me it was simply disrespectful for all person who knows the 2 series it was better to kill the character in mission than make him an traitor now if i forget the series my vote will be an 6 the train under the channel was really too much an helicopter behind a train in a tunnel the explosion of this helicopter who only punch tom cruise back on the train the rest of the movie was better i like the scene with the explosion of the aquarium sorry for my english but my mothertongue is french
