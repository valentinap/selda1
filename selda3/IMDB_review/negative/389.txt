i really cant enjoy a clich like this one and i dont understand how people can get behind an awful childish movie like guardians of the galaxy cheap jokes and laughs seen that done that scenes bad guys and visual effects i didnt care much for any of the characters in the movie and the powerful connection between the members of the team had to be the most important part of it nobody was funny there werent any cool jokes and creative and visually stunning scenes it was just another scifi ripoff from the major productions in the genre huge disappointment dont watch it 85??? people are weird not the movie
