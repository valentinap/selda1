the dark knight is all hype and no substance ive seen it 3 times and it is just plain awful basically it is too long and convoluted as all get out it felt 4 hours long to me the first time i saw itno kidding i guess the confusing part is worse than the long part if a film flows smoothly for its run length ought not be an issue but tdk is utterly messy and confusing for its running time so nolan wants a realistic version of batman then explain some things to us the big one is how does joker set all this stuff up at least batman begins was grounded in realism explained motivations techniques and plans and had a aura of realism after bb was over i remember thinking i liked this movie although im a burton batman fan i admit that nolan did a very good job with bb it feasibly defined a realistic batman world while still embodying a sense of fun and had a lot of entertainment value and the plot made sense but after tdk was over my impression was what the heck was that some points about why tdk is a weak film to me harvey dent swallows all that gasoline and isnt even sick enough to hurl he is badly burned but his rage and need for vengeance dulls his pain and he easily walks around and does not scare the bejesus out of anyone no one is shocked by the way he looks seriously nolan gordon and batman decide that dent twoface will be a hero and no one will know that he killed 5 people except for them gordons family and that bad cop ramirez im sure they will all keep it a secretplothole maggie gyllenhall as rachel dawes not attractive katie holmes from bb wasnt jaw droppingly gorgeous but she was fairly easy on the eyes and holmes worked much better in this role in bb had a lot more chemistry with bale and had an important function to the story when joker says that she gyllenhalls rachel is a beautiful woman i was like no shes not gyllenhaal is perhaps a better actress than holmes but holmes was actually much more right for the role of rachel dawes gyllenhaal literally has nothing to do and just doesnt cut it in tdk lucius fox played by morgan freeman who just exists in this film nothing else has the ability to do anything technological this includes constructing a sonar device that can scan all 30 million cell phones in gotham city simultaneously or did bruce wayne in his very limited technological training and experience do it either wayok yeah right whatever in bb the stuff fox was selling wayne at least seemed plausible in tdk it comes off as just plain absurd technobabble batman and joker get the crap beat out of them repeatedly chewed up by dogs fall from multiple story buildings and dont even get hurt when batman saved rachel they fell from the penthouse of a chicago high rise for cripes sake that must have been 100 stories easy no bones broken no trauma just ho hum back to business that climactic ferry boat scene is pure de hollywood manipulation it is there solely to reel the viewer in to make it seem like tdk is some kind of original provocative piece instead it comes across as sappy maudlin and empty the ending to that scene is soooooo predictable in general though tdk is choppily edited is populated with one dimensional lifeless characters is humorless convoluted as heck has dull dialogue and is very clich‹© i mean its barely even a decent movie christian bale was great in bb but in tdk nolans hack direction and the script really let him down making him look like a laughingstock as a hero he was barely even in tdk and when he was in it you didnt get any feel for the character so well established in bb what makes bruce wayne batman tick what does he really want just based on one dinner where dent spouts about being a crusader wayne thinks that hes the one the savior of gotham city not very deep character development in addition to freeman you have michael caine as waynes butler accomplice alfred gary oldman as lt gordon and aaron eckhart as harvey dent all giving rather lifeless performances ironically i think eckhart has the biggest male role in the film but unfortunately dent is not very accessible and rather empty to the viewer really bale shares lead honors with oldman eckhart and ledger actually oldman and eckhart may have bigger roles in this than bale and ledger who wants a batman flick where neither batman the main hero nor the joker the main villain have the biggest role these skilled actors are unfortunately operating from a vapid script and extremely short sighted character development tim burtons surrealistic neo noir skewed artsy comic book batman flicks batman and batman returns are truly the best batman movies we accept at face value those films because burtons unique vision not only strived for something different for a superhero movie but also succeeded in a way that nolans films just cannot batman the bad guy who is hated by the entire city of gotham no way not in superhero world not acceptable and i dont care what these nouveau moviegoers so enthralled with this film think
