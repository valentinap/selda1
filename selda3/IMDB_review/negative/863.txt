i went to see rotk for the 2nd time yesterday and aside from the myriad of minor flaws want to concentrate on major issues surrounding jacksons character development aragorn is the first big problem in the book he is both a ranger from the north but also a man destined to be king he knows who he is and he has an expectation of that destiny likewise in the book he has spiritual awareness aragorn is descended not merely from men but from numenor so he already has in him some of the blood of the elves now jackson gives all foresight to the elves making the men merely men but the whole point is that the man born to be king has the spiritual awareness of the great kings of old thus in book ii at the river it is aragorn not legolas as in jacksons version who is aware of a shadow growing in his heart and more significantly it is aragorn who in the book takes the palantir by his right gandalf actually bows to give it to him gandalf counsels him not to use it but aragorn knows who he is so he looks in the palantir and shows sauron the sword he challenges sauron and then wrenches the palantir away from the eye to use as he wills not as sauron wills in so doing he sees the black fleet and so knows the threat thats why he takes the path of the dead and when he goes under the dimholt he really summons the dead the exchange in the film between aragorn and the geoffrey rush pirates of the caribbean look alike ghost is feeble in the film in the book aragorn does not doubt who he is he calls them not barters with them now aragorns action here is part of a much larger cohesion in tolkien that is entirely absent in jackson as a result were left with a desperately anti climactic coronation why theres simply been no character development of aragorn hes been denuded of a sense of who he is sauron is the next big problem its true that in the book he is mostly referred to as the eye but he also has personality in the film apart from the opening sequence to film i which was brilliant all we have is a plasma lamp sometime searchlight since in the book gandalf has told frodo that sauron is taking shape again why on earth didnt jackson then develop sauron from the figure in film i in the book we are told of saurons gnawing doubt we hear of reports about spies entering mordor we know that he is consumed by fear of the upstart heir of elendil none of this is developed in the film and the ring seems to lose power on entering mordor not gain it result there was no sense of elation at the fall of baraddur now this is a serious theological error that i suspect tolkien would have detested personify good and you must also personify evil tolkiens epic was all about those forces being personified and how you discern them sauron is a personification of evil hes not actually the worst that belongs to morgoth of whom the balrog is a servant whilst tolkien rightly loathed allegory he nonetheless never would have countenanced such a weak and ineffectual portrayal of the enemy the whole point and if this isnt obvious in the world today then jackson is even less astute than i imagined is that evil in many guises takes human form others the same lack of characterisation in aragorn and sauron goes on with many of the others notable exceptions are gandalf and saruman both well acted jackson made a mistake in cutting saruman out of iii having made so much of him in i and ii more than the book arwen is drippy throughout eowyn is changed in the film miranda otto was excellent but jackson plays up the love between her and aragorn so much that we are left wondering how eowyn is apparently beatifically happy to see him with arwen on the subject of eowyn its such a shame jackson didnt do the slaying of the witch king better in the book the battlefield pauses a cloud goes up and everyone in minas tirith is happy its one of the truly great moments lost by jackson the reports even leak back to the orcs in the tower above shelobs lair so that sam and frodo hear that no1 has been done in as for the hobbits i think this may be a question of preference personally i think sean astins acting as sam is execrable but some like it for me the simple gardener becomes a mini philosopher and i find his soliloquy both at the end of film ii in osgiliath to which they never go in the book and on the mountain twice truly toe curlingly dreadful pap im afraid and oh dear we even veered towards titanic music moments at the end of film i and again on the mountain bilbo was fine until the end yes we know he ages fast now hes lost the ring but the salieri style prosthetics are poor jackson loves the slow motion work so much that we have to endure some particularly dreadful sequences with the hobbits most notably the already infamous bed scene and at the end where i really thought frodo was going to give sam a full on smacker a similarly tacky piece of directing occurs when the elves appear the soft focus lens is deployed with celtic singing argh this is kindergarten film production i expect the film will garner the oscars ceremony but i hope some people in tinsel town have the courage to acknowledge that whilst some of the visuals are outstanding though many are not eg the oliphaunt descent by legolas the merrick style leader of the orcs and the army of the dead the film is not actually very good peter im afraid youve let us and jrr tolkien down
