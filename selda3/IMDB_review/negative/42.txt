upon seeing the trailer for insurgent i knew straight away the film will be different from the book and i was okay with it if i had known just how much did they butcher the book there would not have been a power on earth strong enough to make me cough up the money for the ticket i cannot even begin to list everything wrong with this movie but i will do my best to point out the highlights the performances there is a reason why i gave 3 stars one is for miles teller he is the only bright spot in the entire mess he is witty funny quick and sharp the other star is for shailene woodley her performance was nowhere near to what she is capable of but i think she did the best she could with the little she got the rest of the cast was a nightmare theo james was so wooden he might just as well not be in the movie at all octavia spencer did not get enough space to introduce herself properly let alone show off her talent and whoever cast naomi watts must have been drunk out of his senses she is a decent actress but she looked like fours ex wife not his mother even kate winslet was repetitive and uninteresting the writers made both jeanine and evelyn into onedimensional clichs and took away anything interesting about them the story the person who wrote the script clearly holds no respect for the authors work or the fans there are whole scenes that were not in the book and the scenes and dialogues crucial for both the plot and character development are not altered  they are missing altogether you cannot even recognise tris from the book her feeling of guilt is spoken of to the point where it bothers you because she becomes whiny and selfabsorbed yet she runs around firing a gun at anything that moves she is presented as the typical chosen one you have seen a thousand times before and there is nothing original about her journey anymore the only thing i have to applaud are the effects the reason for the third star they are truly stunning even though the are deliberately paraded in the scenes that are made out of extremely thin air the use of special effects is a tricky thing if the story is great you do not need a lot of them just enough to create the environment and underline the story however if there is such a severe lack of originality in the screenplay as you can observe here you notice the precise amount and nature of visual wonders and yet they do nothing to improve the overall impression which in this case is that i could have been doing literally anything else and it would not have been such a huge waste of time i do not normally post reviews because they reflect my own opinion but in this case i felt obliged to save someone the pain of seeing their beloved book torn to pieces and prostituted for profit seriously save yourself the pain i cannot so i am hoping for amnesia
