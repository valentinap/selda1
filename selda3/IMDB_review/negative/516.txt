at the time of watching this movie it had a rating of 84 on imdb i normally trust that whatever movie has an 80 rate or more should definitely be a great film well i hope this is the exception that confirms the rule because this movie might be one of the worst i have ever seen why? you must be wondering because of the last 30 minutes up until that point i was really enjoying it generally speaking but man that ending is appalling utterly atrocious and plainly nonsensical a great thriller turned into a love story of pathetic proportions in a matter of minutes the only positive i found at the end was the way they portray the power of media and public opinion in society the rest should go down the garbage shoot in these types of movies theres only one premise keep it real if you do youll have a great film which will improve with every twist and turn you add if you dont keep it real and your thriller becomes too surrealistic youll find yourself going from cleverness and brilliance to false cleverness and stupidity and thats exactly what happened in this film in the last half hour seriously who in their right mind can believe that sequence of events at the end? it had great potential but it is surely one that i will remember for the wrong reasons
