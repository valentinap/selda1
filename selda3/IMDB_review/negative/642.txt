this movie is a well crafted exciting and ultimately thoughtless piece of propaganda like potemkin triumph of the will or birth of a nation it advances certain ideas that we are all slaves to consumerism and have no choice but to buy products advertised to us which we must revolt against by beating people up and exploding buildings and argues them with images rather then words in historical context it will be seen alongside the wto and imf riots and the rise of the green party like most propaganda a closer inspection will reveal how full of hypocrisy it is  notice all the product placements
