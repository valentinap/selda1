nothing we havent seen you already know is about ai so the first 15 minutes resembling robocop or any other futuristic movie are slow with nothing to add to the plot all along the movie you already know whats going to happen there is no twist at all i can summarize it in one sentence ai goes out of control in the most lineal way visual effects are ok but very repetitive there must be at least 10 shots of people healing themselves after getting shot it reminded me of zombie movies i cant understand why guys like bradd pitt with world war z or johnny depp with this movie are taking part in these kinds of productions what a disappointment
