when i was in high school i took a cinema class and the teacher showed the godfather i & ii i personally thought the movie was way too long and way too boring there was just nothing entertaining about this movie not to me any way if you like to watch movies about the mafia then this is the movie for you i dont mind seeing a movie about the mafia and gangs if it is entertaining when i was forced to watch the godfather i & ii in my cinema class i wish i had a pillow to put on my desk so that i could sleep if you every have trouble getting to sleep at night just put the godfather on and you will be asleep in no time
