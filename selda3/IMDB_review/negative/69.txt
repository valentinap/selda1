this movie reminded me a lot about a book by a guy named thien called the dream chip almost too much like thiens book in the dream chip peoples thoughts and memories are uploaded into a super computer hollywood approximated thiens book the dream chip very very closely in the final cut with robin williams maybe thats why the writers guild of america wga has something called the script registry to protect writers from such unscrupulous behaviors by hollywood studios its probably all just a coincidence or why does the writers guild of america wga have something called the script registry? but this movie doesnt have the strength and guts of thiens book titled the dream chip nor did the final cut thiens book has much more guts too many coincidences for me and way too boring one star
