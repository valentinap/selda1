why ill tell you why this is my opinion first of all i cant believe its in top five of all times this is unbelievable and i think even the producer is surprised of the position of his movie im just asking you to think about what major revolutions the movie has brought first of all the story was already used in a previous moviethe lord of the rings 1978 the special effects are great but what about the matrix the music and the costumes are great but this is ordinary for a movie with that budget and the plot is for kidslets face it with no passion or feelings etc just the old war between good and evil witch is present in any jean claude van damme or stallone movie im very sad not because the world is insane about the movie because the movie is in top 5 of all times so they leaving me no chance but to vote the movie with 1
