this movie is not that good after seeing this movie i wouldnt ever pay cash money to see this again i will never rent this movie again i probably wouldnt watch it on tv if it came on its really that bad $350 is not worth watching this movie do not rent it it is awful my reason for this opinion is the fact that it doesnt make sense in most scenes the part where hes burning his hand is fairly impossible the ending is really bad i mean its so bad that i almost threw a flower pot at the tv screen and dont be misled by the title its not really about a fight club its about something more absurd edward norton did the best job he could with this lousy script and even brad pitt did a mediocre job the surprise ending is nothing like the sixth sense id rather see that movie twenty more times rather than see 5 minutes from fight club ive read some comments about this movie and i dont know what you guys are talking about its not that good some plot twists does not make for good movie making this movie is on the level of judge dredd no wait judge dredd isnt this bad
