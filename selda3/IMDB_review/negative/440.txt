i cannot understand how such a capable cast could make such a dog of a movie didnt they read the script before they accepted the roles? the premise of the film is stupid and as such assumes people are stupid add this to the ponderous and boring pace of the movie a bunch of uninteresting characters who are impossible to relate to and a totally predictable and contrived ending on it and you have all the ingredients of a hollywood trainwreck the dvd was described as action this is false advertising what little action there is is about as exciting as watching paint dry the copy i rented had the worst case of bad sound really soft dialogue contrasted with action sounds that almost took the back wall out of my lounge room if i werent so bored maybe i wouldnt have noticed im really glad i didnt pay more than an overnight rental on this but really wish i could have the 2 or so hours of my life i wasted watching this rubbish back
