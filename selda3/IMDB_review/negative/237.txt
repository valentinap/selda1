oh imdb seriously? i trust your ratings and always check before deciding whether to watch or not i was not furious on my money or my time being wasted like that but did anyone ever thought giving 8+ ratings would put this movie in the league of godfather the shawshank redemption the lord of the ring series goodfellas star wars and likes its utter disrespect and blasphemous for these great movies to put this good for nothing movie and listed and counted among them to praise boyhood as a masterpiece is actually a slap in the face of all those directors who put a real effort into creating works of art that have real value just because you took 12 years filming this doesnt mean you get to get a 99% rt and an 84 imdb without deserving it okay let me see what was this movie about? nothing 12 freaking years of shooting for what? what really happened there? first of all there was no plot no story whatsoever it shows look a boy was 9 playing with his sister fighting with his sister eating macaroni going to bathroom he got taller grew his hair he cut them back grew them again hes eating going to bathroom again drinking kissing a girl breaking up with a girl going to college oh come on thats what kids do they grow up right? the film which is much too long follows an unstable family and focuses on the life of mason a character that has absolutely no interesting characteristics whatsoever hes not a hero not a zero not a lover not a loser not a fighter not even a dreamer theres nothing about this character that will pause you and let you think about it mr linklater couldnt even catch any memorable scene out of it i appreciate his movie shooting technique but there should be more of it since boyhood supposed to be a story about a boys life his inner world his feelings his dream or his struggle growing up his happinesssadness but there is no depth at all for instance i was once a kid now im grown up i saw my life then how my times were my thoughts my actions my dreams etc it could have been like mason as boy how were his thoughts by the time he was growing up what changes he had to face in his adulthood how he struggled or how he enjoyed what was his dream how he adapted with his struggling family instead mr linklater showed some ordinary does not mean they needs to be extraordinary folks leading lives where nothing happened at all this is a not a growing up story this is certainly not a movie about teenage crisis in fact this movie is about nothing so thats the point? call this 12yearsgimmick a masterpiece? oh come on give me a break
