there is no way on earth that these positive reviews are real this was hands down the worst movie experience of my life it made shark boy and lava girl seem like a masterpiece both of these movies were seen at the urging of the same sonalbeit almost a decade apart i cannot believe i ruined date night with my wife over this 3 hour hellfest i alternated between scratching my head holding back laughing wanting to yell out jokes about lincoln commercials and not being able to hold back laughing based on the looks from everyone else as they were leaving the theater we all shared the same sentiments go ahead blow $10 on this miserable ridiculous implausible pile of poopy that would make m night shamalyan scream out you have got to be friggin kidding me at the movies attempts at plot twists
