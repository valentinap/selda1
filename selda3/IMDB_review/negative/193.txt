seriously? some people are rating this 10? im no physicist but i do have a basic understanding of what is within the realms of possibility firstly the first line of the synopsis of this film on imdb scarcity of food on planet earth due to drought and famine? what? sorrybut no on our planet we are currently storing seeds in a massive archive from countries all over the world even north korea theyre being stored underground and kept at a very low temperature also we can grow vegetation without sunlight there are many people doing this today so why if for any reason would we be risking our crops to this unexplained environment? this is just the first problem i have with this film at no point was it explained of what the cause of this global famine was i want to know and i waited for 3 hours for an explanation that never came secondly forgoing the wormhole if gravity is that strong to slow down time youd be crushed and waves wouldnt even exist let alone 100 foot waves thirdly the robot why oh why is it a box that seemingly can move over any terrain? throughout the film the same joke humour level at 75%? sarcasm rating at 80%? oh yes these jokes came thick and fast the only joke i could see is that this film was actually made and i wasted 3 hours of my life if you want to watch a brilliant sci fi with matthew maconaghy watch contact it was made in 1997 and was written by the famous cosmologist carl sagan now thats worthy of a 10 the only good point about interstellar was the visuals married to the brilliant soundtrack if you want that then go to a light show or concert sad to say im greatly disappointed nolan should stick with bat man
