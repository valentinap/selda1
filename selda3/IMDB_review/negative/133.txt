the script is predictable and badly executed acting is lame the trailer is misleading the characters and the plot did not click with me at all the cgi effects are awful not believable there in logic in the movie it is more like zombie movie if you want to see something nice with a nice sense of humor and the actual interesting plot then please do not watch this you will definitely be wasting your time what you get here is that you know the end of the first 5 minutes i mean come on the fight will be accepted in high society and movies about it was a hit 30 years ago if you have the money or you are a smart man you will be welcomed throughout the world this is really poor movie avoid this crap
