this is a formal request to matt damon matthew mccougnehey christopher nolan and the rest of the people behind this movie to give me three hours of my life back i warn anyone that is considering to watch this movie dont this movie is riddled with plot holes a storyline that is so formulaic and predictable that it borders on something a 5th grader could have wrote if you watch the first 20 minutes of the movie the rest of the movie you will just be waiting for the stuff that you know will happen to happen there is little room for surprise and even less room for enjoyment adding to this the visuals in the movie are a huge problem in watching it i got a headache and motion sickness so not only was i left with a feeling of wasted time after leaving the cinema i also felt physically ill i feel the actors in this movie are all outside their comfort zones and the acting feels very forced and it feels like not even the actors in the movie want to be a part of it i would recommend this movie to anyone that enjoyed the room with tommy wiseau or gigli with ben affleck and jennifer lopez because i think we have a new winner in the unwatchable movie hall of fame interstellar
