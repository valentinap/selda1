i just an advanced screening of this movie and felt i had to write about it i expected so much from this director wally pfister and cast and i just feel so let down it seems this movie is meant to be a pure scifi with a great message at its heart but it just wasnt good points it has a great cast it looks great good cinematography the cgi was a good standard but not mind blowing bad points major plot holesits also very dull i can usually take the mrs into a scifi movie and although she wont enjoy it on the same level i would she would be able to sit through it good thing i watched it on my own as she would not be able to stomach this in fact i was seriously bored there are no sub plots there are no twists and turns in fact not much happened ********* this part of the review contains major spoilers ***************** there is no real explanation of how they upload the mind of the main scientist  other than some reference to a monkey brain that another scientist managed to achieve then there is the whole building of an entire datacentre  the one the size of a small city underground by a contractor who seems to only have experience in building cafes and houses why does the government not notice that an entire town has been taken over? once the nanites are everywhere why not just infect the whole world? why does the ai not just suicide itself instead of allowing itself to be infected? then there is the idea that max writes a virus to destroy the ai that was created  exactly how does this man out wit the greatest intelligence in the history of the world? how does max infect evelyn? just because max works in ai how does that mean he could write this amazing virus into a human being? ok maybe i am a little biased i have a degree in computer science and i work as full time software developer so maybe i know a bit too much but still **** end of spoilers ****** the entire movie felt flat on its face it invoked no emotion whatsoever there was no wow moment there was no edge of your seat thriller it was a dull scifi movie with a big budget and a great cast i love scifi and thrillers and i am a huge chris nolan fan so i had high hopes for this also please mr pfister go back to doing cinematography with chris nolan
