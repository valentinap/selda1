 you people are so comic it makes me batty is it a good movieyes was it a brilliantly imagined and epic series of filmsyes was it one of the best 50 films of all timenot a chance in hell i dont care if you 15 year olds want to live in fantasy land the rest of your lives but spare us from this lotr are the best movies ever crap we dont need to hear it and it makes us laugh it was a great series to watch but when you come on here and disrespect the film greats of all time and have any of these lotr movies in the top 100 it disrespects the entire film industry if you want to play fantasy time then go on a disney board and post away but do us all a favor and leave the imdb for real movies
