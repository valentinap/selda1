two years ago when i heard that disney was going to focus their energy on making liveaction reimaginings of many of their classic animated films i rolled my eyes and thought why would they waste their resources telling us stories that we already know? considering some of the really smart and creative animated films that theyve turned out in the past decade such as tangled 2010 and wreckitralph 2012 it seems like they should be working on more of those on top of that i was quite disappointed with last years spinoff of sleeping beauty maleficent so when i heard that they were indeed planning to keep the trend going with cinderella i was like and so it continues *sigh* however when the trailer came out except for some obvious overthetop cgi effects it didnt look too bad so i decided to make the trip to the theatre yesterday and see it whats the final verdict? well apart from some quite nicelooking sets and costumes disney has once again made another cgiladen cashgrab where its obvious they spent more time and money on how the film looks rather than how the story is executed it seems pointless to summarize the story seeing as its one everybody knows so ill just get right to talking about where the film falls flat its biggest flaw is that while its clear that the writers tried to give some development to the characters by extending their roles andor giving them more interaction with each other but none of it ever lasts for more than a few minutes for example they have cinderella and the prince meet in the forest before the ball in order to try and give them some believable chemistry but the conversation they have only lasts for about ten minutes so it comes off as rather odd when the prince is raving about her and insisting that she come to the ball the next scene similarly we get a subplot near the end that involves the wicked stepmother making a deal with the grand duke that if he keeps quiet about cinderella and raises both her and her daughters statuses she will reward him however the duke almost never speaks in any of his previous scenes so we never get any indication as to why he would betray the prince as he does also there is something that happens near the end of the film which i will not reveal in case you havent seen the movie but its something major that comes completely out of left field and doesnt move the plot forward in any way so its completely pointless the movie also fails in how it constantly tries to show off the lavishlydecorated sets and expensive cgi effects at every turn while they do look nice as i already said they often shove their cgi creatures right into the camera and even have some shots where they zoom in on specific pieces of the set when really they should be focusing on the characters cinderella has really turned me off to all future liveaction reimaginings that disney may come out with if i have to ill get down on my hands and knees and say please please pleeeeease go back to making original content again
