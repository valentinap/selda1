no1 movie of all time i think thats what ruined it for me i sat down expecting to watch the most spectacular cinematic experience of my life but instead i ended up sitting rather bored for the good part of 3hours everything about it just lacked in moving me the vengeance was untouched parts of the story seemed to obvious and other parts just left untouched thoroughly this was the most disappointing film ive ever seen not the worst just the most disappointing im not trying to change anyones thoughts on the film or make out the film is bad just in case anyone gets the impression thanks
