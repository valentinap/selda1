chuck pallanick is a real piece of worst writing ever existing on this planet this is one fact admit it the fight club flick is a real decent screening of his terribly writing on to a silver screen this is the worst film of all time in all instances in all possible scenarios point no arguing here nothing simply nothing in this unimaginable horrific piece of manure gives any redeeming feature or any clue dirt mud muck slime blood vapid acting hollowness emptiness nihilism and a total waste of 120 minutes just terrible it is so edward norton gives a weak delivery brad pitt does not help too and helena bonham carter is simply awful this is the keyword  awful the whole finchers flick is just awful mess rating  must be minus 1000 but here 1 the worst
