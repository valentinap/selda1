what is the problem with hollywood and infatuation with british accent one can hardly understand most of the movie angelina pretends to have the accent the three fairies hardly can speak english and the main guy character was so hard to understand that i walked off the movie please announce if you are going to use british accent in movies so many of us would not waste hard earned $$ the movie is predictable the director has spoiled angelinas beauty and there was nothing in the movie that kept my interest we watched the movie in 3d and that is even more waste of money as there were no great special effects worth watching in 3d
