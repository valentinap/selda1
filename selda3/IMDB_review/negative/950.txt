 quite possibly the most over rated film in history never has there been so much made of so little it is an ok movie if you like discriminate killing and foul language and the glorification of gang lifestyle this movie hardly belongs in the top 50 let alone be in the #1 spot do you know what the saddest part of this movie is that it was remade two more times with the godfather iii being quite possible the worst remake ever im not saying you wont like the movie it is entertaining at times and certainly some very good lines have come from the movie i just cant stand when movies cant stand up to their own hype
