i liked this film and all but does anyone really think this film is better than lord of the rings come on its surprising how many people supposedly love this film yet can only put up the defense that it was well acted a few mumblings here and there do not good acting make and the attention to detail argument its so detailed exactly as that era so what lord of the rings brought to life a fantasy land far more challenging than 1940s new york
