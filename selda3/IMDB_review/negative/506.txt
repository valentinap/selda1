can i have the 25 hours of my life back? there is no closure to this movie they ruined it with the ending imho what were the producers and directors thinking a long and very drawn out movie and then to get to the end and leaving the audience hanging it reminds me of one the lord of the rings movies where they just suddenly and abruptly end the movie except this one is much worse since there will be no sequel my wife and i had a debate whether the wife was attractive or not i thought so at the beginning of the movie and not so much later my wife thought that she was not attractive at all i hope this review is beneficial and will save someone time and money
