that could possibly describe what this movie is awful i know most of you will disagree with me but sorry it sucked first off there is no acting in this movie you could put any actors in place of brad and edward and it would be the same but in my opinion neither of them should never win an oscar anyway for any of their works second what was going on i mean i get the story of edward trying to be someone else and all but it was told well at all it was a very dark movie saying this is the best movie of all time makes me laugh there is no way it can be if you want to argue about this let me know fight club = f
