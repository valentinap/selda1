yes this movie is quite different however aside from the possibility that no ones done it before because they werent smartinspiredgood enough to theres also the other one this is a movie that fails so remarkably you almost have to be a genius to come up with such a failure in the one excellent scene in this movie edward norton flying on a plane from one of his constant business trips cracks a joke to his neighbour brad pitt aka tyler durden here very clever pitt replies how is that going for you that is both funny and poignant the rest of the movie however is neither in fact its just the same as poor ed norton  too clever for its own good worse yet is the reaction this movie seems to cause many of the others commented and other people whove seen this movie think that tyler durden is somehow the voice of good a positive role model if you will and some people are completely nuts about this movie they quote it day and night and i dont know its just weird and then theres the ending i cant give it away but the best thing that i can say about it is that it is gimmicky its also pretty implausible doesnt fit with the rest of the story and involves blowing up skyscrapers something we now know is not a very good idea if youre going to make a clever movie with a clever surprise ending fine its possible to make a good one  the usual suspects for example but having a clever movie that isnt clever enough to make sure the movie still makes any sense when the ending is revealed a clever movie whose message is how empty cleverness is a clever message movie where the message is delivered by someone whos obviously shall we say not very emotionallymentally stable to say the least i guess you could say its irony but then with the same success you can say that domestic disturbance is a movie that makes one think cause it makes you think what the heck youre doing watchingpaying for such an awful movie having said all that this is a movie that could have been partially rescued by having a lead actress who is stunningly beautiful unfortunately helena bonham carter isnt okay maybe its not the most overrated movie on imdb  after all the shwshank redemption is ranked #2 and kingpin is not even on the bottom 100 at all but its pretty close 110 and that high only cause it took so much effort
