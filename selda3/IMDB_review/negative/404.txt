i just recently watched the series from beginning to the present episodes such promise the show has slowly deteriorated into a scifi soap opera to oliver thea is not really your sister shes your half sister from a man your mother had an affair with whom she now hates or hated because she is now dead or is she? that man is dead now or was dead and is now training your half sister to be a killer why did she stop hating him? oh and the love of her life roy is being replaced by a dj olivers main concern is bedding every female in the cast while those around him slowly find out who he really is the whole show reminds me of the heroes series because it seems that week to week they dont know where the story is going so they change things at the drop of a hat and hope people go along with it
