okay lets make this simple this is perhaps the worst movie ever made it is more than predictable it so lacks originality that i not only figured out what was going to happen throughout the entire movie less than 10 minutes into it i even could tell you the lines of each character before they spoke them the highly touted fx? they were average at best and considering the budget of this film they could have been infinitely better the acting editing and cinematography were far from cutting edge the best part of this filmthat it ends but not nearly soon enough your best bet skip this movie watch the miniature golf tournament on espn2 instead
