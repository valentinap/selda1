the movie was based on a very bad book with a horrible language and style its no secret that the movie is better than the book but it doesnt make it good the story that turns violent ruthless criminals into men of honor and the horrible world of crime into something beautiful and almost royal its unnecessarily violent and why did brando put paper towel in his mouth i mean i like him as an actor but this character is absolutely ridiculous i dont understand how anyone could give an oscar for that film its just stupid
