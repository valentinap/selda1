one of the most ridiculous spectacles of bad storytelling i have ever seen in my entire life gone girl gets its title i think from the fact that she was supposed to be done away with murdered and disposed of but is really gone psychologically‹she is a pure psychopath the movie tries to tell you that she is highly intelligent and meticulously plans to fake her own murder and frame her husband for it heres the pathetic execution of her plan 1 he leaves the house one morning and she springs into action 2 she breaks the glass coffee table pours about a half quart of her own blood in one puddle in front of the kitchen sink that much blood from a violent attack would be all over the room 3 she flees leaving the front door open 4 a nosy neighbor notices the door ajar and calls the husband somehow the neighbor knows exactly where he is but no one saw the wife leave 5 the husband comes home he has not a scratch on him 6 he is totally cooperative with the police 7 they eventually find her diary in a wood stove at the husbands fathers house the wood stove door is ajar and the diary is only partially burned it really makes you wonder how that played out‹that the husband put the diary in there to burn but just left it singed all that work cleaning up the blood at home but not to burn the book as if he needed to make a special trip to his dads house to dispose of a stupid book and the only thing incriminating that she wrote was on one page which he couldve simply torn out 8 when the wife runs away she only changes her appearance slightly and then instead of secluding herself she makes friends with some lowlifes with whom she sits and watches her story unfold on tv 9 she murders the neil harris character in an attempt to switch the blame to him that would then imply he was the one that drained so much blood from her back at her home he cleaned it up and he put her diary in the wood stove ? his car wasnt seen at her house he then kept her a prisoner starved and raped heryet she found the opportunity and strength to kill him but didnt call the police from his house to come rescue her rather she jumps in his car and drives all the way home 10 upon returning home she has no wounds consistent with the bloodletting at her original house or at the hands of her alleged kidnapper 11 there is no visit to or investigation of the alleged kidnapping crime scene‹house on the lake 12 the hospital sends her home in a nurses uniform underneath which she is still caked in blood this movie is just about the lamest piece of s**** i have ever seen
