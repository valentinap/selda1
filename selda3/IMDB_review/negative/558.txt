as an earlier comment stated the first 23rds of this movie are truly intriguing the visuals are slick but not in you blademeetsmortalkombat kinda way instead focusing on delivering irony sarcasm and black jokes through flawless direction and edition  and even some hi tech effects like when the credits roll edward norton plays the narrator and the social satire presented during the first half of the flic is simply put awesome because the movie doesnt seem to take itself too seriously  althought it is serious  one plus point is the fact that the narrator doesnt step on a soapbox to preach and condemn he justnarrates and observes however after the first half of the movie is over it suddenly dulls and painfully slows down from the pace from which it begun for starters the attention to detail lowers the dialogues start to dumb down you get this anything can happen now no matter how far fetched feeling and plain and simple it just gets silly as in 6th sense another recent movie there a shocking twist near the end but instead of leaving you gasping for air like in the former here it all seems contrived forced it just doesnt fit all in all fight club is not a bad movie but i really wished it had ended as good as it started
