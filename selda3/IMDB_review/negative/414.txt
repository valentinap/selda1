i hated the movie because the end is creepy and weird that she kisses her on the bed while shes dead and then she wakes because it was true love kiss makes me think that she wants to say that there is no true love at all between women and men and that true love only lies between women and women that is kind of gay and pathetic and sick i am very disappointed in the movie  maybe the next movie for disney would be about a love story between two lesbians hows that ? prince phillip used to be my favorite disney prince but here i guess hes just another tool used by feminists to shove their message down our throats
