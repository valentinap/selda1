the first two acts carried the movie brilliantly ive never laughed harder at more one word dialog lines the action was incredible and the actingsublime some of britains best leading men are on display and their charm and wit are matched only by the twinkling glee that all this is delivered with tonguefirmlyincheek and then they threw it all away in the third act what a disaster witty banter replaced with cannedcatchphrases charm replaced with scatological nonsense incredible stunts replaced with the same tired line work that grew old during the third matrix movie many movies disappoint because they never rise this movie disappoints by how close it came to being truly incredible want to know when to leave? leave when colin firth is out of the picture up to that point its a fun ride but frankly the whole picture hits an iceberg and sinks deep into the abyss after that smug cocky and secondrate the picture becomes a model of the protagonist before making his journey one is left hoping that the entire affair does not spawn a sequel
