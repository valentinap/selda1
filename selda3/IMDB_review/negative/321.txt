im always excited to see movies that arent what most people consider your average already done hollywood blockbuster but this was so awful i had to write just how much i disagree with all the praise this movie has gotten the idea of filming a boys transition to manhood over 12 years of actual time sounds like a fantastic idea but im afraid that is really all this movie has going for it we follow the main character through his childhood and teenage years i dont know about you but at least for me those were the most exciting and sometimes heartbreaking times of my life i cant really say why the director didnt want to show any of masons truly pivotal moments or his true emotions he just shows us the truly mundane moments and expects us to be amazed at his originality sorry i wasnt in fact i was quite bored mason mostly sleep walks through the whole movie no real emotion about anything happening in his life sure he cracks a smile now and again nothing like the true rollercoaster that is life the other people in masons life are about uninteresting and one dimensional as he is this movie is a one trick pony that doesnt even do that one trick well critics have praised this to the hilt which convinced me to see it i sometimes disagree with critics but have never felt as opposed to them as i do about this film if you can sit through this absolute snooze fest twice you really should get out more
