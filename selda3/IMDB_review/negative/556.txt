also one of the 10 worst films of all time are we sure ed wood is dead because i swear he must have written cast and directed this major turkey if people claim not to understand this film its merely because they have an iq of 3 i even read one critique by someone who watches this bomb every week talk about not having a life there was a half hour episode of alfred hitchcocks series that had the same plot and was 100 times better than this as to the acting well i couldnt find anyone doing that here but then ed norton is one of the worst actors alive today as is pitt so you shouldnt be surprised there meatloaf was the only person even trying but then he was saddled with an incredibly moronic script written by a 2 year old
