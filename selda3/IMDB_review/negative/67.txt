this movie was a complete waste of money and time the supposed rape scene was nothing more than a greedy human being tearing off the limbs of an angel the ending of the movie was completely absurd thank you disney my six year old daughter was heartbroken and crying thanks you ending daddy daddy does this mean true love doesnt exist? of course it does what were you trying to pull with this ending?? my daughter deserved better than some sick twisted fairytale i trusted you disney this is the first movie your company has ever done where it portrays gruesome fighting and killing plus you destroyed any ideas about love and romance in review i thought the movie deserved at least a 410 but my daughter wants me to say 110 so here you go disney 110
