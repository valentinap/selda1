never posted on imdb before and i never thought i would but this time i had to i am a movie buff watched thousands of films and i love it i was looking forward to this movie great reviews and 84 on imdb i never read reviews listen to my friends or ever watch trailers because i like going in with a clean slate thats when ive had my best film experiences try it this movie is garbage i love finchers work but he failed miserably at this one so the movie starts out as an interesting dramathriller with the usual effects then it turns over to black comedysatire with the same direction?? i couldnt believe the last third ive never seen this many plot holes in any movie unbelievable garbage
