i wasted $650 tonight seeing fight club i plan on returning to the theatre tomorrow and requesting a refund from the manager because i do not want my dollars supporting such a movie i would call it a film but it does not deserve such an honor the best way i can describe this movie is to say that i came away from it feeling visually and mentally raped it was thoroughly violent but violence is not what offended me most the violence for violence sake offended me the pointlessness of the movie offended me the god hates you dialogue offended me i was glad to see that 2 other people had already agreed with me and given the movie a rating of 1 do not waste your money on this movie do not waste your time on this movie brad pitt fans  resist the urge to see this attack on your selfworth and intelligence i could go on but you get the picture fight club  stay away
