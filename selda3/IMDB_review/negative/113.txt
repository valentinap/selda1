this film glorifies sodomy it mentions global warming as if its a real thing it implies strongly that margaret thatcher was not a positive political figure it portrays christians as lunatics worthy of slaughter the foul language is so gratuitous that one has to wonder if the filmmakers think its clever or what point it is theyre trying to make by taking that road there are no heroes or any sort of virtuous characters to latch onto the plot is full of holes i could go on but suffice it to say that this is lowgrade filmmaking and a waste of everyones time my wife and i both disliked it and wish we had our afternoon back
