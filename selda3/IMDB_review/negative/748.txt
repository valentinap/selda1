 holy smokes this has got to be one of the most pointless trilogies ive ever seen i do not even know how it scored this high there was nothing that made it stand out at all throughout the 9 excruciating hours of watching frodo turn into a mentally disoriented fool i cannot recount a single moment in time where i said wow thats interesting first off the plot is simply unenjoyable it has no twist no character building and for gods sake its about a possessive ring watching the characters go through pointless trials to burn a single ring is not something i can find appealing in fact i was ready to watch any of these uptight hobbits meet their end that is a huge problem in this series not one character was tragically killed in the midst of any orc battle ok there was that no name in the fellowship of the ring but the audience didnt give a damn as to what was going on with him what made me even more angry was that these fools looked almost invincible when legolas and gimli were slaying orcs left and right as easily as brushing snowflakes away i was ready to step out of the theater i can see why people liked this movie the action was indeed thrilling and had great deal of special effects thrown into it i remember legolas first arrow being launched smoothly into an orc what a marvelous scene then i looked and he was launching another arrow in a similar fashion then another one and another one sure it looked great but it was so repetitive i got bored every battle in this movie is almost exactly the same swords swinging arrows launching and people screaming i just cant see what was so special about it i also could not get through my head the final battle scene honestly an army of the undead destroying the orc forces gee that must have been a difficult victory it was so predictable and unfair i simply hated this movie for all of the action attempts and turning a really old trilogy into a movie i was considering giving this film two stars but then i remembered the conclusion frodo and sam were being saved by a bunch of hawks or something and everything seemed to be at peace not a bad ending then the story stretches into farewells and goodbyes good luck and god bless ok i can tolerate this now bilbo is going into a boat and heading off to god knows where when is this bloody movie going to end by the time i got out of the theater it was nearly half an hour after the part where the movie would have made an effective conclusion my behind sweating like an oxen from boredom i would definitely not recommend this movie to anyone unless you are amazed by a couple of special effects i dont know how this movie did so well i think one critic said it was a good movie and it spread like wildfire or maybe there was simply nothing else to do but worship elves whatever the reason i do not want to see this ever again
