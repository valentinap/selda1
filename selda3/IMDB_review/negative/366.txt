i usually love slow burning character driven movies where the plot moves at a pace that dictates character development and depth then i realised that there was still over 1 hour to goand nothing had happenedand nothing looks like it will happen and i dont care what happens just make it stop so i didi stopped watching now i am relieved because moments agoi turned into peter finch and began raving im mad as hell and im not going to take this anymore im mad as hell and im not going to take this anymore im mad as hell and im not going to take this anymore what is the point of this dribble mascaraing as a movie i dont care what happens to the boy the mom the sister or that dad i am not wasting one more precious second on this meaningless reality fantasy pretending to be interesting or clever or arty i hated this
