 after reading all the rave reviews for this movie it turned out to be a real disappointment can anyone really believe that the prisoners are honourable men while the guards and warden are all crooks havent we overdone the hypocritical bible thumper  lets find a more enlightened characterization james bond himself could not have followed the main characters escape plan the ending soliloquy and denouement were inferior plagiarisms from cool hand luke enough unfortunately fine performances by both robbins and freeman were wasted in this fantasy story
