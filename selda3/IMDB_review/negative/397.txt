i love scifi thrillers and all i hated this one there is something fundamentally wrong with this movie the story reads as an excuse an excuse to keep you in a room and play some space flight scenes the film tried so much that ended up failing in everything i think the problem is the blend of emotional crap with bandaid surrealistic physics that makes no sense just so that emotion could be the focus of this crap movie i would really like to convey my opinion but this movie only left 2 brain cells properly working it is that bad i sincerely hope i make it i have been drooling ever since i left the cinema
