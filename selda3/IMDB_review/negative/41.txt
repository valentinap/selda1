very simple very short the movie is a complete drama i saw the trailers and all of them made the movie appear to be scientific but it is just confusing and filled with speculation i really am getting annoyed with how new movies are all starting to pretend that man is something more like lucy all are disappointing movies and the only parts i really enjoyed was when they showed space like the last few minutes of lucy and the few minutes in interstellar showing the wormholeblackhole etc why do you insist on turning movies into an art? all those who said this movie was great your reviews are really confusing to me how can this be a masterpiece when 95% of the movie was complete drama and a waste of time? if you will make a movie called interstellar i expect to see a 25 hour movie filled with speculation and knowledge about things such as a singularity or a blackhole why waste time talking and docking and other things? just zoom out and let us stare at the blackhole that is the sole reason i watched this movie and the sole reason i created an account here next time change it to dramacomplete drama dont take a name like interstellar and make it into complete nonsense we want to see science we want to see you analyze the blackhole and the wormhole completely low budget stuff were put in this film docking looked fake by the way i am extremely outraged at how fake this movie seemed thank you
