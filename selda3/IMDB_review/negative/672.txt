this film won 11 oscars including best picture the return of the king is an awful film at well over three hours it is an exercise in boredom orlando bloom and viggo moretensen are completely miscast the story does not make sense and the characters are contrived it is like playing a bad video game so many actors are wasted in this colassal disaster peter jackson winner of the best director academy award seems as though he thought that his film was too precious to edit the film goes on and on and on weak acting all around the film relies on special effects to cover for a script that is completely pretentious the musical score is like listening to someone scratching a chalkboard
