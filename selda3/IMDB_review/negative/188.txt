so the only selling point of this movie is that it was filmed over 12 years wow yeah crazy you know what else happened over a period of 12 years? lots of nothing to lots of other people just like in this movie in which nothing freaking happens 12 years and this is what they came up with? for crying out loud this movie is less interesting than watching paint dry in the middle of an arkansas corn field for 12 years maybe my lifes so much more interesting than everyone elses who gave this movie rave reviews are people so boring that its now cool to pay to watch nothing happen on a screen? and the guy is gay didnt anyone else notice that? ive nothing against gay people but were supposed to believe hes straight come on if thatd been acknowledged at least there might have been something interesting there look hes finally coming out of the closet shocker and what did these people have against hair brushes? maybe its too much excitement to brush your hair and it might have given the movie an air of something actually happening a hint of not so awfullyboringwhygoddidiagreetowatchthis? i want a refund
