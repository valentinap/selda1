i must echo the sentiments of many of the other negative reviewers the movie moved into emotional elements of the characters without developing the characters i felt nothing for the characters and i really wanted to there were a few moments when i was interested enough to see how the makers were going to present some of the physics based elements but nobodynothing got spaghettafied neil degrasse tysons descriptionterm it is really a love story disguised as a scifi fantasy and not even a very good love story i was so bored i fell asleep for about 15 minutes i felt like just getting up and leaving so many times but i thought maybe if i stayed it would get better it didnt i really hoped that the actors starring in the movie could make it better they tried but it didnt help can i get my money back? how many millions of people could they have fed for the money they wasted making this movie? they could make it up to me if they donated the money they made from this movie to feed the poor in this country
