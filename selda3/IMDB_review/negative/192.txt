should not be called a disney film  the original was fine angelina jolie was better in changeling a much more believable and oscarworthy role several of the actors did a bad job the guy playing the king was especially horrible elle fanning was annoying with her widerimmed smile they turned the three fairies everyone loved into completely hideous idiots bordering on child abuse almost all the characters were onedimensional and uninteresting and how was it that aurora didnt cry when her father died? why didnt anyone see the one of the magical trees at the beginning of the film totally resemble the balrog from fellowship of the ring??? ugh i wish this film could be erased from existence 210  a 2 for the nice effects but the story is overall badly flawed and tries with unsuccessful efforts to shatter categories
