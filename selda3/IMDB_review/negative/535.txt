after 30 minutes you are still not interested the 30 minute time frame is the cutoff for interest the lines in the movie are so idiotic that a three year old could have written them i think people that wrote good reviews actually were getting paid to do it my wife likes chic flics but this one is so stupid and the dialogue is so stupid that only an idiot could like it the scenes are ridiculous the police in the story are stupid and do not act like police the main character which happens to be ben aflec of should i say aflac is searching for clues that his wife left after she disappeared and how can i say how bad the script is it is for an emotional response from women men do yourself a favor and do not watch
