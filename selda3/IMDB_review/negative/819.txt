 ok now i was a big fan of batman begins i really liked it but it wasnt really my favourite movie ever and the same can be said for the dark knight first of all whilst the joker was an interesting character and very well written to be honest i dont see what everyone is raving about yes heath was amazing but it gets me thinking was this due to the script or heaths ability to understand and become a phycopath if it really is the second should we applaud it did it live up too all the hype is heath the only reason people went to see it is it the best film of the year the answer to all these is of courseno and i dont understand why everyone is treating it like a god omg it was so amazing best movie of the year you see people this type of person is called a hype hound by the way thats copy written =] a person who bases there sole judgement on the hype surrounding a film and the first few reviews thats not to say there arent some true fans who really did love the movie but im sick of the pretenders giving it tens when they didnt even like it conformity is for those who cant think of there own free will free will is for those who break through conformity anyways guys my final words is a great movie but not the greatest will heath win an oscar yes will it win best picture well lets just see
