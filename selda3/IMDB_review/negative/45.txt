trying to remember this is public series started as u would expectand just went downwards there is so much to put the finger onso im just gonna stick to season 3 whats came out anyway question 1 why does oliver arrow behave like hes the only one that have been hurtcan cope with it? 2 why does oliverarrow still mean and enforce that im gonna spare his life no matter whateven though that very same person is responsible for the deaths of several thousand people that we know of in the seriesbut hey he got to make out++ with a few girls before they diedso conclusion series started out promisingbut hollywood decided to please people to much againmaking it to a lovestory and marvelheroes aint made for such thing
