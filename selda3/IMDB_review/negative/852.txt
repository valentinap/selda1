there are some things in this life we will never understand how did the universe begin what happens to our souls when we die how did a movie as bland as the shawshank redemption become so overrated in the case of certain other movies i can at least understand the reasons why theyre overrated but the shawshank redemption is so average and clich‹© ridden the films moral is basically that hope is important and theres nothing wrong with that in itself heck i have no problem with simplicity the problem is when you move past the simple and into the land of the simplistic the movie treats its borrowed plot parts count of monte cristo anyone and banal themes as though they were freshly minted nuggets of wisdom i wouldnt be complaining if it didnt pretend to be anything more than a pleasant diversion however it is with its very last shot that the movie reveals its true condescending colours if it had ended moments earlier instead with that poetic shot of the sea i would have had some respect for it thats where the superior original story ends but no the director had to spell things out for his audience frank darabont knows how to tell a story he just doesnt know how to tell one with any originality or depth the movie is partially redeemed by three things the majestic cinematography the powerful score and most of all morgan freeman one of the very best actors working today as for my rating yes im one of those jerks who gives a movie a 1 just to lower it on the top 250 i think its outrageous how highly its ranked here even the folks who made it would think its ridiculous to consider it one of the greatest films ever made
