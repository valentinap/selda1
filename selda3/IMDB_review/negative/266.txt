like many other reviewers im giving this a 1 in a feeble attempt to balance out all the unwarranted 10s i keep seeing even though i really think it deserves a 5 or maybe a 6 i actually created an account just to do this so i figured i might as well include a review along with my rating many will say try to tell you that you shouldnt attempt to compare this movie to 2001 that they are two totally different movies etc this is ridiculous they are quite similar on multiple levels with interstellar obviously taking many cues and inspirations from kubricks masterpiece i feel that if we compare the two we can get a good idea of where nolans film went wrong the main reason 2001 has remained so powerful and held up so well is that it doesnt try to explain and rationalize everything that happens we see the events of the movie unfold but as the movie nears its psychedelic conclusion we are really left to our own guesswork as to what is going on has he entered another dimension? an alternate universe? an alien spacecraft? is he just dead? the mere fact that we have no idea whether this scene depicts something spiritual something scientifically quantifiable or a mix of the two makes it so much more moving than if kubrick had tried to explain it through the available science of his time interstellar answers far too many questions which as is often the case ends up raising infinitely more nolan makes it clear from the get go that this film is supposed to function on more of an emotional level than a scientific one then why even bother have the film fact checked by a astrophysicist? why create this confusing mixture of real and pseudo science in the first place? to me in a lot of scenes this kind of shatters the air of mysticism nolan seemed to be going for the floating bookcase in a black hole sequence for instance seemed really magical until cooper suddenly has a bunch of epiphanies and becomes positive that the structure was created by future humans not aliens that they created it specifically for him so he could navigate 5d and communicate with his daughter and that he can save the world only by manipulating a watch with gravity boom there goes all the mystery and lets assume his theory is correct and this structure was indeed constructed by mankind from the future hmmm guess it turns out that we didnt perish from constant dust storms after all‹instead we survived hundreds of thousands of years into the future and went on to create mindblowing interdimensional space technology then what exactly is future us so worried about? they seem to be doing just fine without any alteration of the past this is just the tip of the iceberg as far as far as all of the inconsistencies and unanswered questions youll find in this movie if you have a very analytical mind steer clear of it‹i am not a mathy or sciencey person by any stretch yet even i struggled at times to put my logic in the backseat and just enjoy the ride thats what id advise you to do if you want to have a good time watching this movie dont overthink it if you can just do that youll find an entertaining film with truly stunning visual effects a great if maybe a little too over the top score from hz and very convincing performances from the actors i found some scenes very moving i liked the concept of a future that as a result of a technological lull doesnt look very different from our present there are a lot of positive things to say about this film and yet the end result is sadly maybe just a couple pegs above mediocre
