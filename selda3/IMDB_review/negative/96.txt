this is one of the worst films in recent memory everything about it was terrible the score the acting the characters the dialogue and the absolutely ridiculous and insulting holefilled plot do not waste your money on this garbage it will only make you angry not a single note of this film rings true nothing that happens seems even remotely plausible spoilers the pike character frames the man she kills for her kidnapping and the police buy it not really sure why they dont check to see if he had an alibi for the day she disappeared not really sure why they believe that she murdered her kidnapper while being raped and then instead of calling 911 she got in a car covered in blood and drove to another state to be with her husband who  according to her own diary  she believed hated her and wanted to kill her writing this and having to remember this stupid film is making me angry again im gonna stop dont go see this garbage watch body heat instead it is way better
