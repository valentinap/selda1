i do not understand any of the good reviews of this movie i think that its hook is the gimmick of the kids growing up in it but there is nothing redeeming or even entertaining about this movie it was terrible the story bordered on depressing the trailer leads one to believe that this is a documentary of a childs life but it is not there are actors in it it was awful just awful and i do hope it will not end up winning an oscar surely someone could do a coming of age movie better or a documentary set over 12 years better i wish i could understand what the reasoning behind the good reviews i watched the movie and i just cannot see it
