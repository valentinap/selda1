lord of the rings is an overlong piece of crap from one of the biggest hacks in hollywood peter jackson used to make low budget horror films that were amazing now he makes big hollywood movies with big hollywood stars his aim now isnt to make good movies his aim is now to make as much money as he can why cant hollywood start making films that are actually good instead of films that they make to reel in cash who needs so much money why does peter jackson need more money seriously peter jackson needs to stop making movies he ruined king kong recently and he made three films that are entirely too long based on a crappy overlong series get this film off the top 250 of all time it sucks
