as many have said it is the uneventual life of a person much like the truman show which made fun on the reality tv this basically wants to be the truman show obviously this doesnt really work because you see his 12 years in the 3 hours if they made a tv show about the main character it would have most likely never lasted 12 years but then again people watch all kind of reality tv for me it did nothing and i stopped watching after the first 20 or so minutes and just skipped through until the end people called it life great but i rather watch the goldbergs for that at least it is funny and funny enough being a child of the 80s i can relate to it
