this is one of the worst films i have ever seen the actors are good as is the cinematography and the editing but thats that the script is a bunch of completely rubbish lines with no real meaning and special effects that have been done thousands of times and arent interesting enough to keep our attention the score is distracting the villain is the most implausible villain i have ever seen people who do evil things have purposes the joker doesnt have any even if there was a person like that s he wouldnt be able to have minions because that kind of madness isnt a shared one people kill for power or revenge or money which is another type of power basically they have to have a purpose to unite and do evil things all of the bs the joker said about evil and good completely miss the point about good evil and humanity they simply dont make sense and what makes me furious is the fact that a lot of intelligent or at least more or less intelligent people are quoting those lines as if they meant anything they dont and they arent even entertaining
