i had heard quite a bit for mission impossible especially now that the third one is about to come out in the theaters i knew my parents owned the first mission impossible but due to the crazy antics tom cruise has pulled on well basically everyone he has pretty much turned me off of his movies but i figured to give the mission impossible movies a shot while over all this is an exciting actionspy flicks there were only a few scenes in the movie i felt were worth the watch obviously the exciting scene of tom coming through the ceiling on wires and copying the information onto disk the last action sequence of the helicopter and train with ethan and our surprise villain very well thought out unrealistic but exciting to watch over all for movies sake give mission impossible a chance but its nothing i would scream or jump on couches about  410
