worst 3 hours of my life it got to the end and i was still waiting for something to happen i would of had a more productive time watching grass grow dont waste your time watching this film i dont see the point in the film or what it was trying to achieve it went through a boys life that had no real significant moments in it the most outrageous thing he did was smoke a cigarette at 15 it was basically a film of a kids life that would not effect or inspire anybody he was a pessimist with no real goals in life he didnt go through any dramatic transformations or offer anything to the world he didnt achieve much it was a pointless film it was like the film was made to actually be as bad boring and ordinary as possible not one part of the film was embellished or interesting to sum it up an awful film
