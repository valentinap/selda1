pretty much all movies which i ever liked are highly rated on imdb although not all highly rated movies on imdb are movies which i like and this is one of them the movie was shot over many years and this is its main selling point cool thats it nothing else it was a clich_ scene after clich_ scene for almost three hours three hours which ill never get back  id rate it with negative 3 but theres no rating lower than 1 sometimes a movie starts bad it goes on for a while but then at the end something new and unique happens and you think oh i totally did not expect that so it was worth seeing it well not now bad start middle and end oh he met another girl really they like each other? is this how people who like each other act? the acting was so poor and just about every line said was said in so unnatural way real people in real situations simply do not look like or act like that i felt no attachment of any kind to any of the characters none of them seemed to have any social skills none of the characters has done anything worth mentioning in all their lives they had some failed attempts for deep and meaningful conversations the plot for such conversations goes like blah blah life blah blah meaning blah blah now be impressed with how much we said blah blah
