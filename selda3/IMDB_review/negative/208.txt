quite frankly one of the worst movies ive ever sat through forget the length forget the plot forget the acting the story was so far fetched and actually insulted the intelligence of the paying viewers this movie isnt even worthy of a review the acting was terrible across the board with the exception of rosamund pike even neil patrick harris was terrible ben affleck has some talent but ive never seen an actors talent meter swing so radically from one side to the other theres no redeeming value or consistency in anything affleck does those of you that are digging deep and sharing your views of the brilliance of this movie need to have a reality check
