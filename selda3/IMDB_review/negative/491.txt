dont fool yourself its just bad dont watch it you may thank me for this advice i wanted to keep this comment short because i dont want to spend more time of my life for this movie almost three hours was enough on the other side the movie made me feel better about myself in some way i mean some people spent 12 years making this what a waste this was refreshing because they lost more of their life than me this long production time doesnt show itself in the quality i had some feeling that the cinematographers wanted to work against quality they used the style of bad propaganda movies typical suburban shots where you expect that someone jumps out of a bush selling m*th to the children of course it would be explained too why it is bad like everything else in this movie they put the words in your mouth leaving nothing for the imagination i dont even mention that the main character is not special at all even more boring than an average person oh and he makes bad quality photos too in this bad quality movie living the life of an artist in a movie which never heard of art and he leaves his picture in the developer for waaay to long listening to the schematic monologue of his teacher instead you will find all kinds of schemes and clich_s in this piece of modern film history as they call it in this movie which doesnt dare to state anything the whole movie was like a 3 hours long idk showing alcohol like a gateway to becoming whitetrash is promarijuana i guess but only daring to show it for a split of a second i watched every second of this movie just to see how are they going to come out of this pit? with a highly unrealistic chick acting like a dateraper sitting with our high placebomescaline main character in the sunset repeating the concept of this film i dont know
