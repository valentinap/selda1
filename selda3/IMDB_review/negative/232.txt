ok i was fooled by both some of the reviews and the high score and i wasted about 3 hours of my life sitting in the cinema i cant say im a scifi lover but if films like blade runner only get 82 then this one should get 45 i watched gone girl the other day which is so much better than this one both in pacing and plot and that film only get 84how can this one get 9? another thing is the ending is too predictable and too sweet happy ending is good people love things that make them happy but in reality there never has a perfect ending like thatthe ending seems too sweet for me and some people are spoiled by these good endings also dont understand why made the brother a completely fool? he seems has nothing to do with everything? a contrast? to what? and the film never mentioned him after the girl sorry i even dont remember their names find out the secret which doesnt make sense to me anyway im disappointed and i dont want t say more about this film i fell asleep several times due to that horrible pacingi cant believe a film could be sooooo long which almost becomes a torture for me
