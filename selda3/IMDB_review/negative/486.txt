dont waste your time watching this film every interesting idea about the movie is thrown out the window half way through i found fascinating the parallel story thats being told between the main character and his daughter at some point nolan no longer cares for this so he decides to use time however he pleases the film is a huge contradiction and the way it is solved is just confusing and pretending to be more complex than it actually is they are on a mission thats more important than any personal issue man kinds future depends solely on the success of it but fè©k that in this kind of hollywood bullshit protagonists cant die just because test audiences dont like that it makes them really really sad so against all odds mcconaughey makes it back home hooray for him and for all the idiots who need this kind of ending mark my words by the time matt damon appears you will be compelled to kick christopher nolan right in the balls i read that they were advised by physicist in order to be scientifically accurate im sure every accurate idea came from other films like 2001 event horizon etc interstellar is a cash grab if you spent your money on this be sure to check on your butt hole christopher nolan might have already had his way with you my asshole is intact because i torrented this bad boy suck on that film industry
