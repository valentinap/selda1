childish presentation boring in parts very silly overall noisy irritating soundtrack unnecessarily long scenes strange direction techniques very few real thrills a lot of hype  and i never realized what an enormous nose tom cruise has maybe thats why one of the female leads also has a giant schnozzle the film was a gross disappointment though i guess diehard cruise fans will eat it up any comparison between this effort and the tv series is virtually pointless as the tv shows were fast exciting clever superblydirected full of suspense with a lot of sharp dialogue and actors who were true craftsmen sorry but this flick is a real bummer
