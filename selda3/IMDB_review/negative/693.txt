i dont wish to offend any one but to protect the integrity of the rating system honestly if you enjoyed the film it was more because you read the books and have been avid about the story for a few decades than it was its cinematic quality im sure it was wonderful for what it was but people was it really the second best movie ever released saying that the return of the king was of better quality than network dr strange love or any of the greats is naive its story is not its so if you voted so highly for its story than you were voting for the book visually impressive but think about the pictures budget so what was it than it was unoriginal and certainly not worthy of second best film on imdb
