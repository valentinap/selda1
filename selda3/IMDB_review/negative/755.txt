 perhaps i cant lay all the blame on peter jackson the story was dumb to begin with for those that dont know the idea of the ring originates from platos the republic the ring of gyges basically this ring gives gyges the power of invisibility which he exploits to take over some kingdom and yada yada not a very interesting story on its own but good within the context of the republic glaucon and plato were arguing over the tendency of man to do good over evil and vice versa lotr does not intertwine philosophical explorations with a clever plot instead it merely takes this stupid ring story out of its origin and assumes that is insightful blah this is why i rarely akin to fantasy its authors are prone to employing cheap fiction thanks for making america even dumber peter jackson never make another movie please
