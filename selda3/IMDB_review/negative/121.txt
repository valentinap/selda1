there have been too many versions of the movie cinderella and this modern version was so disappointing indeed it is made for kids only and not for adults the movie was so boring walt disney pictures did not offer anything new in this dull and outdated sequel the remake was much worse than copy and pastea lot of imitation of cinderella movies and nothing original walt disney stole all the ideas and movie plot from orlando corradi see orlando corradis cinderella movie and see the shocking evidence how disney is clever in rip off & theft the acting is so tasteless see the original version and avoid this imitated version
