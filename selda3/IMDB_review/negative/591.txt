i have just finished watching fight club simply put it is the most profoundly depraved and deeply disturbing film i can ever remember seeing if our culture was not crumbling at a full gallop we would see this vile and wicked film for what it is could such a film have been made even twenty years ago will anyone care or even take notice of such a film twenty years from now we are lost
