transcendence had so much potential johnny depp morgan freeman big budget scifi thriller commenting on the evolutionary struggle between man and machine what could possibly go wrong? everything apparently there is no way that a scientist paul bettany whos been off the grid in a cave somewhere for two years could write a virus that would outsmart a selfaware supercomputer johnny depp so advanced over the same time period that it can literally build a human copy of itself from the sands of the earth no way even if the original source code was written by said cave scientist the movie establishes that the supercomputer has been rewriting its code ever since it became selfaware pauls character wasnt even as smart as the human johnny depp and were expected to believe that paul can outsmart johnny as a supercomputer with unlimited resources? sigh and to the subject of national defense a lone fbi agent whos not even a high ranking official makes the decision to side with a known terrorist group to shut down all networks and electricity on the planet? seriously? the united states government or any other world government would sooner take out the terrorist cell and the fbi agent and negotiate with the supercomputer before allowing all hospitals communication commerce defense and refrigeration to shut down in a moments notice and even if we take the premise that the supercomputer committed suicide to save the life of the scientist who wrote the virus why would he do that? he could have easily saved the scientist his wife rebecca halland everyone else by just taking the gun from the terrorist holding the scientist hostage he can sprout nanotechnology from the ground which is how he took everybody elses gun double sigh i was very disappointed again because this movie had so much potential instead of being awesome its just another classic example of poor script writing and relying on big names and special effects to do the job whats worse the makers of this film should have known better shame normally id give this movie a 410 however for its audacity to advertise brilliance and be anything but it gets a 1
