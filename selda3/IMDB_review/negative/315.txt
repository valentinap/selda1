in this movie theres cgi in every shot even cinderellas shoes are but cgi hard to believe yet true i can barely watch so much visual boredom lacking real props in the acting i cant see fairy tale type of acting too i would have expected to see the acting being at least as intensive as in the wizard of oz or cinderfella the actors mimics are close to nothing i dont comprehend on why press reports are reporting cate blanchetts performance as overacting gee if anything else than a botoxed face is already declared as overacting these guys should definitively stop gazing at mannequins im a huge fan of kenneth branagh from his shakespeare movies but this time he set the bar too low
