if no one has any objections to the church scene i wonder how they would have reacted when it would rather be a mosque or the greenpeace headquarters this movie shows the exact same thing valentines device did how it could use good music to make you laugh at the most horrible things and think literally it is ok in a way this movie places valentines device right in the theater and shows us our true reactions to horror dished up in the right atmosphere totally acceptable i wonder how we would react because we are aware of the moral wrongness if this music was played and well choreographed in a nazi concentration camp congratulations if you liked the church scene and the scene where the world leaders lost their heads you just experienced the numbing effect the nazi soldiers have felt as they led people to be incinerated full of the music of the f™hrer
