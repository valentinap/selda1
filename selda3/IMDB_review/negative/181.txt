spoilers are added in my short review  well  its hard to describe what i watched about an hour ago  ive read the books  of course they are not something special or brilliant but they can perfectly take place in the list of enjoyable ones  i was shocked how much the director has changed the plot of the books and the way that the main characters should be presented in this movie  one word dissapointment   somehow i lost the connection with the whole atmosphere in the middle of the movie  it felt like it is a different story that was missing something  dont know why but the performance of shailene didnt work for me this time  her pretty face just ruined everything that i imagined as a strong and tough character in insurgent   a lot of the key moments in the book were gone and for the readers especially it was not that much of a satisfaction   the second part of the movie was a total disaster  i cant believe how the writer agreed for such a dramatic change in the plot  while sitting and watching the movie i was so inpatient to see the final battle  the emotional conclusion  the way jeanine should have died but the thrill suddenly disappeared after a few scenes   what was that with the box ? some kind of joke or what ? i cant imagine what is gonna be the next movie allegiant and im not sure if im gonna watch it but probably it will be something far away from the real story  the only pros of insurgent were the great cinematography and visual effects supported with not that bad soundtrack
