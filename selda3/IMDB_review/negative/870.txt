the movie was good but to have it rated as the top 10 movies of all time is absurd if you are a child or you like movies that you just sit and watch like a zombie this is your top 10 movie come on a superhero move being in the top 10 are you kidding me i cant believe people are putting it in the same league the god father ss redemption lotr the list goes on and on i have to say the graphics are some of the best i have seen the actors played their parts great i just thought there was not much story line if you like movies with substance i would wait until it comes to a movie channel or video
