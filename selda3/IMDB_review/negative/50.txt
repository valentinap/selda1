throughout the whole freaking movie i was like damn what a nice movie right there and then it ended in such a way that i want to punch every single retard that had anything to do with the story ending no that is not an inception ending where it brilliantly makes you doubt about the outcome this ending was just plain stupid it was as if at the end of it the writer whispered in my ears ok you paid for it you liked it you waisted your freaking time now get the hell out of this theater as if they lost the budget to fund this movie and they wanted to end working on this movie the sooner possible oh and by the way dear writer for your info why do not play scrabble when we eat octopus whatever what could easily be a massive movie got 100% ruined in just a 5 minutes ending i mean he didnt even sleep with her and u claim this is his child ffs im so mad right now damn you
