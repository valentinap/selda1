when i want to watch a movie i want to watch something exciting something attracting and at least not a waste of time this movie was obviously way too boring firstly it was way ahead then its times even ahead then star trek and its voyages coming to reality jhonny d is one brilliant actor when ever his movies are out he character and role is not only challenging but different this time it was ridiculous i dont know but i believe he would worked only for a matter a few minutes while working for the entire movie rest of the cast is brilliant but perhaps they are also deceive by the script i agree script is new completely futuristic and fascinating but the way they are adapted it and put it up on the screen was too boring there are scenes of action some really freaky stuff too but its not exciting its not attracting you to watch it again and again its too predictable you can not only guess the next scene but even the dialogues in short its a horrible movie to watch i was 110% bored while watching it but then again if you are a johnny d fan and nothing else to do in life then watch it
