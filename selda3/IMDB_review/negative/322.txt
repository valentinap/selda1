im a huge fan of the original mission impossible television series on which this was based when it was announced that a movie version would be made i naively got very excited with anticipation of seeing it i read every scrap of information published about the movie before its release however when i saw it i was very disappointed this wasnt mission impossible at all but a tom cruise action vehicle i never bothered to see any of sequels its too bad that a whole generation of movie goers will think that this is mission impossible without ever having seen the brilliant television series it doesnt surprise me that greg morris walked out in the middle of this film and said its an abomination because tom cruise has tainted mis image so badly no one will ever make a television show or motion picture that faithfully captures the essence of mi at least not during mr cruises lifetime or mine thanks a lot tom
