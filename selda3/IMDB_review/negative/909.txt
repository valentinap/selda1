wellfirst of all the whole story and plot got nothing to do with the original comic book story which already makes it even more unauthentic and unwatchable then it already is the joker basically had some help killing the mobsters of gotham city along with other freaks batmans foes like him like two face poison ivy etc second the movie changed the whole atmosphere and story into a shallow script with too much special effects and cgi not mentioning big stunts and the same predictable and uninspired below mediocre kind of plot common to most action movies and comic based movies these days and besides the acting and direction were just bad and some characters seemed not convincing and stupid not mentioning the way the writers changed some important key characters like the joker heath ledger was just weirdhe didnt fit to the jokers role in conclusion a complete waste of time including your brain cells an endless and unwatchable crapfest an overrated and over hyped lame knight who is not a gentleman nor a good movie or a good comic book adaption
