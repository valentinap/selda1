just hate nolan or nolanlovers should i say constant bombardment of science humbug correspondence to theory is not the point contrast it with the silence of 2001 contrast it with the film it tries to imitate now an average scifi story is elevated into the rank of greatest films without even a solid cinematic base except those visuals and effects that become a standard technical expertise you sciencegeniuses all needed this information overload to accept a noteven average story as a cinematic masterpiece how i hope the days come when this movie shall share its honorable place in the dustbin of history alongside battlefield earth or armageddon etc when the nolan fanboys and its industrial franchise fade away
