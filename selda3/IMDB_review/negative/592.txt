i have read many reviews for this movie and most of them used words like unique excellent and life changing i have just one question how the acting by both the leads was good i got to admit that but havent people heard of something called a script the movie was just a collection of pathetic scenes each one leaving you more confused and bored then u were before well for direction there wasnt any all in all i have to say i have seen my share of bad movie this one is a strong contender for the top spot its a shame talent like brad pitt considered doing such a mindless senseless scriptless and tasteless movie which even the brilliant acting by the male leads couldnt save the one point is purely for the acting
