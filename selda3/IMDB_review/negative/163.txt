the good cinematography and acting this is a beautiful film and the starstudded cast did as well as could be expected under the circumstances the bad the script this film should be an edgeoftheseat thriller and an exploration of what is possible in the future instead it was as flat as a busted balloon there was no tension there was stuff exploding but we didnt care aside from the lack of suspense a contributing factor to the flaccid plot was the premise scifi films require a simple explanation for the breakthrough being depicted in back to the future we are taken all over the spacetime continuum we get the rules and we go along for the ride the concept of cyberhuman evolution is ahead of the story we do not get the parameters of the concept are these new beings cyberpeople? what are those flying dots? are they pieces of people or matter? there isnt a cohesive story about the scientific breakthrough we do not know when the characters are in jeopardy or what will happen when the thing gets them we dont know what the thing is even death does not have absolute boundaries in this film but there is no explanation for how johnny depp finds a way back at some point we give up trying to put together an explanation for the author and we dont believe it there ends the magic of film we cannot suspend disbelief any longer
