even though it suppose to be based on the 1966 tv series anyone who has followed or really liked the television show will be disappointed because it doesnt have 4 guys but 1 as though the creators of this movie version has decided to interwine james bond solo idea into it so all you see throughout the movie is tom cruise being in the highlighted so much that you get the impression that maybe they should of made top gun 1996 movie instead i dont like when movie creators dont honor and adhere to original tv or movie concepts as it seems spitefully disrespectful as if they are saying i have a better idea i wont see anymore mission impossible movies as a result of this its like the green hornet 2011 movie that ruins a good concept by hijacking it totally somewhere else
