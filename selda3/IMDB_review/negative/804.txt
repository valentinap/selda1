 i never write reviews for movies good or bad but seeing this movie in the top 250 list makes me mad its just a movie for teenagers who dont question why things happen when they just dont make sense i went to see this movie with great expectations because my brother told me it was great but after the first five minutes i knew what kind of movie i as was about to suffer one clich‹© after the other with no characters development nothing gothic anywhere and nothing dark or mysterious about this talking batman either also i dont see anything great about the joker interpretation for me leger was just ok no need to glorify an actor because of his death the other actors were just as terrible as the script allowed them to be i really dont remember one minute of believable conversation between any of the characters for a movie to be great it needs at least to make sense its not that you cannot have explosions or great action but this film reminds me more of a bugs bunny cartoon where bugs can be anywhere when he wants to and pull anything out his sleeve i dont want to mention anything specific to avoid spoilers but just expect a ton of non sense action from a bunch of bugs bunny characters its sad how 100000 people cannot see beyond the special effects and tell themselves that doesnt make sense he was in that other ten places 5 minutes ago
