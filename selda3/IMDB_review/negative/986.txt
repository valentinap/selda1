i love batman in fact i loved batman begins as much as i did the 1989 micheal keaton one but this one i believe has sold out it was obvious theyre trying to tap into the saw audience by making the joker some kind of ultra realistic disgusting serial killer nicholsons performance was so superior its not even funny the heath ledger joker had no class whatsoever and was a completely unbelievable bullshit philosopher through out why did he have a knife where was the long ass gun jokers always supposed to have very saw like games that he played on the masses were a disappointment the problem is also that the movie tries desperately to tie in ultra gritty realism and philosophical justifications its a comic book for gods sake don t try so hard to make it realistic it was created with a lot of skill but just took the wrong turn from what i was hoping for all the situations where just contrived reincarnations of other scenes weve seen in other recent blockbusters the hostage scenes 16 blocks inside man other stupid cop movies the played out you have to chose the girl or some other chump just like in the spider man movie bat man begins was steady and a very creative new take on the comic they should of focused the originality instead of making an overly dramatic pile of feces and two face one of my favorite villains seemed like they just pulled that one out of their ass and made him into a totally unpredictable dick that got added on towards the end of the movie and then killed off without ever doing anything remotely cool the cell phone sonar thing was inane so much potential wasted
