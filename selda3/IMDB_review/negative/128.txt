the universe is full of fascinating facts its mindbending to contemplate for example the awesome size of our galaxy light travels 186000 miles per second and yet it takes 100000 years for a single beam of light to cross the entire milky way galaxy and our galaxy to quote carl sagan is only one among billions and billions the vastness of space truly is stunning but thanks to a worm hole the folks in interstellar leave the milky way in a cosmic snap of the fingers and yet having just achieved this most amazing of all feats our heroes are pretty much bored to tears instead everybody is more concerned with some fatherdaughter relationship that wasnt developed in the first place look if youre going to make a movie that purports to explore the fascinating mysteries of the universe then do it have some wonderment in the story dazzle me not only with visuals but with amazement at the astonishing scope of our universe and why not produce a script that obeys the laws of astrophysics or at least some theories thereof? this movie takes something that would dwarf the apollo lunar missions and turns it into some ridiculous plan aplan b tediousness i suggest instead watching through the wormhole with morgan freeman or re watching 2001 a space odyssey heck even contact with jodie foster is far more entertaining and imaginative than interstellar and yet  92 stars im not saying 10star reviews on this site are phony after all major film critics also are raving about interstellar unfortunately i find most professional film critics about as credible as the physics in this movie frankly interstellar is a boring movie and if that puts me in the vast minority of reviewers fine i can live with that because i have minimum standards when i pay $11 for admission and $850 for large popcorn stay home and read a good book instead or just gaze out at the night sky and reflect on our amazing universe
