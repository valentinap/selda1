make fun of me all you want but boyhood is the worst film ive ever seen and ive seen gigli and birdemic the concept of the film far exceeded its actual execution it was just a tortuous experience for me i sat there forcing myself to finish it forcing myself to forgive its shortcomings praying for something profound to hit me i think the film really shows linklaters failure to connect with the generation he attempts to portray hell use a pop song or a shot of an ipod or some other cheap reference to suggest a specific moment in time but his perspective is that of an ignorant adult oversimplifying or completely misinterpreting the internal experience of childhood maybe thats why so many critics identify with the film because they like many adults suffer from the same disillusionment when failing to understand young people today and why are there so many onedimensional characters in this film? this is inexcusable the lead actor the sister the mother the two alcoholic step fathers the girlfriends the most interesting character is by far the dad played by ethan hawke who is actually a complex human being like the rest of us who grows always trying to guide his son and impart wisdom where he can even when unqualified everyone else is a shadow of a borderline offensive clich_ why arent more critics mentioning this? the lead was clearly cast because he was a goodlooking kid there obviously isnt a single acting bone in his body he doesnt even seem interested in anything there is a dull lifelessness in his performance i cant help but think linklater views teenagers as dull lifeless emotionless creatures i give the filmmakers credit for experimenting with their creativity and committing to the process but is this really the best picture frontrunner? really??? with this script? these performances? seriously?
