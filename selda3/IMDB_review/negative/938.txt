 you have got to be kidding me my husband and i decided to watch this piece of garbage on new years eve instead of a marathon of the office boy did we make the wrong choice how do people like this film what has happened to artistic integrity and plain old good taste the plot was disjointed confusing and ridiculous the direction was horrid even the actors who many i respect all looked like a bunch of sell outs who were in it for the paycheck gary oldman are you joking one of the greatest actors what a horrible role could you not keep your english accent out of gotham when you raised your voice dont you learn how to do that in acting 101 the highlight of the movie is when rachel blows up sorry to be morbid but talk about a bore that maggie girl should take some lessons from her at least competent brother can anyone explain the plot in 1000 words or less unbelievably all over the place heath ledger did a good job as the joker but please dont tell me this role drove him to emotional torment and insomnia i have great respect for him as an actor and feel so sad for his death i just dont understand what was so dark about the dark knight batman should definitely hang up his suit
