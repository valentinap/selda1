reading the other reviews here its hard to conceive that i watched the same movie everyone is gushing about the central premise is hardly noble although perhaps quite the likely selfish outcome ie after trashing this planet lets go trash some others the black hole visualizations were quite lame this is not a great scifi film even remotely in the league of 2001 although a cursory superficial viewing might suggest so to an unthinking nonscifi buff a great scifi film would naturally start by 1st adapting a great scifi story these are yet to be made such as ringworld dyson spheres and fleet of worlds concepts to think that all these mind boggling stories exist yet this rather old and tired story concept is chosen to lavish money on is strange although it is somewhat understandable as the aforementioned stories would be much greater challenges all around and so its best that they are ignored rather than poorly realized as this primarily propaganda piece
