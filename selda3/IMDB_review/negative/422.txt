i found this film very disturbing and it was a waste of my time going to see the film i found that it took awhile to understand the story and there wasnt much of an introduction of the characters throughout the entire film i thought that johnny depp was better in the pirate of the caribbeans franchise overall the film was ok in some parts of the film can the makers of the film please make a better version of the movie and call it a different name and maybe if they put more work into it and had better scripts i would be more satisfied with the film i recommend this film to people who hate science fiction as it really brings out the weaknesses and errors that occurs in science
