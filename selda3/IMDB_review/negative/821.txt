 disclaimer may contain spoilers sorry people despite all the unbelievable hoopla this movie is terrible the acting is wooden the story line is moronic the endless one dimensional tirades about heroes and anti heroes are totally childish and idiotic the much praised ledger in the role of joker is laughable there is nothing in his act that is worth mentioning as a matter of fact he was overacting big time and it made it painful to watch his presence on the screen the hand to hand fighting scenes were retarded slow as molasses compare the martial art in this movie to the martial art in the bourne trilogy night and day even batman and robin is more enjoyable to watch than this sorry excuse for an action film two thumbs down way way down
