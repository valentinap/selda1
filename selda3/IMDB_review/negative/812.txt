i was very disappointed in this film as so many people recommended this film as the greatest one ever created it was no1 in the imdb chart so i rushed out and bought it only to find out that i have wasted ä£12 on this very below average gangster film which went on for a full 3 hours if you want a decent gangster flick i would recommend either goodfellas or casino as the best in the genre
