i will usually watch any film with johnny depp in it but i wish that i had made this the exception to my rule somehow as soon as this film began i knew i was in trouble call it an intuitive sense based on the number of films ive watched or whatever but the truth is i was correct it is a tremendous waste of exceptional talent in a film that is way beyond preposterous i can deal with expanding what is believable but this film presents it in a way that is incredibly not interesting i found myself not caring within 30 minutes actually to make a scifi film so lacking takes a certain kind of talent its a shame because the genre is screaming for intelligent wellmade movies its also a cruel joke to fill it with so much top talent and then waste it with so poor a script johnny depp could not look more bored and one of his over the top performances might have helped here
