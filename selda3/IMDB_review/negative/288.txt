ive finally come to see this terrible movie and im still not done shaking my head in disappointment classic tale of pure good and pure evil plus saving the world plus wolf turned into sheep i mean into a beautiful woman burglar with whom the main hero evidently falls in love plus redemption through selfsacrifice plus obliterating all bad guys with a casual ease plus and all these pluses add up to a terribly big minus this is a spy flick even worse and lamer than james bond it is as far from being realistic as it gets virtually nothing that tomcruise does smells like reality watch it if you think that magnificent stunts and burning kerosene and pleasing your twisted need for grandeur are what a good movie is made of the two good things about the movie are the stunts bravely done but absolutely unrealistic for the setting and the soundtrack that is quite decent for these two i give this movie a weak 3 it wasnt worth the time
