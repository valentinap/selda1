this show is almost indescribably bad it makes me angry just to think about caveat i dont know a whole lot about green arrow his name is oliver queen he gained his skills while marooned on an island hes rich and he is so easy to make fun of but this isnt an attack on the concept ive seen sillier concepts work out to be much better shows arrow is one of those shows where wooden acting poor directing and writing about on par with the twilight saga come together to create one of the most offensive television experiences i have ever had and ive seen jersey shore stephen amell as the titular hero green arrow and katie cassidy as laurel are particularly bad with approximately oneandahalf facial expressions between them and a penchant for removing themselves from the room as the standard method of showing anger you could make a drinking game out of it truly the writing is staggeringly awful however when i say writing im not speaking about the plot that might yet unravel over time but its too early to tell what i mean is the actual words which come out of peoples mouths there is a specific scene which comes to mind where oliver and his best friend tommy are seated at a table discussing their friendship tommy reveals that hes been sleeping with laurel and olivers only reaction is thats okay i forgive you i closed my eyes for this scene and realized that i could not even tell who was saying what at certain points they have no verbal mannerisms and the funny best friend has no real sense of humor that i could discern plus his jokes plain suck but i guess thats a minor point all things considered i should point out that recently a friend told me that tommy merlyn turns into green arrows nemesis which means they of course have a lot in common and might seem like the same person at times but that doesnt really come across as purposeful on this show the directing is maybe the worst offender here because a good director could turn cruddy actors and poor writing into something downright entertaining just look at sam raimis work on spiderman 1 and 2 instead i find myself imagining david barrett or john dahl or any number of the other directors on this show sitting there texting while scenes are happening maybe eating a sandwich or something not paying attention must be hungry work im getting into a lot of detail so im just going to cut this off and say that i should have seen it coming just look at the promo picture really consider it that was the very first thing we were shown regarding this series ask yourself what that says about their priorities
