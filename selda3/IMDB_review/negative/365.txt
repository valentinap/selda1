i vote 110because its awful to compare other marvel movies hulk is good  iron man 123 are great captain america 12 and avengers are awesome thor 12 and this are bad at logic unreasonable for adult if this movie is for 012 kidsand not marvel presents i will not say anything and wont recommend any friends to see it in my impression_marvel is a very good movie maker and always surprised me but this and thor 12there are very serious logical problems to make you feel vulgar there are tons of good movie on imdb top listfor kids if you think this is marvel presents watch this just waste your time and money i am very doubt it how to get 80+ point on imdb
