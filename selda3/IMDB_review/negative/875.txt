christopher nolan is a great director he several great movies under his belt such as memento the prestige and batman begins i loved these and so when thats why i went to see the dark knight i expected something great i heard people praising it as a masterpiece or best movie in 10 years so i saw it major disappointment i walked out of the theatre befuddled so thats what the hype was all about although ledger completely owns the role of the joker and he gives a fantastic performance that must be seen the movie surrounding it is at times mediocre the pacing character arcs direction and impact of the movie are all flawed the ending was pretty terrible too its not a bad movie and id give it a 7 10 but i must vote a 1 because of all the fanboys that are blinded by the hype
