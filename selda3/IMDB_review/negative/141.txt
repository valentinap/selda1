the one is because the high score the movie is not that terrible and some entertainment value maybe a 410 is more appropriate i found ben affleck acting was quite bad i didnt care much about any of the characters but maybe the lead investigator but not much time is actually spent on the police work anyway the plot is just to impossibleincredible and the twists are just too convenient and stupid ultimately you dont really care about what is happening because the husband character is flat and ben seems completely disconnected with the events that happen to him he seems to not give 2 s**** why would he have married this psycho without noticing anything? i dont know and i dont care
