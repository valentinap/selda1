what can i say about this film the hype was there very topical a director with an amazing eye all start cast the film should have been very good all round but sadly it is far from it the plot is weak acting poor and the dumbing down of the science has actually led to a film which makes little or no sense who is the audience suppose to connect with? maybe the annoying wife the dead scientist in a computer the annoying friend or the terrible cast of sub characters who all have no substance or any kind of interesting back story if your doing science fiction based around such an interesting and real concept please show some respect to the intelligence of your target audience utter rubbish
