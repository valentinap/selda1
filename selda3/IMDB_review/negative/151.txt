the movie starts lengthy with building the plot base everyone knows from the trailer or movie description after five minutes i already feel out of breath but try hard to sit through the boring conversations and the obvious i need lots of chips and popcorn to endure this phase after the long wait in the middle of the movie i am rewarded with excellent cgi effects and technological advances that would make everybody saliva and handle over their money immediately in real life its easy to fall in love with this digital creature who comes up with such great ideas i was thinking open api would be l33t if will casters mission was to transcend i was waiting for him to commit to github i was waiting for great things in this movie but the movie clearly was not made for the educated masses but for a stubborn religious audience who likes all movies to be the same the plot turned sour but not unexpectedly the religious fanatics who want to play god and control everything on this planet team up to destroy the new intelligence with mortars they repeatedly attack the data center trying to destroy the new hope for the planet of course the few religious lunatics win by the most crazy means ever with a virus its beyond me how a supercluster ai intelligence does not have security all emotional attachment aside there should be security running as basic protocols in the background after all he was connected to the internet a dangerous place was the data center running on windows xp first edition ?? in the beginning of the movie the first thing will caster did after going digital was to rewrite his code base this is what everybody would have done  optimize code all the time after all its his natural state to be digital and to innovate therefore the virus was impossible to implement the code to compromise by max waters did not even exist anymore  we learned that after 20 minutes in how would will  as an intelligent being  not create his own programming language and complete code rewrite? how??? all in all a very disappointing piece of cgi bliss it makes me upset about the religious screenwriter who once again gives us the american nightmare its possible to kill all innovation with weapons and religious people will always rule and control
