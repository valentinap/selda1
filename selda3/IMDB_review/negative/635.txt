this has got to be one of the most overrated movies of alltime oooh it was all in his mind how original no one has ever thought of that before obviously i am being sarcastic this movie was so boring that i could only get about halfway through it before having to stop and only later did i get around to watching the second half that was a mistake it was as utterly pointless and uninteresting in the second half as it was in the first this is a classic example of a movie being popular simply because it was trendy for people to say that they liked it and brad pitt give me a break the guy is a hack only a star because of his looks he simply cant act
