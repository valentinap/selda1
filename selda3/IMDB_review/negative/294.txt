its a shame that people are rating this movie so high i registered just to put some sense into imdb i actually dont believe in the ratings of this site anymore possible explanation for a high rating is that people are paid to rate the movie or most people think they are geniuses if they tell their friends that they love a scifi mindblowing movie even though that movie actually doesnt make sense i love nolan but he dropped the ball on this one this has potential but he created a mess out of it a lot of scientific inconsistencies useless characters messy plots one of the most overrated films ever lets bring back some credibility in this site
