did i see the same movie that many other people gave a ten vote?? probably not the movie doesnt give any logic explanation to anything everything in the movie is treated in the most superficial possible way to not get completely disappointed all through the movie you would need to switch off your brain completely otherwise you wont get any answers to the questions that necessarily come to your mind also great actors like matthew mcconaughey are acting awfully probably realizing they are acting in a dumb movie all the director is trying to do is excite the audience with the soundtrack and special effects probably realizing himself how poor the plot is how could so many good actors accept to work in such a poor movie? and how come so many critics are writing that this is a great movie? i would really like to know what great directors like scorsese di palma herzog spielberg would think about this movie in two words absolutely disappointing
