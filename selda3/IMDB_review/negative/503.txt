cinderella is the worst movie and a clich_ remake by walt disney studios are walt disney so desperate to rip off and copy all cinderella movie scenes and to make a very bad copy i saw the previous cinderella movies especially the original cinderella movie they were too much better and well done than this stolen and pirated copy movie why would the producers of walt disney studios make a very boring film which even kids might hate because of the absence of creativity to be honest and to tell the truth i regret seeing this film because it is only made for babies to fool them avoid this movie and watch the original first copy because it is superiorwhile this pirated and rip off movie is so inferior if not the worst movie ever made
