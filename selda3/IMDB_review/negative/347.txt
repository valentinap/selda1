i went out of the movie theater with mixed feelings i love scifi i would have like to travel to other planets not anymore i wanted to like the movie so much that my brain forgot most of the bad side of it first i said to people that interstellar was only for scifi freaks that it was not a feel good movie pretty damn dark and depressing but it was overall a good movie but my love of scifi had block all judgment after talking to other people who saw it my view of the film change radically here are why  1 have you seen stupidest robots than in interstellar 2 the pilot farmer daughter saw gps coordinates in dust yeah right and they goes to those coordinates and find nasa bunker they are abducted by the nasa and the nasa chiefs tells the farmer  you are the one we were waiting to pilot the spaceship that will save humanity even tough the nasa didnt sent the dusty coordinates wtf 3 the extra beinggodor human of the future had placed for humans a wormhole near saturn why so far? 4 they went to a sea planet to rescuesee those sent before that is a sea planet with no ground to plant foodanimals not a good choice and they couldnt see the giant waves from space? 5 they went to a ice planet to rescuesee those sent beforeice planet without animalsplantswhats the point so close to a black hole that a few hours on the planet = 23 years to the spaceship in orbit is that a good choice to try to establish a colony on a ice planet near a black hole? 6 the spaceship is relatively small we could see the 2 shuttles and the ring that create the gravity inside the ship there is the machine to create babies 10010000 ? fertilized human eggswithout ? the incubators if you find a planet yes to the babies but the spaceship so small that the foodbaby milk would be out quite soon 7 have you seen so bad cryogenic bed? a kind of trash bag that wrap you up 8 nobodys really knows whats inside a black hole but nolans view is ridiculous add that the the farmer go out of it and survive to find is old wrecked house inside a giant spaceship
