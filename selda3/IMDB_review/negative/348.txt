i went into this movie with decent hopes given the high rating it had but its not like i was over expecting or anything in the end i found this thing a total a mess i think for me it tried to ride too many lines and as a result failed in most aspects it tried to take itself serious as a spy movie yet it also tried to be this weird comedy and while i think movies are capable of doing both this one just didnt do it well or right to the point where it just bounced me out of the movie completely far as it taking itself seriously i found it to be way over the top unbelievable and unrealistic to the point of being stupid far as the comedy i just didnt think the nuclear head explosions or the mcdonalds being served on a silver platter was funny at all granted im american and i get that english humor is a bit different but i love monty python snatch mr bean even most of the bond films yet most of the funny moments in this movie i just found remarkably unfunny to the point where rather than it being a quick laugh it just completely bounced me out of the movie and the few comical moments that were actually funny were already covered in the trailers so for me this movie totally fell flat on the comedy scale to the point of actually hurting the movie now on the taking itself seriously aspect the whole spy gig the young recruit it just failed on that level for me as well certain aspects of the action scenes were done well and some of the bullet time action was good but i thought the editing needed a lot of work the massacre in the church i just thought was way over done and too long i find it amazing in movies like this how fight scenes go on for many minutes and when its all done people are barely winded breathing normally give me a break go watch professional boxers or mma fighters and see how they look after just one round and they are real athletes who train vigorously so while some of the action was okay it was so over the top that again it bounced me out of the movie so between the bad comedy and overcooked action i was constantly being reminded that i was watching a movie rather than be swept up into one my last beef is with the main kid and the whole recruitment  training camp probably what bounced me out of the movie the most was here we have some reckless rebellious kid whos training to this point has been gymnastics so okay hes flexible has good balance etc yet with little to no further training at all hes the biggest bad ass? the recruitment  initiation program was a joke it wasnt a training program of any kind it was basically lets throw these kids in a no win situation and see how the fend and who comes out on top i get the idea was they were trying to weed through all the recruits to get the best one but the whole while i kept thinking so this kid is just a natural born bad ass because he did gymnastics and has daddy issues? then once hes out and starts real life spy work hes untouchable and better than all the worlds master assassins its like her moms bf who bullies him early in the movie who he confronts in the end and im thinking so other than being this super spy what has he done to actually improve his skills as a fighter? overall i thought the action was decent but very over the edge of what youd consider to be believable movie believability i mean the black comedy was pretty flat and did very little in making me laugh or enjoy myself finally the believability of this kid taking over for his dad and his quasi predecessor was just absurd i give it a 3  10 one point on principle and because i liked the main spy girl a 2nd point because some of the action was decent and a 3rd point for the best part of the movie which was the bare ass scene at the end which shocked me enough to yell out hello
