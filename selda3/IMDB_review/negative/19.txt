what can i say about this movie that would be positive in some way or form? not much really except for a good performance by rebecca hall as the wife of lead johnny depp i really do not see many redeeming qualities to this film it completely fails at even holding my attention for its full length i will spare you the story since frankly i really do not have the strength or desire to reiterate it to anyone just after having watched the film in its entirety transcendence will leave you with a sensation of pointlessness incomprehension and a complete lack of sympathy for its creators if you are a fan of johnny depp and you think he is so dreamy but dont care much about his acting abilities then this movie is for you on the other hand if you are looking for a good movie with a sound plot and solid character development then steer clear of this disaster of a movie called transcendence you would be happy you did
