boyhood this is richard linklaters much talked about film that was actually shot over the course of twelve years chronicling the growth of his characters now let me get something straight before i proceed my reviews are always based upon the finished product what is presented on screen i dont concern myself with what happened behind the scenes what got left on the cutting room floor or how the film was made i concern myself with the balance of style substance and execution now with that in mind let i remind you that this is a work of fiction written by linklater himself not a documentary chronicling the growth of actual people but rather the growth of the characters he wrote had this been a documentary i might have allowed myself to be blindsided just a bit in which manner the film was made but its not a documentary so i will completely disregard the manner in which the film was made that sort of thing does not play a part in my review so what do we have left? honestly not that much two hours and forty five minutes of filler lightly sprinkled with brief moments of conflict with no resolution therefore no character growth i mean this is a film about boyhood or at least one can assume that much given the films title but i will go on a little further to say this is a film chronicling a boys ascension into manhood a lot can happen during that time in fact a lot does happen during that period in ones life which all goes into the molding of the person who you will eventually be unfortunately it seems that were just outsiders looking in youd think that a film about one of the most tumultuous times in ones life would be a roller coaster ride of emotions but what we have is a film thats nearly three hours long devoid of any emotions no life lessons learned by the main characters no emotional growth period what the hell did i just watch? if the characters didnt learn anything then they didnt grow emotionally if they didnt grow emotionally then i have a hard time connecting to the characters on an emotional level sure we can all relate to adolescence but dont let that fool you into thinking that you know these particular characters know why they are the way they are know what drives and motivates their actions and behavior by the end of the film ive watched these human beings grow up physically rather than to grow into beings of consciousness and emotions that make them human
