i love marvel whether it be xmen thor the avengers spiderman iron man most of the commonly known ones of course but i always loved them but to put this as simply as i can though that doesnt mean this will be short this film was filled with 1000 of the most common clichs extracted from these great films and stories and crammed them into one mashedup jumpy unreserved ridiculous abnormal spiteful detestable idiotic moronic absurd ludicrous senseless meaningless pointless terriblywritten unbelievably unrealistic supersupersuperherowannabe movie that very desperately and obviously and obnoxiously attempts to specialeffect everything and i mean everything to simply gain some big bucks because hey its marvel what could go wrong? its sad to see how successful their attempts were i fell for it for me its all due to the avengers because that was freaking amazing even though it had a lot of commonplace stuff and boy do i regret wasting my two hours on this extremely disappointing collage basically its a film made of collages because everything just had to be colorful in outer space no seriously of course everything is colorful there its not like the galaxy is filled with 96% dark matter that is called dark for a reason so yeah totally makes sense and your skin also starts rotting in outerspace too serious case of leprosy then? i liked elektra more than this id rather have watched that five times kind of feel like that says something the only reasons i smiled or laughed was because the directors and script writers were decent at making corny jokes puns and lines funny enough that giggling is impossible prevent unless you are emotionless they should have gone with comedy rather than actionadventure though since i sincerely thought the rest of the moments were just junk call me a spoilsport if you must but i was literally whispering what would happen in the next minute to my friend beside me usually im not very good at predicting what happens in films unless they are seriously full of clichswhich this film is but i said them anyway i was right 8 times out of 9 i counted anyway though the beautiful graphics did rival that of avatar the plot of saving the people from the evil mastermind only this time it involves the whole galaxy instead of just one planet so its not just earth thats being targeted this time so ha we are different never got this tiring i was so close to sinking in my chair and dreaming up a nightmare because of how stupidly predictable this film was maybe that was intentional and marvel fans just wanted to see some new more unique heroes this time and also to see the visuals and maybe to see chris pratt and zoe saldanas pretty buttsbut whatever i had half that mind prepared for a clichturned awesome movie when i walked in the theater i came out with my whole mind filling up and overloading with shame and displeasure so plot would have been old and good but it wasnt protagonists i would have cared for them more if the filmmakers didnt blow up almost everyones favorite guy and kept alive some peoples leastliked guys so yeah villains  oh my gosh no seriously? what even happened to the evil robot woman? did the filmmakers just completely forget her? music louder than inceptions horn and i loved that even though it had no tune couldnt stand this though but still be ready for some rocking 80s and 90s music that i would have downloaded if they didnt play those songs during totally inappropriate moments comedy relief my butt the only relief i got out of the soundtrack that isnt even their soundtrack hopefully they didnt violate any copy rights i mean if its these filmmakers i wouldnt be surprised is that im glad groot enjoyed himself visuals stunning that wasnt sarcastic at all at all what else? oh yeah unless you pay me a million dollars i would never watch the sequel so sorry i cant contribute ten dollars for marvel next time tough luck dont let this review stop you though most of my friends liked it and of course most people who reviewed this movie liked it so i guess im just a jerk im betting you readers agree and thats totally understandable since i am totally venting but hey three out of four of my friends never watched a marvel movie so call me bluffing but i sincerely experienced one of the deepest disappointments i have ever dealt with in regards to a movie franchise in my entire life  im still going to watch xmen though dang you marvel
