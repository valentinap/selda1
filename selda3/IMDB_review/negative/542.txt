a good friend of mine the writer mark shulman once pointed out that our standards are being gradually eroded so that sadly we are left with less and less in lieu of a threshold of acceptability finding ourselves not unlike frogs in a pan being brought to a slow imperceptible boil christopher nolan and some of his cast are telling the press that interstellar is a love story i will take them at their word and assume that whatever else i picked up on was left there unwittingly for the rest of us to parse through considering how much pain is involved in traveling to and from a crowded movie theater on a saturday night i feel like its my prerogative when i have paid good money to take a film apart if i am still hungry for substance at the end of it and i will get my nourishment from something or other if not from the movies plot itself the first thing that strikes me when i think back to the experience of interstellar is that it leaves me with nothing emotionally  no takeaway i did not care about any of its characters or believe they were real and i did not really worry about the fate of humanity any more than the film itself actually does beyond paying it casual lipservice i wasnt awed like i may have been by other wondrous space movies that interstellar measures itself against or steals from and i am not compelled to go back and see any part of it ever again i suspect most viewers wont either once the collective neophile contact high has passed for starters i do not like the moral core of the story interstellar is a film about saving humanity but it is unclear who will pay for humanitys failures the film offers a great debate over where to repopulate but none about what we have learned from having to leave our home in the first place there is no therapy no penance no sacrifice in a way this represents a subconscious confession about our cultures moral failures when we run out of spaces to consume and out of fertile ground to slash an burn we will have to look for new worlds to expand out into since we cannot show self control and learn to care for what we have but enough psychobabble a dysfunctional moral compass is not the worst thing about interstellar the worst thing about the film is that to quote my girlfriend its ok to for characters to talk in pseudoscientific gobbledygook when the show is star trek because in star trek they all have pointy ears interstellar may be worth a glance certainly for the photography and exciting visuals but it is a buffet of messy ideas that fire in all directions clearly the script is not written by career screenwriters but by a director who has freed himself from gravity and has achieved his own artificial selfsufficiency amid the vast nothingness the result is an often farfetched and unintelligible outlandish tale which takes an awfully long time to suspend the viewers disbelief and cringing to finally arrive at a tepid plot after about an hour or so in hindsight it makes perfect sense that nolans tightest film is memento a discognitive story told from the point of view of a man who is unable to string two events together or to remember where he started interstellar is not an intelligent picture but a pseudointelligent one it seems designed to appeal to the sort of audience who loves to be flattered with cheap shots  a sort of space odyssey version of who wants to be a millionaire? its success resting entirely on the fact that every member of the audience gets to feel superior to whom? no one knows this technique seems to be trending within the nolans filmography for the rest the picture is a narrative mess that trivializes space travel on a galactic scale black hole wormhole same difference and is often plagued by ridiculous starstudded cameos that shatter the viewers concentration by landing in the middle of tense emotional scenes like a cockroach in your soup the film is oddly timed with elliptical cuts that compress the action into some often confusing edits and only leave in lieu of dialog some awful scenes of trite contrived exposition filled with emetic pseudo physics sure to give an immature modern audience raised on batman a sense that they are building their cultural ego by agreeing with this farce worst of all it feels long and never ending sadly good science fiction is hard to come by harder than a good ordinary film even and although this picture is somewhat entertaining it fades away from the heart and mind like the flickering green of the traffic light we just passed as we head home from the cinema once more
