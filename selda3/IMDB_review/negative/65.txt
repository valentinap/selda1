this movie was awful i was deceived by the fake rating it was full of pseudoscience so superficial and boring every single minutes could be challenged by a science professional being a phd student in science i envy scifi script writers and directors that they can pop up any bullshit and be praised by nonprofessional audience such a ridiculous robot underground nasa that launches billion dollar projects in famine a condition the huge tide on that planet without considering the depth of water entering the blackhole unprotected love being the 5th dimension contacting through blackhole by pushing the books oh my can anybody be more superficial about science? my advice to anybody who has a critical mind dont waist your time
