the first 10 minutes made me think this was going to be a great movie worthy of the high ratings given by those on imdb however i can just barely see its value as a unique story through the lame dialogue and ridiculous plot it was too difficult of a film for me to enjoy i stuck with it but was thoroughly disapointed midway through the film good performances but other than thatcertainly no where near my top 250 films
