as the title suggeststhis show is trying much to hard to live up to other titles in the dc universe the dark knight smallville and the also overrated man of steel it is too dark and gritty that it detracts from the overall narrative if the show were a bit more lightheartedthen maybe the arrow would character would be more tolerable as the show continues queens back story just seems more and more contrived and begins to lack purpose the abundance of the flashbacks per episode also gets to be distracting the only character on the show who isnt completely one directional is felicity she lights up any scene shes in and makes the show a bit brighter which i feel it needs more of however those are short lived and quickly dismissed by testosterone filled fight sequences that are difficult to see because again its too dark if the show stopped trying to take itself so seriously like a drama and more like a comic book series then it would a much better and enjoyable show
