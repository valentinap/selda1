ill start this with the good points angelina jolie does an absolutely amazing job as the dark fairy maleficent the various acting jobs range from acceptable the three fairies to quite impressive maleficent and aurora in particular also the effects and design are simply gorgeous the magical effects and creatures are wonderful and just look great now the bad i had really hoped disney was above the trend of gritty rebootsremakes but i have been sorely disappointed the draw of maleficent in the classic sleeping beauty was how incredible a villain she was she was just plain evil by turning her into a character who is not only sympathetic but eventually heroic this movie does a great disservice to the character who invoked all the powers of hell to ensure her victory maleficent watches over the young aurora keeping her safe while the three bumbling fairies maintain *complete* uselessness for the sake of comic relief eventually after she and aurora meet face to face maleficent begins to lament her death curse even trying and failing to undo it by the end of the film one is supposed to be rooting for maleficent because the kingdom of humans is corrupt greedy and evil the king completely insane i cannot imagine what executive thought this would be a good idea but it falls prey to gritty reboot syndrome resulting in something that feels more like character named after the ones in that other movie instead of a different interpretation i dont quite mean to say that the movie should have been exactly like sleeping beauty but it just shows no respect for the classic in the first place dont waste your time
