too much hype to take this film serious people were crazy about this film even before it released talk of an oscar for heath ledger before this film hit theaters will respect to heaths death but i think his death gave this film a bigger boost and expectation once the film came out i didnt find it that much different than any other action film it was just one explosion after another the performances were strong by everyone except for maggie gyllenhaal though better than katie holms performance doesnt mean it was a good one there was something that bothered me about christian bales voice when he was batman as bruce wayne it was normal but when he was batman it was a complete change to a lower aggressive voice that didnt even sound like bales voice at all it sounded bad then there is heath ledger it was not a bad performance at all in fact it was rather great at times he took the joker character to an all time low and gave it a more sadistic gruesome feel but to discredit what jack nicholson did for the character 19 years ago is not right jack gave heath a blue print on how to play the character and heath took it to another level i really dont think its oscar worthy like everyone is preaching for but it is a fine job by ledger i really dont understand why fans are treating this like the second coming of christ or something calling it the best film ever a masterpiece the greatest super hero movie ever it should knock titanic of the top of the box office cause its a better movie its all a little premature if you ask me if degrading other movies or other actors to make this film look good is people best review of the dark knight then they are pretty closed minded the dark knight is a damn good action film nothing more nothing less
