this is the movie that proves what many people by now have already realized people are being payed to write 10 stars fake reviews let me tell you this this movie is really not that great first its too long it takes one hour just for the space mission to start its slow paced and very sentimental or in other words most of it is boring im not an english native speaker but my english is not bad either i have no problems watching movies in english and yet it was very hard for me to understand the main characters mumbling in his farmer accent all other actors spoke properly except him the most important one the plot is not very logical planets just in front of a giant black hole? yes this must be the place to live everybody is dreaming of imagine your colleagues in the space station would say to you ok were now ready to fly down to that planet you wait here dont worry well come back soon in some years youd probably smile and say wonderful ok go now right? one day they come back and are probably surprised to see you havent committed suicide because of depression even though you waited 23 years  for them you must be the most patience man in the entire universe and again a female scientist who looks like a model and behaves like an amateur an obligatory part of every scifi movie nowadays this is just to give you an idea there is much more so read the other negative reviews good night and good luck
