 i cant talk about the thousands or more positive aspects of this film when so many people are so overly optimistic about it and completely blind to its sometimes unacceptable flaws when i saw it i wanted to spit at the moviescreen its a truly great movie but there are so many stupid unnecessary faults and flaws preventing it from being perfect that you just gotta hate it doesnt people see the excessive use of cgi graphics making this film look like final fantasy dont you see that what you just think it looks cool wow look what they can do those special effects guys dont you realize no one will be impressed by the effex of this movie in 20 years those of you who havent read the books how can you like this at all as just a movie cuz it isnt even a movie its a really detailed animated synopsis of the books the three of them that is and not really accurate at that ever wondered where the drama went the depths of any scene or character the direction and exhibition if i can use that word of the parallel story lines or are you just revelling in the roller coaster ride feel to the film the cool effects weaponry and armour digital creatures the battle scenes and the heroic speeches with the typical romantic gaze of the eyes looking out over the horizon i actually usually enjoy the latter things but its just too much here and not good enough this really is true porn for the mid teenage rpg junkie and immature and nerdy men are you really that superficial cant you smell the melted plastic sure this truly is a gourm‹© dish all the more reason not to have any funny odeurs interfering with it this review wont be helpful to most of you of course cuz yall are probably like everybody else i just needed to spread my word get it off my chest peter jackson deserves all the respect he can get and the actors are really great and perfect for their roles but dont over do it this trilogy film is not the best movie ever made not a chance princess mononoke and spirited away each carry more depth than all three parts of lotr together its magnificent and overwhelming but not brilliant a film of this magnitude shoulnt leave anyone unsatisfied but it did at least with me cuz it didnt live up to its potential and it wasnt even better the the prior part so of course i was mad at it how couldnt i be how couldnt you be its like youre fanatical muslims or christians and this is the holy bible or coran you cant even question it or criticize it wake up
