 actually i was hoping for a grand finale since the first installment was a glorious epic tale and the second was a piece of rubbish i was thinking that this moive would at least save the triologys face all starts good with a nice version of the becoming of gollum but to my dissapointment once again the story is told with the use of too much action scenes and some bland conversations and a gruesome amount of corny one liners the feel of an epic dissappears the moment the first flashback comes and the undeniably bad actress liv taylor makes an appearance yuck adn whats the deal with eowen she was alright in the two towers but now she suddenly becomes this girl power icon im not a man she says and slays a nazgul so what you say well its not the fact that she isnt a man that kills the witchmaster but the fact that its a elven blade that strikes him and if i recall it correctly its merry who deals that strike if the movie only would of stayed true to the book why doesnt it this was a once in an eternity opportunity and that dork peter jackson blew it as a movie fan im appaled and as a tolkien fan im angry rape
