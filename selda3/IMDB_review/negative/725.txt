how long was this awful film almost 4 hours the last 30 minutes were really taking the mickey in no uncertain terms the ring gets destroyed thats it movie over we really dont need to see sam & frodo get saved by eagles or them return to hobbiton or see bilbo & frodo leave with the elves does that even happen in the book the end of the film drags on far too long also the build up to the 2 main big battles drags on far too long as well if you are going to adapt a very long novel learn from frank herberts dune which originally was 8 hours long when dino delaurentis shot it dont bother
