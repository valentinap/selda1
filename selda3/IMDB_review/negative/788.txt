this film stands out like no other as an utter piece of shte when i see all the accolades and devotion that film receives it makes me want to vomit not only all the bile in my body but the blood that is contained in it as well pulp fiction is a testament to our downward spiraling american society it is a monument to the shallowness the arrogance and vapidness of our self obsessed culture that dwells in the american consumer mind only in america a talentless director whose only ability is to plagiarize greater works can become the most celebrated creator to ever enter film making but you cant say a word because his following is ravenously sycophant they know ever word every phrase every bit of dialogue but they certainly dont know the difference between the real deal and a cheap imposter sam pekinpah never sat down watched a slew of movies and said im gonna steal this scene or that dialogue from this movie and directly put it in my movie nope he created his own stuff he may have sat down and wanted the same feelings to be interpreted in his films but never exactly the same way neither did sergio leone john carpenter george romero ringo lam bo arne vibenius simon nuchtern the shaw brothers joseph sargent akira kurosawa fran‹_ois truffaut or even robert aldrich even george lucas after the atrocities that he has committed to his own films in later years has done this most of the names that mentioned are probably unmemorable or unrecognizable to most people but they are in fact only a few in a very long list of directors whose have been stolen by tarantino except of course george lucas so far anyway anyways that does not mean his movies do not have merit the earlier ones like pulp fiction are laded with quirky and funny dialogue but thats all they have because plot characterization and substance have gone out the door tarantino cant even tell you a linear story he uses a disjointed structure to hide the weak plot he uses clever dialog to take place of decent characterization in fact the funniest thing to me is that his seem to have a non stop spouting of words they never seem to stop talking but in the end they never really have anything to say
