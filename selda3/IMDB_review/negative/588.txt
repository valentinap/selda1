i dont know about anyone one else but when i watch a film i have one goal to be entertained i can say without any reservation i was not entertained for even one minute during fight club what really shocks me is that this film is rated so highly apparently so many who have watch this film find the bizarre so appealing to me a film is good when its entertaining you know enjoyable to watch i found nothing even remotely enjoyable about this film fight club is nothing more than a film about dysfunction and lots of it bizarre hallucinations and violence is this thought provoking or intelligent sorry i dont see that my recommendation if youre a person who looks for true entertainment in a film look elsewhere i am definitely worse off for spending 25 hours on fight club i give it 1 out of 10
