this movie doesnt know exactly what it wants the movie is very slow on pace i actually like the kind of movies that first try to build the characters and make you delve into the atmosphere this movie wasnt building any character or atmosphere but what it was building is total boredom i didnt want to watch this movie till the end but then i thought about the high points that people have given it and some of the reviewers were talking about its great twist ending but the ending alone couldnt save the 90% of this movies boredom i really feel cheated i want my money and above all 139 min of my life back that i wasted on this crap my advice to you people who havent seen this movie please dont waste your valuable resources on this crap
