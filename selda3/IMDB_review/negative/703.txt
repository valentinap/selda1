 first the good things this people who made this movie really tried and put effort into what they were doing they get an a for effort maybe they tried too hard the good things about this movie come from the book the story the inspiration every good line every good scene what the movie brings to this story is not good it manages to make each chapter into a long drawn out mess its tiring to watch a super close up of some heroic figure speak a overly dramatic line delivered in some pseudo shakespearean delivery again and again watching elijah wood furrow his eyebrows for 2 hours almost drove me insane aragorn and his accent were to avoid exaggeration pretty annoying thanks to liv tyler for some super uninteresting words whatever they were something about love and forever yada yada yada that being said boromir and a few others had some memorable lines what passes for action is hyperbolic cgi silly costumes i loved seeing goblins prance around like broadway dancers and kung fu blockbuster style action scenes if you have scene any movie with swords and or fighting in it then youve seen this before if you like mtv video games or crack you will like this movie it is a triumph of using good books as an ingredient in the big movie formula you can rent this and spiderman 2 all in the same day then go download some britney spears pictures all entertaining for about 5 minutes if you are over 16 or you are looking for something interesting or new pass this by
