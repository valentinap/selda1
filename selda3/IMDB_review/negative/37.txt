watched gone girl last night  absolute pile of garbage odd film that doesnt know what it is tries to be a parody of the modern world where the media subverts any notion of the truth but the characters are nowhere near defined enough and so we never buy in to it well i certainly didnt no real development behind the break up of the couples relationship  one minute theyre having sex in a bookshop next thing hes lost his job and they hate each other silly things like the way the pike character drops her hidden money during the crazy golf scene the way she eats a lot and dyes her hair but still looks like the absent wife and the jelly baby scene with the lawyer very contrived  worst case of plot manipulation since crash as for pikes certain oscar nomination its a really bad version of glenn closes routine from fatal attraction blank expression and the odd violent outburst does not an oscar performance make best bit in the film was the mistress breasts which were a major highlight considering the dullness of the movie  to quote the pike character the girl with the giant cumonme tits very astute shame fincher wasnt as perspicacious
