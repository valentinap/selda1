i love good superhero films captain america superman iron man this is not one of them if id been alone i would have walked out and the last time i did that in a cinema was for the wedding singer its not without merit but with $170 million spent i would hope not the design overall is very good the effects also and unlike some i liked chris pratt and the ronan actor but the attempted humour in the dialog is supremely irritating and the racoon characters grating voice was enough on its own to make me hate the talking scenes the film is so derivative it could have been assembled by cut and paste but at least it does not take itself seriously we are thankful for small mercies enough said i will go out of my way to avoid james gunn films in future
