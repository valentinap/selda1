this back show is terrible they have the spoiled rich boy coming back to take vengeance on the evil rich friends of his parents which plays well to the obamaera class warfare but little else the core seems to be if you got rich you did evil to get there really? he cant fight crime he has to be on this vendetta crusade? plus there is the whole thing of the constant flashbacks to his life on the island brought in every episode couldnt just tell us the back story in one episode? this is such a disappointment after smallville was brought to the network i had a hard time watching it bad scripts bad plots and acting that would do 1966 william shatner proud all top this off
