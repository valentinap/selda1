 really a great film but does it really deserve 6th place in the top 250 an perfect action packed film with the emotional charge of a mosquito imdb publishes weighted vote averages rather than raw data averages various filters are applied to the raw data in order to eliminate and reduce attempts at vote stuffing by individuals more interested in changing the current rating of a movie than giving their true opinion of it my vote 1 10 just because the rating is flawed try thinking that mostly internet users are aged ~ 20 or less and ratings based on mere numbers do poor justice to films the masses never saw
