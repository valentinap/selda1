this two hour version is a terrible war movie very violent and i wouldnt want my kids to go through what we went through watching these six piles of garbage the empire strikes back 30 minute version that garry hixon put in his files after innerspace is really really a masterpiece unfortun ately disney would not allow it to actually be released i only get about 30 hits a day on my 4 videos and im sorry to say dont have the money to release too many more but theres always hope i really enjoyed the exp erience in 1980 but i was a dumb kid stoned on marijuana and acid the computer graphics were very avante garde at the time its definitely a love story compared to my version but is is very long and very boring there version of the force is levitation which is not the force the force is feeling it feeling it and not using the ability too often then levitation is possible thank you disney love cinderella
