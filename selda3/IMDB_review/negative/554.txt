after having my little brother and friends hype the heck out of this film and claim it to be the greatest thing since sliced bread this came as a disappointment there were too many boring stretches for me and not much in the way of story it was like a no pun intended onepunch joke that fell flat about 30 minutes into the film brad pitt was good if out of place ed norton delivers his dialogue as if he were asleep and comes across as a secondrate john cusack wannabe helen carter is funny in parts and meatloaf is just hilarious thumbs in the middle for this one this movie fell flat at the boxoffice as struggling 20th century fox and this is not a bad thing tries to come up with fresh ideas to lure the teenage audience without having to recycle 30year old sciencefiction films
