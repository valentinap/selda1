if director david fincher wanted us to honestly believe that we have not evolved one bit from the scum that at one point inhabited this earth than he has brillantly done it the first problem i have with this film is that it drags on about a half an hour to long and trust me that half an hour at the end could possibly be the stuipidest ending ever what starts off as a promising look at a bunch of low lives letting off some stream by beating the hell out of each other mainly due to the always great edward norton slowing take a nose dive into pure stupidity this movie becomes so trashy i had to take a shower directly after watching it to feel clean again the main problem with this film is that there is only about 15 minutes of fighting the rest is a bunch of losers running around the city destroying things and then turns into a comptly unbeliveable ghost story the film is not a complete watse though due to several amusing scene in which ed norton punches brad pitt in the ear and when pitt edits images of male genitalia into childrens movies but besides that this could very well be the worst movie ive ever seen so unless there is absolutly no other options steer clear of this trashy mess
