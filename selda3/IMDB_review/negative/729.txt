 peter jackson who is talented at one thing and one thing only spectacle finishes his hugely successful trilogy im so glad this less than mediocre hack was given the job of writing and directing the film adaptations of the some of the best written fantasy literature ever the innacuracy of the story shoddy pacing inconsistent characterization via poorly written dialogue and hugely misunderstood character relationships and statuses are the largest sins committed in this film but the problem goes deeper this is just another in a long line of films quite nicely summed up by the word blockbuster and quite nicely critiqued by the trio may it rip documentary the blockbuster imperative in which the course of popular culture is outlined as a quest for and to quench the thirst for excitement rather than enrichment thank you peter jackson for shitting on the world you are so over rated it hurts me and your movies will never stand the test of time
