i dont get the point with all that 11 oscars 9 10 on imdb but what this is sensed to be something artistic some postal card landscapes and ridiculous one liners damn try to be intelligent scenes about loyalty and all there is nothing in this movie nor in the two others that can let me say it is a good movie no plot no acting no directing there is nothing in this movie and i dont post that to provoke reactions i truly think it and i dont understand to be so isolated with this point of view there are well done heroic fantasy movies like conan the barbarian that are seen like average movies and this is put on a podium i hope im not the only one it makes wanna puke
