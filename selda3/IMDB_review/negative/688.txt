its an okay film epic and all of course the fact that its an epic like gladiator or troy doesnt mean its good troy proved that fact and alexander continued to prove it with one star antics to be quite frank peter jackson is an overrated director much like the lord of the rings movies are overrated movies if you notice all three are located in the top fifteen films this one happens to be ranked higher than greatly superiour films such as seven samurai schindlers list and even casablanca this is not the case with camera angles that make you sick utilising the admittedly beautiful landscape of new zealand to help push across into our heads the true epic feeling of middle earth but wait where are the interesting characters every one of them you feel so bored with by the time the first film is up you seem to hope that theyd be dead by the second one but no they come along to the third one to kick some sauron ass heres my view of lord of the rings a whole load of walking lord of the rings fellowship of the ring points there walks lord of the rings the two towers points there walks trips up walks on lord of the rings return of the king points there walks throws ring into mountain walks away take those completely identical scenarios and pile them up with useless plot for three to four hours per movie depending on which one you watch and i myself wouldnt touch the extended versions you really get the idea that the academy awards truly are flawed why look forrest gump won best film of 1994 instead of the shawshank redemption or pulp fiction titanic won best film of 1997 instead of la confidential and why lookey here lotr rotk won best ing film of 2003 instead of mystic river perhaps next year well have the constant gardener as the best film of 2005 that may actually redeem the oscars failing reputation a reputation that had truly fallen when they took this half arsed effort of a movie and worshipped it as best film
