months after seeing this film all i can remember about it was heath ledger as the joker everything else melts away i cant remember anything about growly batman or lame two face i remember that there were way too many characters played by elderly veteran actors and maggie gyllenhaal looks like someones elbow and it felt like the film was ending so many times only to launch into a whole new chapter i know this is how comic books are written but the sprawling structure doesnt work as well in a film the storyline was messy only one star the joker
