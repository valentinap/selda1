i waited with great anticipation for this movie and was sorely and truly disappointed i dont understand where the 10 reviews came from? what planet were they on perhaps they were from viewers from the other side of the worm hole or black hole i have been a sci fi fan for many years but this movie took a leave from all logical or good sci fi explanations plot was ambiguous storyline convoluted technology was not linear one sees a 20th century saturn v lifting the crew up to a 22nd century space craft sleep pods with crew jumping into them like they are going for a nap exploratory craft that operate like a star wars movie landing on a water world with some silly time dilation theme that doesnt affect craft in orbit? cant these people survey the world from orbit? black holes 5 dimensions with metaphysical connection shameless referrals to 2001 it was embarrassing on and on for way too long han zimmers music score was good with a few good special effects but that was it
