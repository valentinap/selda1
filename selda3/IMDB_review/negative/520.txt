as you can probably ascertain from my title sentence i am not a fan of mr nolan however i dont have any bias prior to watching his films in fact quite the opposite i want to like his films as i really like his ideas and concepts which is why its such a shame he never delivers i also seem to be in a minority with my views as his films seem to have mass appeal certainly if you look at money they make but so far they have all left me cold interstellar tdk and inception all have similar flaws on the positive side they are all really cinematic stylish and well filmed they all have really atmospheric music and nice special effects on the negative side the plots are terrible and make no sense the dialog is flat and unrealistic there is no charisma or charm in the films they are functional and soulless and they lack any real depth or meaning the characters tend to be robotic and cold not warm or humorous the problem is when you put these two elements together you basically get high expectations that something great is going to happen but ultimately nothing does so it becomes a major let down on to interstellar specifically warning spoilers a plenty the first hour of the film was very boring and very silly the earth is running out of food so people still plant huge fields of crops which they destroy when driving through them for no good reason they have completely automated the process of farming crops yet they dont need scientists or engineers they need farmers which makes no sense if the earth was starving then the crop fields would be fenced off taken away from farmers and it would be a controlled process scientists and engineers would be the most valued members of society if the crops were so valuable they wouldnt be exposed to the elements and the dust they would be covered and protected everyone is so worried about the food shortages they dont take any notice of it instead they drive around in huge petrol driven suvs from 2014 wheres the google cars or electric cars? heres an idea you now have the ability to hibernate on spaceships so apply that to the population of earth and reduce the need for food anyway lets move on they go into space arrive at some place and immediately land in some water do they survey the area first check out the planet and landing area first in detail nope they just land now i know there is time pressure but why havent nasa sent numerous robots into space to visit these planets and send back information anyway this drags on a bit they visit another place which is another disaster and then we get to the point of the film only after about 2 and a half hours cooper flies into a black hole where he would normally be crushed and killed instantly but survives in some kind of advanced framework where he very predictably sends the already sent messages back to his daughter after this there is a very silly ending even though he is outside of time as it were and he can send messages to any point he cant for some reason stay in the same time as his daughter and how stupid was the 1970s minecraft designed robot in the end the visuals and atmospheric music was great but the plot soul and charm of the film was completely missing unfortunately like all nolan movies
