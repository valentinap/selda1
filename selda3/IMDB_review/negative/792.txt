the godfather all in all is a great movie and the best in the organised crime genre but putting it as the number one movie in the top 250 films of all time and the top of countless lists is too much the roles of marlon brando and al pacino are excllent but the film on a whole is very over rated the direction is good not excellent the script is by no means ground breaking but many people still refer to it as the best film ever made next time you watch this movie compare the script to something with more life and witeg fight club and more lavish directing
