i was not going to watch this movie because the previews did not appeal to me and i am probably the only woman living who does not think that brad pitt is sexy however i have heard several people tell me what a good movie this is and more than half were women so it came on cable and i decided to watch it at 2 hours i turned it off and i was sorry that i waited that long i kept hoping that it would get better i understand the materialism is bad theme i also understand the concept of ed nortons character having everything but feeling so lonely and depressed that he starts fight club with brad pitt in order to get attention and feel wanted what i dont get is after starting the fight club why start making bombs and blowing up buildings so the point that i get from this movie is that it is ok to start andor join terrorists organizations because someone is unhappy pathetic and generally miserable with their life i guess that all the folks that found this movie appealing and humorous did not have friends or love ones in the world trade towers or the pentagon because wasnt it a bunch of unhappy miserable materialisthating people that bombed both of those places the only thing that makes me depressed are movies like this
