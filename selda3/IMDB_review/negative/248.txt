most overrated show ive seen ever i know that a lot of tv is awful but gets swallowed up because people do not venture far from the mainstream dumbed down hypnotic crap which constantly flows through the screen like a sewage pipe however i did not know that the amount of people who are this uncultured and blind to any critical thought was this huge imdb used to be still is in many cases its a good site either way a reliable source for figuring out whether a showfilm was worth looking into put seeing the high ratings of arrow which is 82 at the time of this being written and the latest hunger games movie ive lost hope the spoiler free premise rich brat kid goes on a boat trip with his dad hes got a coke problem and lacks moral and discipline boat sinks everyone dies except him he manages to maroon himself on an island during this time he somehow manages to survive without any food nor drinking water and probably with some bad coke withdrawal symptoms he makes a bow out of what he can find on the island gets really good at hunting animals and survives long enough for another ship to find him well this doesnt seem too bad leaving out some of the backstory and other revelations of course but for some reason he is now a parkour master with martial arts skills hacking skills did he practice on a homemade computer he built out of wood and bear skin or something maybe he powered it by putting a propeller in a tube and farting really hard to make a windturbine? now what he should have done on that island is trained on his damn acting because it blows if i was an actor in la trying to make a name for myself i would of bought the boxset and hit myself in the head repeatedly until i died from head trauma but if that isnt horrible enough the entire cast share the most stale unnatural awful awful acting abilities as the lead it wouldnt have surprised me if the director got blown by every single member of the cast to be on this god forsaken show its just so sad to see resources which could have fed starving children go to waste on this melodrama of an actionshow too bad dramas require acting which the cast does not suffice to provide it should be called bags of skin who might actually be robots reciting the terrible writing of a talentless person on camera held by another talentless person who somehow managed to get payed and recognized in a extremely tough business instead of acting in this case the style of this series is extremely similar to smalville with a lot of bright light and water drops in the eyes of the pretty female actresses to make them look better which is the one thing they actually can do for the most part with the oily 80s pornflick filter and the halfarsed special effects though smallville actually being a half decent show gets a pass there was one scene i laughed out loud at it wasnt actually the scenes where the directorwriter intended it to be funny because those scenes were so tryhard funny that i literally cringed it was a scene where mr arrow shoots an arrow next to this generic bad guys head the bad guy says hah you missed whereas mr arrow replies i didnt lol apparently he shot the the arrow which actually had a flashdrive instead of a tip into the usb slot behind the bad guy which also contained a virus which mr arrow had taught himself to program on the island or something? which brought down the evil database epic haha great writing indeed no clichs included i actually dislike this series so much i feel good writing how awful it is maybe i can discourage a single person to watch this lobotomy of a show and that would be enough to make me feel glad tldr horrendous acting clichridden awful holeridden unoriginal and uninspiring writing horrendous acting overrated by people who would drink the koolaid as long as the trailer had explosions in it directing and special effects on high school film project standards thats actually insulting to high schoolers since they actually have creativity sorry acting horrendous terrible makeup jokes and humour about as hilarious as reading obituaries acting horrendous
