despite the hype i went to see interstellar hoping for the best from the dreadful opening which went on forever featuring insipid dialogue and portentous acting by all involved to the crude miniatures in space clearly an homage to kubricks 2001 a space odyssey which accomplished far more with far less technical advantages than todays filmmakers the movie incredibly got worse and worse until the last 30 minutes with some inspired redemptive spacetime scenes but oh that insipid dialogue and mcconaughys western drawl and baleful looks echoed by a truly wasted anne hathaway who also walked through her lines the real culprit is the editing as if nolan was so in love with his work he could not bear to cut a scene and the music? so banal that it managed to be predictable and intrusive at the same time i couldnt wait for the space scenes to begin but from liftoff to deep space they could have nasa footage instead i just cant imagine how anyone could call the space scenes thrilling or the twists and turns of the plot gripping whether or not you liked gravity at least its space scenes were in your face and hardedged watching the interstellar space station cartwheel through space like a miniature toy out of a cracker jacks box was simply embarrassing the scene of mcconaughy and hathaway begging mat damon not to activate the airlock because it wasnt sealed was just another example of nolan trying to manufacture excitement instead of being a hoped for surprise the result was not only something we have seen in many scifi space movies but as an experienced astronaut and pilot damons character would absolutely know would happen there were so many wooden moments its hard to count the best was when mcconaughy walks into his sisters hospital room and the reaction from her friends and family is absolutely zero not even a cocked head what a colossal waste of time talent and money to create something so utterly unforgettable you just cant create a profound movie by hoping characters can talk their way through it nolan may have had a good story in his head but what a messconfused poorly plotted no editing and a visual treatment and color palette that looks like it was done by amateurs 1 out of 10 and thats being kind
