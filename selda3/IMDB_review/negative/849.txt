before walking into this movie i really had great expectations what with the rave reviews the movie was being lavished with and the seemingly awesome trailer and then came the moment of truththe movie was very ordinary i saw nothing special in this movie for me to even remotely praise it it was long many gaps in the plot in addition to scenes and story lines which seemed senseless and had no follow up plus there really was nothing artistic about it and it didnt actually have the enjoyable cinematic experience moviegoers would want to relish in this was further aggravated with the poor lines in the film in short the movie didnt get me all excited or sucked me into it throughout the entire film i was hardly able to connect to the film that said however i wouldnt recommend folks to not watch it but just an advice to keep your hopes to a minimal point
