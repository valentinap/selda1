well this was a waste if youve seen the 1992 film the lawnmower man then youve seen a better version of transcendence thats right  jeff fahey outdid johnny depp if youve never seen that movie then you might say this film starts out with a relatively interesting concept however it ends in a twist that doesnt really make any sense based on the actions of the characters in the preceding 115 minutes of the film not one of the characters is interesting or likable the pace of the film dragged and all the members of my party seemed to be waiting eagerly for the film to be over dont waste your time or money
