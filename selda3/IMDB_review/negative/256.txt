maleficent was marvelously shot with beautiful effects and a dark and dreary setting that let you escape from your normal everyday world it even had some good performances but besides that dont even waste a dollar at redbox to see this piece of crap what in the world got into their head that made them warn to change the original character? in order to change that character they had to reroute the entire storyline and transform beloved strong willed characters into weak and stupid characters or good willed characters into evil one dimensions ions psychopaths and make a very important character pretty much pointless to the story okay from here on there are spoilers if you have not seen the movie do not read on maleficent was changed into a weak and clich_d piece of crap character to try in promote strong female roles in other films but she was only taken to a deeper level of weakness in the original she was strong and evil and she didnt have to have a back story because her story wasnt the main story she even turned into a stinking dragon in this version she was symbolically raped then she went all stereotypical and clich_ strong girl on us and decided to get revenge on her ex lover only this time she just cursed his daughter come on i mean thats not even exact revenge thats just stupidity if i were her idve killed the sucker immediately and just not worry about the daughter and then she tries to help the girl age cursed by attempting to break it how does being an antagonist with a heart of gold translate with audiences? uh not very well on top of that they changed her into a hero halfway through for no good reason at all except to make disney happy so its not like ultra dark unfortunately while doing this they ruined the dragon not only was maleficent not the one that transformed into the dragon it only took the soldiers like a total of 30 seconds to bring it down i mean seriously i counted then to top off this review i cant forget prince phillip the strong hearted prince who comes to save his true love for the evil sorceress only in this version hes a random guy who says hello to aurora once then gets this absurd infatuation with her and gets it into his head that he wants to kiss her then theres stephan and the fairies which if youve seen the movie dont even need an explanation
