 sam peckinpah is a movie director from 1970s known for the strong dose of violence in his films dirty harry series from the same era played by clint eastwood were not deprived of a good dosage of brutality eitherso are scarface and body double of brian da palma from the 1980s in all the above however there was either a plot or a theme or at least some atmosphere with a musical score on the other hand lacking the essentials of cinematography the violence in all quentin tarantino signed stuff is so excessive and over exaggerated that it becomes simply pointless and void a young couple takes on a journey and start a spree of serial killings just for the fun of it as in natural born killers one of kidnappers approach teasingly the abducted cop and slowly slices off his ear while singing and making dance gestures as in reservoir dogs still in this one a big fat black man is being forcibly raped by an effeminate looking blond man while in the next scene a man entering the room carves up one of the captors with a sword still in another scene having been shot in the groin a man groans with pain holding to his blooded genitals now i dont see where is the fun of in all these more important where is the art in all these so that almost all qt brand films have earned such high ratings apart from the frequent humdrum dialogs such as yep  yeah  right and a lot of profanity and abusive remarks what is the idea behind that violence and sordidness have become an integral part of american society well after all that is their choice and they have to live with that but at least dont sell this crap to elsewhere if you watch historical or war films or genuine mafia mob genre by masters such as scorcese or dilaurentis or coppola blood and gore unavoidably creeps in however there is a lot more than simple violence in them unlike the vulgar and infamous qt make i might sound a bit outdated by our modern society standards but somehow i dont fancy that type of meaningless brutality and gore committed by tacky small town psychopaths in confined settings such as warehouses or obscure small shops or drab us highways
