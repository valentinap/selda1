first the good kenneth branagh does it again diversity in hollywood i loved seeing all of the people of non white heritage spattered about the landscape as if they all belonged there coodles to mr branagh for always thinking outside the white box now the bad the movie itself this was the most boring thing i ever sat through and i think that everyone in the small audience i was in on discount day thought the same anytime people leave a theater without saying a word its bad the dialog was the worst ive ever heard lily james is also the worst actress ive ever seen the saving grace was derek jacobi as the king his relationship with his son was far more interesting than cinderellas relationship with her entire family then there was the endless narration doesnt branagh know that the first rule of storytelling is show me dont tell me i guess he forgot in this film the landscapes were pretty but i got tired of the endless stream of colorful gowns that were way too big on the bottom then there was the endless message of the film yes its a good message but a good message doesnt make up for a bad film as i quoted skip this and see ever after is was so much better at telling the cinderella story
