brian de palma has just ruined the originality of mission impossible jim phelps a traitor? seriously tom cruise is destroying one of the greatest imf secret agents now tell me jim has been a wonderful successful spy and a real handsome one at that and youre going to tell me a dumbass like ethan hunttom cruise is going to trick him? someone is trying to kill off the original mission feeling and replacing it with thick hollywood effects lightweight conceited actors like tom cruise and girls with fake boobs too reminiscent of james bond or any other typical hollywood wannabe spy film im so glad peter graves and most of the original actors didnt get themselves involved with this depressing movie the movie desperately tried to replace the characters with new ones but i dont think you can ever replace jim phelps with tom loser cruise or barney or paris or anybody i never liked tom cruise anyways the original tv shows were much better than these new movies vasically because they were intricately plotted had lots of wit and barely had these huge unnecessary explosion scenes which the new movies have so much of i think the only reason why this new piece of crap remake of mission impossible was made by idiots for idiots if you have watched the old 1960s mission impossible and liked it you may not like these movie remakes they are nothing compared to the intellect and intricate planning of the original and if youre a jim phelpspeter graves addict like me youll hate the movie even more
