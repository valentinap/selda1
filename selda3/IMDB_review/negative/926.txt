 let me tell you first and foremost that i have viewed plenty mafia movies not to mention i own several as well the first thing i have to say about the godfather that the entire plot is boring and drab its almost as the director is trying to make americans fall in love with criminalsnot to mention a bad display of italian americans were depicted in this film almost as insulting as goodfellas the question we must ask ourselves is are italians really that thick headed and vulgar and the answer is a resounding no you almost get the impression that vito corleone is a homosexual and that james canns character has a mental diffieciency the only good character depicted in the movie was al pacinos part a man who wrestles with his own personal demons family loyalty and the straight and narrow life i wouldnt recommend this movie to anyone and how it made number one is beyond methe only emotion it evoked in me was anger although it helped me to fall asleep which i thank francis for
