a not so unique mind thats responsible for polluting the world of cinema with an abomination that is the before trilogy strikes again by filming 2 child actors and 2 professional actors over the span of 12 years or so linklater has succeeded in producing a flick thats dramatically and cinematographically equivalent to average tv movies contrary to what most naysayers have said about it boyhood is actually loaded with drama and sentimentalism instead of nothingness the single mother the unreliable father the domestic violence the divorces the mothers plight in raising her two kids while attending college and finally getting a degree and becoming a teacher are some of the dramas thatas clichd as they might becould have been utilized as dramatic device yet the forced banalization of these events by jumping ahead year after year without actually showing how the characters process them made them almost invisible and frankly posses little to no emotional impact however its an admirable attempt to give the movie a touch of realism and accentuate how life could feel meaningless sometimes despite of the dramas that surround it still boyhood fails in making the events other than a few slides in a power point document for the reason mentioned before moreover linklater seems to realize this and tries to compensate it by forcefully including some laughable scenes that are intended to make viewers think that the characters lives are anything but meaningless or boring for instance the scenes with the restaurant manager who thanks the mother for her advice looks too much like one of the scenes from insipid motivational movies its a sad effort to make us appreciate small victories in our everyday lives not to mention quite condescending as if the viewers are a bunch of emotionally and spiritually challenged individuals who have no ability to realize such sophomoric life insight the last scene with the mother loosing her composure and starting rambling about how meaningless her life is despite of the ups and downs and all of dramas she has experienced just because her son is leaving for college reads like a desperate attempt from the directorwriter to give a sense of climax and closure lastly since the title of this flick is boyhood and the premise is a deeper look into a boys life from his perspective boyhood couldnt have been more distant in depicting the central characters inner turmoils well it was probably quite a task since the boy was so boring 110
