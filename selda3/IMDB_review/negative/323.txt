ill try to be as objective as possible here but unlike the premise of this film you wont be able to travel through a wormhole and warn yourself of the impending waste of three hours first im not a scifi fan but rather was a nolan fan so i did want to give this film a chance i dont claim to be a film expert by any stretch but this movie reminded me of a similar experience with the thin red line 1998 in that the entire film was a play on visual that subsequently lacked substance further the visuals in this film were extremely boring its outer space throw in something to look at even if outside of textbook physics with the exception of the black holes its literally black the entire time or a saturn backdrop they also poured in some heavy scores to make an attempt to glamorize the visual effects or lack thereof so earth is dying but they really never get into the whys and hows in an understandable fashion that would help to put into perspective the importance of finding another planet to live on life on earth seems to continue for decades after they start their mission which only exemplifies my point unless einstein himself wrote this script the dialogue in this film is meant to be so overthetop that nobody in the audience is meant to understand it nor question it i had an issue with the character development and lack of justifiable emotion at no point in the film do you really care about any of characters because the storyline goes around like a hulahoop good actors cant make up for their own lack of character development sure cooper cries when leaving his daughter but he is on a spaceship up in outer space before his daughter can grab a tissue to wipe the tears away i think what bothered me most and fits the theme for lack of visual effort were the stupid robots they are basically chrome atm machines with block appendages if i was going to cram a bunch of people and adequate supplies into a spaceship i wouldnt design the robotic assistance to be a huge box that takes up half of the cockpit pure visual lazinessr2d2 was more interesting while being created 30 years ago the more i write and think about this movie the more im reminded of how awful it was this to me was hollywood hyping something up and ripping off movie goers time and money
