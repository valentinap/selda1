okay this is a pretty good movie but i just find it hard to see it in the top five thus the low score although it certainly has a lot of great things about it there is a great deal wrong with it as well which i suppose must be expected from a film that is trying to condense 500 pages of literature into over three hours it must first be said that this clearly too long or at least there are points in the film were it does seem to lumber along it also seems that jacksons choice in which parts of the film were to remain in the final cut left out a great deal of interesting stories from the books and the ending is completely different to that of the book and unnecessary that said it is still an incredible achievement overall with excellent battle scenes and amazing effects surrounding an already lovable story but i still wish jackson had made more use of the characters its a great film to watch for sure much better then a lot of the stuff were seeing now but it still could have been a great deal better
