man oh man this movie was terrible how this got an 86 is beyond me and in fact thats what i went based off of and luckily never really go to movies now days because of all the crappy movies hollywood pumps out there is nothing to this movie i went with a friend and i literally kept falling asleep every now and then looking at my watch hoping it will be over its just an empty movie all action with no story nothing just some shooting here and there and stupid jokes all recent movies like this including the new amazing spiderman 2 are just terrible movies with nothing to them hollywood is just a cash cow now and this is why i refuse to pay for movies in theatres
