you cannot convince me they are not paying people to give this terrible film high ratings on the internet people gave it 10 it is unwatchable i dont worry about foul language for the most part but a lot of effwords in a movie clearly targeted at 1012 yearold boys is a bit much it was just plain retarded from the getgo and the performances from the actors was not even remotely up to snuff and i love michael caine mark strong and colin firth  i figured how can you go wrong? i truly cant figure out who the audience is for this garbage total waste of $11 bucks wouldnt have even watched it free on the internet
