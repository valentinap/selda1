 moves even further from the source material more so than the two towers by peter jackson and fran walsh too many elements are changed from the heart of tolkiens work sam would never have been turned away and by the way just how did he find that sword and the light of elendil in shelobs lair with no light source also shelob is spider like but not a spider there were no webs in her lair even worse is the acting of john noble as denethor yes denethor has despaired but int he movie his madness is related to his use of a palantir and competing against sauron saurons will was stronger and he bent denethor left him bereft of hope this movie he is a caricature a cheap poorly rendered badly overacted caricature faramirs character was assassinated in the second movie but it is his father who is torn asunder even worse in this one aragorn had the sword anduril after he left elrond and rivendell and says so in the the two towers before entering the hall to meet with wormtongue and theodenbook here it is given to him by elrond who never came to visit aragorn it was elronds sons and the remaining rangerswho allude to no longer protecting the borders of the shire foreshadowing the scouring and they brought the banner of the king not the sword aragorn acts like a haughty king in the paths of the dead where in the book the scenario is much more dramatic and better also the dead were released before the battle at pellenor fields after helping them capture the ships with black sails that scene looked like the frighteners part 2 absolutely ridiculous it is a pretty to look at movie with no substance when compared to the source material tolkien loved the scouring of the shire and felt it was the true climax of the entire work yet peter jackson called it a simple denouement and said he hated it the better story isnt in these movies and i hope that people can read with a finer eye than they watch these movies with they arent that good and each slips further down the first adaptation was the best of the three and this was the worst hands down
