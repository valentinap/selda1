this is the worst piece of trash ive seen in many a long year ive seen comments that the movie presents the shallowness and hypocrisy of the squares all around us and offers a way out through the infliction and receipt of pain in bareknuckled brawling with consenting partners sorry i cant see it that way all i see is a tiresome and unappetizing jerk who turns into a tiresome masochist with bruises there is nothing liberating in this piece of trash there is only an inauthentic jerk who turns into a more disagreeable inauthentic jerk given that it takes a lot of money and a lot of talented people to make a movie like this its incomprehensible how this piece of trash like this ever got made and even more incomprehensible how any sane and intelligent critic could find any redeeming qualities in it if the movie demonstrates anything its that lunacy and tastelessness has taken over the inmates are in charge and were all living in a lunatic asylum
