sorry but i cant believe that this is the most popular film it dragged on for so long i didnt even see the ending dont get me wrong i love gangster films but this was so unengaging and that by the time al pacino shot the bad copper i had to turn off the storyline just seemed to be so pointless that i didnt care about whatever happened to the characters how stupid is putting the horses head in the moviemakers bed he knew they were dodgey gangsters so why did change his mind i cant think of any reasons why this was a good film if you do then you better tell me
