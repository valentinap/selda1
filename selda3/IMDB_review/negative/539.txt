a simple farm guy named copper matthew mcconaughey and a few other experts go into outer space to explore other worlds that might sustain human life it seems that that life on earth might not survive due to to some unexplained environmental disaster naturally nothing goes right way overpraised and terrible scifi movie when i heard the plot from this i expected the worst writerdirector christopher nolan has never been a favorite for mei hate what he did to batman in his movie trilogy i thought that he as trying to imitate stanley kubrick 2001 here but its far worsehes doing steven spielberg the movie runs way too long 165 minutes and theyre constantly pushing family friendly values in your face coopers nonstop yammering about his daughter got on my nerves instantly also that stupid fake southern accent he adopts is immediately annoying the story is very slow and all the characters are cardboard cutouts youve seen in other movies the special effects are flawless and theres some beautiful cinematography here but the extreme length and boring story really weigh it down any sort of statement theyre trying to make on time and life is completely deadened by the script also this movie is very manipulative and way too sentimental they go out of their way to make the audience crylike at a spielberg movie well i did crytears of joy at the end that this was over also the gaps in logic and plot holes here are very annoying i lost track of how many times i rolled my eyes at the dubious logic served up here the acting was as good as it could be i guess but at the end they throw in a surprise guest star who i wont name it didnt help because i think hes a terrible actor and this didnt change my mind i was bored and looked at my watch many times while this played its boring obvious and manipulative why is this getting so much praise? skip it
