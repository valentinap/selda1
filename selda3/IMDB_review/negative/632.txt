this film has to be different then the book i notice the production cost and theater gross are way off which is what makes the most sense of this film this makes kubricks 2001 a masterpiece criminals should have time taken off their sentence if they can sit through this more then once some great movies do need to be seen 2 or 3 times to understand everything and it is worth it obviously not this someone thought they were being real dynamic deep brilliant putting this thing together when they were on lsd it seemed like the answer to the meaning of life when they came down it was silly nonsense too late the film was in the can it belongs in an ashcan i am sure there are many people who put this in a cult classic category they are on drugs and not even watching it the film actually would have been much better if it was another underground fight movie without the way overboard trying to be deep and multi faceted art it is not the high school chemistry did nothing to help the film the subliminal message before the credits was probably aimed at people who spent money to see it you got the shaft it sucks and others which cannot be printed here
