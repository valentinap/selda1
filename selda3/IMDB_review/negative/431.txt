i do not know what kind of pr team the production team has hired to promote this film but obviously they are doing great job as it has already higher score than inception seriously guys??? this film has 510 stars at best and even that for just potential rest of it is lost because the film has absolutely no logic to it stupid illogical and at times really boring and long even though i am no scientist it was so stupid on so many levels with even the most basic of facts that i have no comments to this set your expectations low no way in hell does this film deserve any of that praise posted here
