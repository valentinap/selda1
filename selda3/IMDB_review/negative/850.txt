bad parts of this movie the action scenes sucked other than at the beginning the action scenes consisted of the joker saying something stupid batman hitting him the joker hitting him back and then walking away and something exploding in a good movie the good guy is supposed to be a little weaker than the bad guy and has to overcome it but batman has radar vision and can fly while the joker has nothing but a knife this movie was not inspiring what does it inspire me to do pay a british douche a lot of money so i can dress up in robotic bat suits and catch criminals speaking of the bat suit if part of batmans sacrifice is that the city hates him then why does he have a special uniform if youre supposed to be hated by everyone wear a ski mask and stop advertising yourself if you are trying to be loved by the people then you can advertise the movie created so many dumb unimportant plot lines and nothing ended up happening right after the love triangle the girl died that guy said he was gonna reveal batmans identity but nothing happens there was so much that didnt make any sense how does one guy in hong kong do the accounting for all the criminals in gotham why is it the biggest problem in the world that 5 people were killed in 5 days thats better than things are usually in big cities why dont the gangsters the joker is talking to kidnap him etc the joker wasnt creepy there is nothing creepy about a guy wandering around in face paint and giggling if he walked in to a bar cut a guys head off and then ordered a salad that would be creepy a superhero should be a superhero because he did something cool batman is a superhero just because hes rich good parts the credits
