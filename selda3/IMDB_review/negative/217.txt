overall the movie was ok and i dont regret watching it it was entertaining and beautifully shot even if many scenes were referential to other movies as for the acting elle fanning was ok as aurora though the character felt a bit empty but to be fair there wasnt much in the script to work with i wish she had a little more to her than childish goodness there actually wasnt much for any of the actors to work with i wont lie im no fan of jolies acting she comes across as haughty in every role humility and vulnerability are completely outside her range but her haughtiness works here and she was good as maleficent except in the scenes where she was supposed to be angry i got no hint of her anger fire or passion she was merely shouting i wanted to feel her rage biggest problem with the movie is the number of plot holes there is no real explanation given for why the moors and the kingdom of men are enemies the king decides to attack for virtually no reason the relationship between stefan and maleficent is graced over and yet this relationship goes to the core of maleficents being we also see nothing of stefans life so we are unable to fully understand his actions and motivations stefan becomes mad and paranoid with no real love for his daughter and that just sort of happens i could go on and on about things left with little explanation another major problem i had was the previews of the movie lied to me in a big way the movie wasnt a retelling of sleeping beauty from mealficents point of view it was an entirely new story i wanted to find out why maleficent was evil  the maleficent i know and lovehate or hatelove i wanted to see maleficents evil with new understanding lets face it maleficent was nowhere near evil in this movie shes angry for a moment and thats it which lead me to imagine other ways to tell the story perhaps humans had seriously wronged her aurora was the child born to unite the 2 warring kingdoms of men and that maleficents plan was to stop this union for real substantial reasons  the story could have been easily told with a new perspective while being seamlessly woven into the known fairy tale every story has two sides right? in conclusion i wouldnt recommend this movie if they were going to deviate so much from the known disney or perrault version they could have fleshed out the story a little lot more
