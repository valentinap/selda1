i was actually intrigued by this movie a spy movie with action and comedy i love those types of movies the beginning started out good i actually liked this movie until all the killing dont get me wrong im not one of those antikilling people movie type person my problem with this movie is that the killing distracted me from the story the story lol especially the fireworks scene in the movie yes the special effects were cool in all but come on fireworks? when youre gonna kill a bunch of people you turn it into a fireworks show that part completely ruined it for me onto the story i got the basic plot of the story but once again the killing kept distracting me away from the story in conclusion the movie had a lot of potential but did not live up to my expectations i do have the admit cinematography was actually pretty decent compared to the rest of the film
