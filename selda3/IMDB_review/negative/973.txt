i sat through this movie yesterday the special effects and the visuals were great as in the previous two parts they are pretty much what you would expect after reading the books which i did a long time ago ok so everything looks nice but otherwise the movies had little to offer i do not want to bash the movies too much because they made such a good effort in illustrating the books so this will be brief some of the problems were that the characters are very thin the dialogue is terrible and the music mediocre at best the movies also have this tendency of just marching through the obligatory plot events at a rapid pace therefore while sitting through the movies i noticed i really did not care what happens to these creatures we are for example supposed to like the good guys because they are so beautiful handsome as opposed to the ugly bad guys and because we are told they are great but there is hardly any screen time for them to demonstrate any of these good characteristics as persons except for their nice manners compared with those of the bad guys i guess a 300 hour tv series might have been a much better format to fully present the material as long as they would fix the dialogue and the music but that would have been impossible
