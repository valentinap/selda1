one of the lamest most unconvincing pieces of video material ive been subjected to my stepson said it was good so i gave it a try its shite ive loved comics since early childhood so its another reason why i thought this would appeal to me its so repugnantly fake im at a loss for words youll be hardpressed to find a moment where you can get immersed and forget that its obnoxious actors on screen that youre watching i just dont know what else to add except to speculate what made it receive 82 rating from the audience women drooling over the protagonist? kids into parkour and commercial tunes? im baffled
