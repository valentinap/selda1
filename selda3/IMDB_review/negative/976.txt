i was born in 1984 thus when pulp fiction came outmy parents did not want me to watch itmy mom thought it was stupidin my junior year of high school i joined a dvd club and bought the movie with no prior viewingone of the dates ill never forget in my possession is the pulp fiction dvd the pulp fiction script which i opted not to steal a pulp fiction shirt a pulp fiction advertising down sized poster the american poster and the french cannes festival i have even flown to europe just to walk into a mcdonalds in france to see if the royale with cheese thing was true i soon found out with multiple pictures of the menu a physical copy of the menu hamburger wrapping with royal cheese on them and a receipt with my purchase of the royal cheese the virgin record store inside the louvre had the french poster i never realized after recollecting my purchases the strong impact this movie has made on me and the realization that it is quite possibly the greatest film of all time and only my obsession with mafia movies is the only thing keeping me from full blown ecstatic fanatic i cant believe the dialogue the portrayals the camera angles the whole plot how one man can dissolve this beautfied violence into existence overwhelms me its whole profound existence makes me proud just to be american how one movie can just hit every button on the perfection control panel is beyond comprehension god bless youquentin tarantino
