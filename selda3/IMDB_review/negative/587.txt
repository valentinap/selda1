i cannot believe this film is rated so highly granted there is a hollywood bias in this database but rarely is such an idiotic film given such accolades after seeing the poster for this film i had no interest in seeing it but i watched it on the advice of a trusted friend and was amazed at how much it was exactly as i had expected originally a macho guy film on a par with the die hards and lethal weapons of this world rambo too
