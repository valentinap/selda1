i went to watch this movie expecting it might be a decent scifi movie but it turned out to be yet another terrible crap here are the few reasons why i found it crap 1 if a guy fell in a typhoon a usual earth disaster it is most probable he will die but mr coop is made of some different material the guy went inside a black hole where matter collapse beyond nuclear and quark level but he comes out in one piece with all his consciousness intact this very presentation by nolan just cheapened the depiction of a black hole 2 so top notch team was sent out by nasa yet they cry and whine about so small issues like oh i want to see my daughter back even at my company of 16 people we act more professionally seriously people buy whatever crap is fed to them in the name of nolan
