 the star wars movies were the worst movies of all time science fiction by itself is bad enough let alone being a cult like nerd flick the music was the best thing and even that was melodramatic at times and come on whats the whole long time ago thing if we dont have flying machines now we most certainly didnt have them in the past ok so maybe the star wars movies dont belong on the bottom 100 but in the top ten is ridiculous what a protagonist i say as the great mavoric murdock said only the best will be the worst the irony in this comment is astounding for you see if the public does not recount the degeneracy who will let me explain for every brilliant movie made there are many more hidieous movies so then if there are an abundance of awful movies then mediocre ones will seem fantastic and good ones will seem godly for example the godfather my point is that the praise of star wars is merely a product of being surrounded by worse movies
