i ordinarily dont take the time to comment on things of this nature but this is possibly the worst movie i have ever seen fight club had absolutely no plot and no message to give to the audience it was replete with violence sex gore all with no purpose whatsoever the movie said nothing  it was just film and actors if i had to describe this movie in one word it would be gratuity there was gratuitous sex violence and blood and guts apparently a lot of people enjoyed this movie and i dont know what that says for our society and how easily we can be entertained this movie is a waste of anyones time i highly recommend that you stay as far away from fight club as possible
