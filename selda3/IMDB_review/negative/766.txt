more attention should have been paid to the eyes in the blue screen sequences in the film it is all too easy to see three distinct light bulbs reflected in the eyes if we are to believe the actors are on the mountain then they should not be lit as if they are in a studio at times i felt like i was watching a weather broadcast you know the ones where it is so blatantly obvious that that what is going on behind them is only a projection im sad to say that there is still a long way for cgi to go in terms of becoming believable
