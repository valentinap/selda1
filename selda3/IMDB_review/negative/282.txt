just because this movies gimmick was that it was filmed over 12 consecutive years so you witness the kids growing up does not make this a fantastic movie the script was awful and went no where it was nothing but a series of boring unending vignettes strung together to try and tell a story which it failed to do the characters are onedimensional uninspiring bland and apathetic what child when given a birthday giftteenager or otherwisehas no reaction as if heshe is in a permanent braindead coma? how is that just like real life ? those raving about this movie are just those trying to jump on the bandwagon of the emperors new clothes well spoiler alert the emperor is naked they are saying it is just like real life i dont know anyone who acts like what was portrayed in real life no one outside of patricia arqettes one outburst reacts with any kind of emotion passion or pathos i have had more entertaining experiences getting patdowns from tsa at airport security dont waste your money dont waste your time if you want to see a movie about kids growing up filmed over several years watch the harry potter series at the very least you will be entertained
