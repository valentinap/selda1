i will give this movie a 1 for visual effects only 1 because the director put the emphasis on these but stole ideas from avatar and man of steel  the flight looks cool doesnt it? other than that the movie is sending confusing messages to the ignorant people of our times who dont know that maleficent means one who does evil so  in anyones opinion  how can an entity that looks like a devil fairies dont have devilish horns and dark colored wings with ugly horns on them and is called one who does evil named from birth not after she suffers the deception how can such a person be presented as kind? honestly?? its something new from disney  to have a voiceover say in such a gentle voice hello dear stupid audience  heres our dear devil that we want you to love she looks ugly but try to love her love her horns love her ugliness love her evil name love her companion whos also named like a devil this is the new kind of love that were telling you its the real thing its in tune with the youths love for vampires werewolves and ghost stories that so many have fallen in nowadays
