this movie is overrated and frankly sucks as a film it has very few elements of a good film and was toooooo long anyone can make a good movie in about four hours the trick is to stay under three hours and still have a forceful impact the movie had too many fronts there were frodo sam gollum aragorn dead people mary rohirran and gandalf pippin the movie is good entertainment if youre willing to sit long enough lotr freaks have kept giving this movie a 10 making a mockery of the voting no thought is actually being given during voting and personally i think people should just give it a one just to counteract the false voting
