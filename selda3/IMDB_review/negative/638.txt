this is possibly the worst movie ive ever seen i hear its supposed to appeal to my generation im 22 since weve been brought up on a diet of senseless violence and mtv now i dont automatically think theres anything wrong with violence in movies as long as theres some justification for it and i like watching mtv when they actually play videos but i found this film terrible up until about the middle of the movie there might have been a chance for this movie to find itself and deliver some real social commentary which is the only possible reason other then pure sick voyeurism that might justify the horrific violence unfortunately fight club then took a turn for the worse not for the better and delivered an even more bizarre more violent ending save your money somethinganythingon tv or at the $175 movie theater is better than this
