 it is a great pity that people cannot distinguish between great works of literature and the failure to exemplify these works in the cinema graphic medium these three films adapted from the great work were shot on low quality film and in a manner to make the greatest profit from as much exploitation of its artisans as possible for example peter jackson knew that he could new zealand citizens to be extras at no costs due to the novelty of under taking such a project of this magnitude and glamor in a parochial isolated hometown new zealand countryside peter jackson fran walsh and philipa boynes bought the film rights of the great literature for a massive cost and then hired scriptwriters to prepare the screenplay adaptation in their names at great cost this was a very poor screenplay if you really loved the books and actually read them which most of the films audience probably never could or did how the motion picture academy members voted it best screenplay adaption and gave the award to these three people is rather suspicious the cinematography was very poor with many shots out of focus and overuse of various camera techniques this has been supported many cinematographers in many blogs the acting performances were very mediocre and the selection of actors was purposefully chosen from australians and new zealanders due to peter jacksons view that they are better actors than americans and the british in fact australians and new zealanders have this strange dislike americans despite consuming their films the animations of various creatures was so similar to the vampires in dusk till dawn it makes you wonder if the cgi people had much imagination the many gratuitously violent scenes not described as such in the books would have been very frightening to children let alone the ridiculous characterization of the golum in fact most of the cgi was carried out by americans hired by peter jacksons multi million dollar cgi suite which at the end of the day makes you wonder where mr peter jackson got the money to not only buy the film rights to the books but to build a multi million dollar film effects studio in new zealand the whole thing was obviously a massive profit making exercise in profit making with peter jackson and his mates securing huge merchandising deals in the planning of the projectit is further proof that the very wealthy and privileged can always demonstrate what their money can achieve not what they themselves can achieve due to any talent or real imagination it was not made for the sake of love of a great work of literature but for profit and self aggrandizement i fully understand that films must make profit but this one really couldnt go wrong with the material and the present day innovations in cgi i am certain that one day someone will remake it and do it properly and maybe some one like john boorman who was originally going to make the film i am so content in thought that there is a great difference between people like myself and the people who glorify this film and peter jackson
