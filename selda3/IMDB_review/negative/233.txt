ok i admit im a marvel fan seen almost all the movies and i know some movies are better than others i was quite surprised this movie got a 85 on imdb so it should be good right? my reaction after the last dance was seriously? marvel made this shyt? let me put this simple this movie steals like everything from the original star wars mixes an evil yonda not yoda in it together with pj the raccoon from over the hedge an ent living tree from lord of the rings and a little bit of star trek also the real bad guy gets the hammer of thor only a bigger one but thats a marvel studio idea already it could be a weird but good mixture but it ends up as a deadly cocktail where only the cgi is better than star wars and would actually deserve a better rating than 1 seriously this is a one to watch if you want to see marvels biggest blunder ever marvel isnt marvel if there wont be a sequel but i will skip that one on forehand leaves me to the question how the **** did this movie get a 85?
