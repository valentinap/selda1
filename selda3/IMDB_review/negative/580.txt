honestly this movie marks some fresh and new to cinema great film making style and plot direction and cast was good too but here comes the boomthis film represents the modern era where anything can be sold to the fools just by advertising and wrapping it in a catchy packing so while watching this movie i was feeling as if i am getting sick literally but i just watched it because of its high rating the film talks about releasing self from limitations and lack of emotional strength so far so good but a dying patient cant be cured by hypnosis it is a useless effort now our patient is dying death is playing its game and his relatives around himall those who loved the moviethinks that due to hypnosis their beloved patient is not crying that means not feeling pain that means getting cured now thats what i call fools gold honestly again but i am not buying this stuff
