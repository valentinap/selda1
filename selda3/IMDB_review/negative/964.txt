 so what im getting is theres this dominatrix running around with a cape funny ears and a husky scary arousing voice who also beats up guys in parking garages but none of them got aroused so the story didnt go anywhere she probably should have whipped them also there was this rich guy who it showed a lot but he didnt really have anything to do with the story it was strange but on the other hand there is that buxom green haired lady who gets beat by the dominatrix and then dresses up as a nurse id buy that for a dollar anyday i think the dominatrix probably should have got slightly naked shes got some big pecs if you know what i mean and i would have liked to find out if the carpet matched the drapes like thats the stuff i would bump into on the street by accident that gordon guy had a moustache that made me wonder but i digress there was a lot of teasing without any climactic moments of trepidating fulfillment or masochistic zeal i was appalled disappointed and finally ashamed it almost makes you wonder how director christopher nolan even thought he was making an erotic film
