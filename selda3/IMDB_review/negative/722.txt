to say that this movie is overblown pap is an understatement like its predecessors this flick employs just about every movie clich‹© in cinema history like long long death scenes fake death scenes how many times did freddo die only to our surprise hes really not dead at all  a mans gotta do what a mans gotta do scenes in fact what with the clip clop galloping of horses everywhere i thought it had strayed into a western ride like the wind type comments abound the mad bad king who dies a horrible death coz hes so mad and bad the cute little hobbits were all supposed to cheer for and even a darth vader type chief villaincoupled with a script that was so lame the better actors were really pushing themselves to the limit trying to make the lines sound at least half original in fact the only interesting characters in this enermous exercise in money grabbing movie cynicism were the villains the orcs at least had character not surprising then that the movie relies upon the gollum to sell it in years to come this lumbering saga of over hyped over produced trash will be not be regarded in the same way star wars is but in the same way titanic is bit of an embarrassment
