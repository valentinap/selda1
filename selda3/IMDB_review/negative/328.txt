if you like fairy tales and believe in love then youll hate this film its beautifully filmed and well acted by angelina jolie but the story is so over the top with the male hatred it becomes ludicrous by the end of the film i just started laughing at how insane it was made me think the writer just had to be a woman and she must have suffered the worst break up in history or else she just really hated men i was looking forward to seeing this film ever since it was teased in theaters now i wish i had my money back some may say this film is like frozen thats only if we discovered christoff was actually in league with the evil prince and olaf was their spy
