fight club 1999 stars brad pitt and edward norton when ed norton gets insomnia he starts to venture into another world when he meets brad pitt this movie makes no sense i had no idea where it was going i was very disappointed in the film i couldve wrote it better and more realistic i wish i didnt see this film i hated every second of it fight club has an interesting plot but i fail to see the actual validity of the punchline having said that i didnt like the film it just doesnt add up correctly if you watch each and every scene however we are watching it through the eyes of edward norton i dont understand all the hoopla over this film go watch the sixth sense for this kind of stuff and if you can believe this can really happenyou are an idiot
