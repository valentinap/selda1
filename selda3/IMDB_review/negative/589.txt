i for one hated this moviei only saw it once and it was a long time ago so forgive any incorrect references personally i dont know if i saw it again now if my opinion would be differentmaybe but somehow i doubt it the beginning was interesting enough to entertain mespecifically the whole him going to different group session things as a hobby and then meeting marla who does the same thing thats interesting i think the whole thing started to bore me about when the movie started going nowhere from what i remember it was just marla living there and brad pitt beating the crap out of edward norton every night or whatever it just lost its interest the end was a cool twist the whole tyler thingit was interesting but the film as a whole i dont think was just very well presented maybe if id read the book itd make more sense i just think i didnt like it because it didnt make sense to me i understand this makes me a bit of an outcast because everyone loves fight club but i apologizejust not my taste if anyone wants to just explain a few key points out for me or something thatd be great just please dont rip me a new one because i understand i am like the only one who doesnt like that movie slide
