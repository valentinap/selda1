 batman raises the stakes in his war on crime with the help of lieutenant jim gordon and district attorney harvey dent batman sets out to dismantle the remaining criminal organizations that plague the city streets the partnership proves to be effective but they soon find themselves prey to a reign of chaos unleashed by a rising criminal mastermind known to the terrified citizens of gotham as the joker we can all argue about the quality of this movie until the cows come home but this is what i saw i saw an extreme amount of violence in a kids movie its like making dora the explorer into punisher war zone and as far as flaws go this was jam packed there is this nerdy guy on tv who claims he knows who batman really is yet it goes nowhereit doesnt take an idiot to figure out that it would take a millionaire to afford that crap the cell phone gag was idiotic they actually could see everything including people who werent on cell phones & when theyre trying to find the joker they need to wait until he speaks another flaw that is pretty obvious is that a gunshot does nothing to the bat suit yeta dog can harm the wearer when the bombs are about to be activated the sailor only just finds out the thousands of gallons of flammable liquid in the engine room at that point i could go on and on about this but what really pisses me off is its place in the top 250so what everyone is saying is that its better than psycho better than the seven samurai better than alien better than seventh seal better than amadeus better than the matrix better than the terminator the list goes on so much that i could be here reviewing this film for days as far as acting goes heath ledger is the only performance that is descent christian bale as batman is hard to understand to me what i heard is ruta ruba runa roo this might sound weird when you say this review to yourself but say it in the batman voice & youll find similarities in both forms of dialogue hell this isnt even the best movie of 2008 iron man  the incredible hulk  let the right one in & hellboy 2 are the best because they hadyou knowthought put into it i realise this review might get slagged to death because i insulted everyones favourite movie apparrantly but in every decade there is an overrated director in the 70s it was copolla in the 80s its spieldberg in the 90s tarantino & in the 00s its nolan overall i think i have made an okay argument but i also expect fans to beat the living crap out of this review because its nolan & heath ledger died in shooting i can honestly say that not every movie that has had an actor died while shooting is a good movietake plan 9 from outer space bela lugossi died while making that & thats the same with this i am not comparing movies i would never do that heath ledger died but now they treat this movie & his performance like the second coming what happened to him was tragic but it doesnt mean that his performance is legendary the only time when a good movie has come off the death of an actor is the crow rating 1 10
