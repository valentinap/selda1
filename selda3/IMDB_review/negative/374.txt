i thought it was a complete waste of time to go to the cinema to watch this movie where to start? the plot is ridiculous the script is simple and not genuine the characters are weak and afflecks acting is terrible it seems like they try too hard to make the impression the story is complex but this worsens it even more in general this movie makes you feel nothingis not believable and i really dont know how can someone launch a movie like this and not feel any shame i respect this director very much but this work is not at all close to what he has done before i have to say it is one of the worst movies i have ever seen
