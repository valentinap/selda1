one big disappointment i kinda liked divergent but insurgent tries way to hard to be the next hunger games the movie doesnt have a good story line and the acting performances of all the young actors was very bad especially shailene woodleys performance was unbelievably bad this movie tries way to hard to be the next hunger games but it fails at each part bad storyline bad acting and an uninteresting story is why i see this film as a big disappointment if you liked the hunger games you better wait until the next hunger games arrives in november sorry divergent fans but insurgent isnt going to be the movie of the year
