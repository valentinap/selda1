i can not understand why anyone would enjoy this movie i actually got up and walked out halfway through there was so much gratuitous violence that i couldnt stand it splattering blood everywhere in order to explain myself there will be a few spoilers here but i will try and keep them to a minimum so if you want to be surprised dont read any further but i wouldnt be surprised if i were you we were and i am still angry about it i will say that several of the cast members were very good the premise of the movie is juvenile 5 minutes into the movie someone got split in half this gimmick was repeated later in the movie samuel jackson plays a black billionaire who dresses like flava flav and serves mcdonalds to who he thinks is a billionaire donor seriously? then there was the whole shoot the dog bit really how original but when everyone started killing each other in the church i was done if you are a thirteen year old boy with anger issues this movie is right up your alley i went on line to read what happens at end of the movie and was glad i made the decision to leave the movie how many times to you blow up a persons head and call it entertainment? it really bothers me that some people find this entertaining this was one step above a snuff film masquerading as a parodyhomage to james bond also am i the only one who got the subliminal message with the obama look alike who gets killed? seriously? there are not enough words to describe how bad this movie is if you enjoy blood and people getting killed rather graphically ad nausea then you will enjoy this movie if you want to see anything remotely resembling a decent movie you will not
