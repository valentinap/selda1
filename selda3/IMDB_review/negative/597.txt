i refuse to give away details of a film therefore this commentary is directed at people who have already seen the movie and may be a bit obscure to those who have not silly plot gratuitous violence way too long and very predictable if the mono frame shots of pitt and the identical baggage clues werent enough to explain exactly what was happening then hb carters reaction scene when norton asks her what she is doing there the morning after should have made it crystal clear for anyone over twelve i was shocked by how many previous comments referred to an unexpected twist at the end fight club is simultaneously homoerotic and homophobic i think the overwhelming popularity of this film among 1825 year old confused males unfortunately may be explained by the concept repeatedly expressed throughout the film that it is ok to bond with or even hug other men but only if you also hurt each other i can only recommend purchasing or renting this dvd to those readers who are both somewhat sadistic and not very bright
