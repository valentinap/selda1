maleficent attempts to tell an old story anew but all it does is completely redefine the title characters personality without taking the time to create a feasible explanation and alternative to the well known fairytale in disneys new maleficent we first see maleficent as a young girl with magnificent wings she is the largest fairy and protector of the magical moors from the greedy humans in another nearby kingdom she meets a human stefan who befriends her and she eventually falls in love with him only to be betrayed by his selfish and sinful humannature this is the new and unknown backstory that motivates the maleficent we know from the animated disney narrative children will enjoy this movie it is beautifully designed and full of wonderful scenery with magical creatures and talking trees disney plays into the innocence of children and fascination they have for nature and capitalize on it there is the darkness of a discernible villain and the light of a righteous hero adults and fans of the fairy tale will be disappointed the film is drawn out because no story progresses nor evolution occurs within maleficent the plot is flimsy weak and completely inconsistent with the narrative and poorly conceptualized nothing makes any sense and the title characters behavior is neither explained with a backstory nor revealed as a sad misunderstanding the writers try to make you believe that maleficent endured the ultimate betrayal and by her closest most trusted loved one there is absolutely no proof of this with the exception of a fabulously believable freak out by angelina jolie when she awakens to find herself mutilated no wonderful love story involving the future king stefan is shown and the first five minutes should only exist on the editing room floor there is a nice sentiment behind the makers intentions but the entire story is unrefined like a first draft director robert stromberg is new and it shows he lacks the confidence ability and experience to take the initiative and lead the story the writer linda woolverton is most at fault in her creation of a feeble unconvincing and baseless story executives should have used some of their $180million dollar budget on consulting with gregory maguire then there would be an intelligent logical but beautiful plot and woolverton could do what she does best create a screenplay to match now for the worst party of the film the fairy god mothers oh dear lord what have they done to the fairy godmothers? they are flighty imbecilic selfabsorbed twits since the story is so moronic the fairy involvement in raising aurora is explained with an impractical sentence as is most of the film then they spend the whole 16 years they are supposedly watching aurora by complaining about its inconvenience and arguing like the three stooges elle fanning is not the enchanting aurora and her aurora is annoyingly cloying they try to make it seem like this profound love exists for aurora from maleficent angelina jolie looks like maleficent she has the stature the prowess the harsh beauty and the outfit but little else sadly she never really acts and her accent is slacking she just stands and glares i never sense malice anger love betrayal or anything for that matter and certainly not ominous villainous evil i am supposed to believe she has a quiet strength from her power? no im guessing stromberg was taken by her beauty and celebrity and thought that sufficient with a flimsy story bad acting and a complete disregard for the storys structure the whole thing is preposterous is creating a harmonious rational account where a fairy turns evil really that difficult? or did executives hope that nobody would notice behind the cloak of the disneyjolie name i never felt anything watching this movie especially considering the immense power a disney movie can have nope no hope no love no care no warmth  i honestly never felt a single emotion for the whole shebang except for when the credits rolled find more reviews at our website
