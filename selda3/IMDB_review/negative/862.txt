i request to imdb please include 0 rating also atleast its soothing for people like us when they are able to express their opinion in the manner they want this movie does not deserve any rating at all if imdb group has something called best top negative comment for a particular movie then i request them to treat my comment as the top in that category that means i want my comment to be top from the bottom most of the time i watch movies only after checking the comments on the imdb website having seen such a good rating i rented this movie believe me not many times imdb comments proves so wrong this was the worst movie i have ever seen aaaaahhhhhh wait a minute i could not even see the whole movie all the time during the movie i was thinking that the good part is about to come but how was that possible good part would come only if there is any i am so surprised why so many people have reviewed this movie as one of the best movie they have ever seen total boring violent and logic less movie
