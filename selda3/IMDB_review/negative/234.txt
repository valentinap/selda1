oh my another science fiction film made by those geniuses who never took a science class in life interstellar is a boring slow plodding condescending type of film that thinks is much more smart than it realty is cantt just people go and explore three planets without this melodramatic nonsense? wouldnt it be much better if all this humanist approach was discarded in favor of a story based on the true adventure of traveling through a wormhole? if people want drama there are a huge number of other much better films if i want to feel bad i will watch schindlers list if i want some good science fiction i will watch aliens is it that hard for people to get it? this was supposed to be a science fiction adventure for gods sake why do these genius have to butcher what could have been a great film with all this overbloated sentimentalism this sacchariny mess? this is yet another proof that the masses are brain dead they laud anything that is over complicated with mindless twists with some sort of stupid revelation as the work of a genius interstellar is another extremely over rated film it rivals prometheus in stupidity id rather shoot a nail through my foot than ever watching it again
