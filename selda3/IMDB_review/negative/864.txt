ok i am not one of those people that hates films just because everyone else likes them i am not stupid i have two degrees a masters degree and a phd and i know a lot about films and agree with most of the top rated films on the imdb top films list however the thought of the godfather being called the greatest film of all time sickens me to believe that the only other film you must have watched must have been the people under the stairs the godfather is boring truly i love films but during this one i struggled to keep my eyes open i can take films at face value so i understand that maybe this film isnt supposed to be some fast paced shoot em up but it was so boring with so little character development and so little plot that i really didnt care what happened in this film ok so it is amazing how michael corleone takes over his dads role as head of the family why is it amazing who cares really there are so many other films with better character development i also hate the glorification of the mafias activities why should i be interested in how the son of a criminal and pimp takes over his fathers business and continues to terrorise and murder people if this film was about the the son of bin laden or one of the leaders of the bloods or the crips would people still be that interested i think that most of the people who like this film either like it because they feel they should or because they really cant justify their fascination with such a piece of crap and therefore revert to constructing deep and meaningful undertones to a film that clearly has none this film is a construct of the american fascination with the mafia and one of the longest on screen pieces of masturbation i have ever had the misfortune to witness if you like this film then fine but please like it for what it is a b rate gangster fantasy with no plot and very little character development
