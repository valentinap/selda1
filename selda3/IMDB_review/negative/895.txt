well i finally saw pulp fiction hadnt after all this time but ive heard so much ta doo over it so i rented it ugh i guess i must not be film critic material because i didnt appreciate the art of this film or its brilliance or any statement it might have made it was unpleasant filled with scumbag people i cared nothing about doing godawful things to each other with horrendously graphic visuals and appalling dialogue it jumped around in time circling back to where it opened but from another viewpoint and while that may be some sort of artsy crafting in editing or storytelling it doesnt save it from the fact that it was just plain revolting when the characters could get away for a second from m f ing all over the place there was some interesting verbal exchange bright and witty and even vaguely profound but kafka it aint i have to say i thought all the performances were incredible esp samuel jackson but cant quentin tarantino stay out of any of his own films even playing a nicer guy he comes off as a borderline psycho i thought it was very interesting tho to see chicago hopes eric stoltz in there as a drug dealer i worry about peoples minds if this is what they think of as a great movie eek a movie about redemption gee i didnt see any of that if perhaps a character got out of the violent melee alive id hardly call that redemption if they are hardly anyone worth caring about being redeemed in the first place an earthquake fault could have opened up and swallowed the lot of em and i would have applauded people think its really cool or trendy to give accolades to trash nowadays time to get some mouthwash for my eyes and get the stench out of em
