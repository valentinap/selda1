i looked forward to seeing this film so i was excited today i watched it it started badly i couldnt understand what the characters were mumbling later on i found this a god send it awful a real mess  badly made most of the time i had no idea what was going on too many characters introduced so quickly six different locations in ten minutes i hate itill never watch it again i only watched it to see if would improve but no it got worseif the comic was like this well its no wonder i have never heard of them beforethe tiny bits of humor are the only things that made em pay attention to anythingi wouldnt recommend this to anybody
