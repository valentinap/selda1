it is so disappointing to see a real classic destroyed by the same people that own the right to preserve it sleeping beauty 1959 stands among all disney films because of its great characters incredible art all the landscapes drawn by eyvind earle are legendary and because disney wisely used tchaikovskys ballet score well maleficent has no personality at all i must admit that jolie fits the role perfectly but sadly her character is so bad developed that it hurts king stefan is such an idiot with no depth at all and that also hurts because in the 1959 film he is a good king fanning does not give any charm to aurora the public does not fall in love with her regarding the art direction well at the beginning the film is a kind of dark crystaltinkerbell movie then it turns into lord of the rings it would have been great that this film would have an original art direction to honor the animated film the story is so rushed aurora sleeps like 15 minutes and the she wakes up to help maleficent kill his father and she gets real happy afterwards it is a shame really
