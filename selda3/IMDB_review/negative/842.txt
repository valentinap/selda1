i pretty much hated this movie its a prison movie so plot is basically tim robins gets framed than raped and eventually escapes morgan freeman is locked up and i dont know he just acts like a kid in this i understand hes suppose to be locked up since he was a teen but really hes giving the same performance here as his role as god in bruce almighty even though hes miscast he honestly carries the movie mainly because tim robins does nothing in this movie some other subplots include tim teaching some idiot to read or something some old guy hangs himself they deck a rooffreeman sneaks in a hammer and robins makes chess pieces ill stop the the point im making is this movie is excruciatingly boring number one on imdb are you kidding me even from a technical standpoint this movie blows everything is just dull and unimpressive hell it looks more like a tv movie than a film id describe the tone of this as disneys take on jail movies its to concerned with being safe and classy to accurately represent prison life everyones favorite part of this is the ending and that sucked too tim robins apparently escapes prison with a rock hammer after digging through his cell wall for like twenty years his hiding place is a poster really to make matters more hilarious he has crawls through a tunnel of poop and emerges from a poop lake in a failed attempt to move the audience morgan freeman gets paroled by basically insulting the judges than he goes to a rock in some random place that tim told him to visit and than goes to mexico and finds tim on a boat reunited and roll credits oh yeah morgan freeman also married his step granddaughter thats the dumbest ending ever written theres so much better stuff you could be watching instead of shawshank like porn or riki oh
