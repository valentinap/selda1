imdb 82 rating? seriously? this is basically the worst movie i ever seen i am still very sorry for my 3hourinlife has been wasted a week has been passed and i am still very sorry so i decided to write my very first review here to tell people how bad this movie is if i wanna watch a movie i wanna watch movie with plots with happenings with characters development but not a reallifelike  boring pointless film if i wanna watch a reallife something i rather watch a penguin grow old in 12 years with its family and i am sure it will be more interesting than watching boyhood the boy before aged 8 still adorable but once he is in high school he became a puppet with no facial expression and act like nothing worth him for a laugh this movie is long like i have been spending 12 years in the cinema its like forever i literally clapped when its end as i am too excited and over the moon that the movie is finally over boyhood definitely deserved a best picture best picture to sleep on best picture that deserved the worst picture ever best picture to make you feel regret for your 3hoursin life best picture to exchange puzzled eyes with your friends during the whole movie
