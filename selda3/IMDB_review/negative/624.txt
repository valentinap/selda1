spoiler this is one of a few movies overrated by wannabe intellectuals the script is slick in that it disguises its propaganda propaganda you ask lets start off with the fact that edward nortons character in this movie is psychotic and brad pitts doesnt exist brad pitts character tyler durden is a figment of nortons imagination because nortons character is psychotic this whole plot twist becomes even more aggravating when you realized you wasted over two hours watching a movie about a psychotic anarchist the movies message is great for impressionable kids
