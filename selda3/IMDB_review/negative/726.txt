 all of the lord of the rings movie are overrated but thats just my opinion they are not good enough to even be on the top 250 how could this be number 3 or did u just say hmm this movie won an academy award umm it must be good its not all it was was action and boringness now i dont necessarily hate these movies but definantly overrated i mean not even being worthy of an academy award or being on the top 250 i mean come on people ive seen people with good movie taste say these were good in my opinion the 2nd one was the best and the others were hardly okay for me and i did not like the 3rd and was very angry wen i saw it under godfather and the shawshank redemption i mean jeez now this is only my opinion but i know several people who agree with me now this is just my opinion so dont get all offended
