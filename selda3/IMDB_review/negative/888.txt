 as a 13 year old just getting into cinema this was the best film ever how could i not be blown away by all the clever dialog great characters fantastic storyline and gripping violence it was just pure heaven i saw this movie three times in the course of one year and i still have such fond memories of watching it it was around the time i got serious about cinema about two years later that i felt i needed to give this another go id discovered the works of bergman tarkovsky godardetc and felt a connection with film in ways i hadnt before and i wanted to see if the movies i loved before still held up i had every intention of loving pulp fiction just as much as i did back then but i didnt there was nothing there no core all the things id loved about it were gone that clever dialog referential nonsense that gave no insight into who i was watching or attempted to expand the narrative the great characters indistinctive cardboard cutouts that act as mouthpieces for tarintino fantastic storyline a pseudo throwback to film noir that cant decide whether it wants to take itself seriously or be intentionally stupid for the sake of irony gripping violence its violence thats harsh enough to put the average viewer in awe safe enough as to not offend its a dead film with no ideas a common argument i hear in its favor is that its somehow objectively entertaining why because it has guys with guns and monologues about mcdonalds sorry but thats not entertainment in my mind entertainment is being engaged having to think a film like andrei rublev is entertaining because while i watch it it evokes thought and feeling it has something i can sink my teeth into i can still think about it interpret it in different ways pulp fiction is just shutting your brain off for two and half hours while a man with a god complex strokes his ego basically i can understand to some extent why it is so popular its very good at pleasing the masses something tarkovsky could never do its so perfectly designed to hook the average viewer in but its paper thin this is exactly what i dont want in cinema
