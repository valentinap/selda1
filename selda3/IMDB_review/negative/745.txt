i have now put myself through the sometimes enjoyable but mostly painful experience of watching these three movies i have to say i do think the 3rd one was the best but lets be honest it didnt have much competition one thing is for sure this film and the trilogy as a whole is easily the most overrated event in history many films should be above this effort in the top250 the problems the plot for starters not only did it not make any sense it was basically after 9 hours about destroying a ring and fighting a couple of battles all the meaningless subplots and political gesturing really didnt add to the film the characters werent fleshed out at all even after 9 hours could you really mention much about any of the many characters as a result most of the time i couldnt care less about who was doing what and why for a film to be a classic surely it must have some surprises or must be original in some way and perhaps more importantly stir the juices of our soul all we had were some very good special fx and some nice new zealand scenery the filming was very much join the dots stuff nothing novel or clever it the way it was shown to the viewer do we really need to here the word `precious again and again do we really need to see yet another slow motion close up of frodos face all of this made the film and films over long and lacking in any substance
