i saw the trailer expecting this to be an extraordinary movie angelina jolies looks is perfect for the part the effects promised to be nothing short of awesome and the glimpse at the dragon woke up delightful memories of fear from the day i saw the original cartoon movie with my mom a long time ago i bought the tickets to see it in 3d with my daughters and i could anticipate the atmosphere of malevolence from the dark maleficent then it all changed in the name of doing something different and to surprise the audience the screenplay writers threw a wonderfully balanced story out the window and decided to make a nonsensical parody instead who do they think they are? to second guess writers that have thrilled whole generations of people and produce this garbage in the name of the box office? not only did they alter the essence of the story but they made a total confusion out of the message of good versus evil what? bad is good and good is bad? or is it good sometimes and bad in others? what will the kids think? do the screenplay writers really expect that the kids will readily understand how despair and betrayal can turn someone into a vengeful person? does it even have a place in this story? of course not kids may need to be taught reality in real life but when they are told a story taking place in an imaginary world they expect something straightforward so that a message stands clearly out the only good thing that can come out of this is that someone somewhere makes a remix of this movie the way it should be done filling the blanks with the original cartoon masterpiece shame on you disney studios watch snow white and the hunter and learn how a classic story should be told and especially how far it can be altered without losing its essence
