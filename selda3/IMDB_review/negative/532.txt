although there was an impossible mission in this movie the story has nothing whatsoever to do with the classic tv series in the show a team of under cover specialists created an artificial situation for the benefit of the victims of a sting type operation usually resulting with their enemies turning on each other the imf team in this movie pretty much refers to tom cruise alone with the rest of the team reduced in status to nameless flunkies who just stand around and watch as he single handedly saves the world the tv shows covert stealth premise was tossed out since cruise doesnt emote well enough to convey the tension of committing espionage right under a dangerous enemys nose instead the original format was replaced by cranked up action at an impossible james bond on steroids level with scenes such as the exciting but ridiculously over the top helicoptertrain sequence other actors have woefully limited screen time but act their parts faithfully the original score from the show is utilized well spicing up the action effectively the script is shallow and the entire mole twist bit is concealed as well as is as an elephant hiding behind an ant its also an insanely stupid plot twist which spits on the tv series the impossible mission to make tom an action hero see a james bond flick or a rerun of the original tv series instead
