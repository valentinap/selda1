well this movie is not for people who like subtlety not for people who like good dialogues not for people who like interesting characters it is for people who love action action and nothing much else for people who love pompous battles on big screens hollow words rhetorics of of the kind great dictators are so fond of big words like today mankind will not fail sure i can see why people like this movie they are just easily pleased they see a big battle scene and theyre happy they see orcs orcs and still more orcs and they think wow these orcs must be metaphors for all the bad bad people that are out there on this evil evil planet how deep what geniuses are tolkien and peter jackson they see a helicopter view of a battlefield great graphics of a fictional city a realistic monster spider and theyre happy they see good triumph over evil and they think thats the way it should be because well uhm because its different from real life i guess it gives them uhm hope it must be nice to not see that cheap emotions the flat characters some of the most stereotyped dialogues ever written in the history of film it must be great to be able to love this movie
