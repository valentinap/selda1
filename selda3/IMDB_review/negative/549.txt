preface i really think i was careful enough with my words to avoid any spoiling but if vague descriptions count as spoilers to you dont read on lets face it  its all about fighting  gruesome stupid uncivilized uncultured immature fighting if you are a caveman go ahead and like this movie if not then i am sincerely grateful for your existence in our world on a side note despite the plot holes i figured out who pitts character was since the endoftheapartment scene id be interested to know if anyone else was able to predict the same thing the very end of the movie falls under the same category as the body  immature shallow and useless i just gotta say it  this is my least favorite movie of all time
