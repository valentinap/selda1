i was really excited from seeing the review score on here and all the hype i had heard from other people via social media i eagerly pressed play the initial opening scene was quite intense and moving and i was quite taken aback by how that went i wondered if this level of intensity would set the bar for character development throughout the film and i was immediately grasped my illusions were soon dashed as the film fast forwards to when the boy is grown up and is stealing an item he is most definitely not grown up and a complete idiot i guess this bit is meant to appeal to 6 yr olds? it is almost as bad as trump jokes i cringed i let it slide and hoped for better it got exciting when the chase scene was happening then they went to prison then they broke out and then they tried to sell the item that pretty much summarises the whole film the main protagonist is a buffoon who swears a few times for good measure kids watch this film the only character that seemed to develop was draxx as he reflects on his poor choices the bad guy isnt even scary  he doesnt do that much compare the bad guy to loki and the difference is infinite no character development apart from a 1 minute scene with draxx the annoying rocket character that had zero impact a non entity villain a weak weak weak plot line and the dialogue was so flimsy in fact most of the characters flip flopped around in reasons to do things that didnt really make logical sense the only saving graces were the planet scenery and make up i hesitate to say the cinematography as it was cgi the worst bit out of many was where the racoon decided he wanted a mans prosthetic limb to escape the prison and then sniggered about how he wanted to see the guy hop about  i actually found this really offensive and dont want my children to think that is a funny and b ok the best bit was the soundtrack overall a very disappointing disjointed film it felt as jarring as star trek into darkness coupled with star wars jar jar binks and a smidge of the goonies but nowhere near as good
