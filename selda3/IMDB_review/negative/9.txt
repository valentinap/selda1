where to start this isnt anything to do with sleeping beauty apart from the names even then the three good fairies names change who are knotgrass thistlewit and flittle? shouldnt it be flora fauna and merryweather whats the point in changing the names it adds to the complete difference between sleeping beauty and maleficent since when did maleficent see aurora everyday in sleeping beauty she sends her warthog things to find aurora but they have been looking in cradles for 16 years so she sends her ravencrow to find aurora however in maleficent they become really good friends and maleficent wants aurora to stay with her what?? some if this is from the book i read so im blaming the book as well here since when did the queen die? at the end of sleeping beauty it pictures her with stefan while phillip and aurora dance happy ending in maleficent auroras parents both die wow and its not like disney to suffocate someone as in stefan and king henry and making the ravencrow be the dragon totally takes it away from maleficent that was a main part in the story in sleeping beauty but now its a meh moment seriously quit while your ahead frozen was amazing so disney should have waited a but to find new ideas not just launch into another movie which a lot of people seem to dislike for the same reasons thus film takes it away from frozen i could honestly go on but it would take all day to point out the flaws in the book and the film the storyline is what makes a storyfilm yeah characters are important but if the story is untrue and totally contradicts itself how can the actors look good films have to make actors look good maleficent doesnt im usually a massive fan of disney but whoever wrote this needs to watch sleeping beauty again
