 well the lord of the rings trilogy seems to be a cheap action movie which hasnt much common with the great book from tolkin the return of the king has some nice battle scenes but its just another action movie with mostly good special effects many good parts of the original book where totally twisted mixed or deleted with not much sense and some very stupid parts are just invented from peter jackson to show more of this not so impressive orlando blum its good that tolkin cant see this movie i just hope it makes him not spinning in his grave my hint to peter jackson stay at your roots and make more splatter movies like braindead
