not only did everything happen way too fast it didnt make much sense either as it was told to us near the end he was the more or less same person as before death doing everything not because of his own desire but because of the women he lovesd what she wanted was explained and he did exactly that being able to heal the planet being able to cure diseases and injuries enhance and watch over literally everything just why in the name of pickles did he decided to throw everything away? his processing capabilities were supposed to be beyond comprehension and the best thing he could come up with was basically sending the world back to the stone age? and people were actually lining up behind this idea? lets see no communication no worth of money no medication no order no disaster recovery its the end of economy so what comes are spreading sicknesses starvation maybe a few wars here and there just to spice it up a little its pure chaos and anarchy nothing more so against the wishes heal the planet to help people of the most important person to him against his owndesire to keep her alive he was like ah screw it that the blondie wouldve shot the other guy my apologies im not good with names is yet again irrelevant with the power at his fingertips he wouldve been able to recover him as well but killing off his love himself and probably billions more is sure a better idea and please dont try the people fear what they dont know or they were scared it would take over the world bull**** because with just an ounce of intelligence theyd have realized that the upcoming suffering and deaths of this new dark age and more suffering and deaths in this still imperfect world is no better option than the worst case scenario the hive mind and loss of individuality order prosperity and evolution again that was the worst case scenario which was not at all the case personally i find it difficult to understand his everything but logical decisions to put it lightly for me this movie was simply horrible an awful experience ps i do not exactly care about the actors the acting the serenity the animations or anything elseat all i am talking about the story the plot nothing else
