the buildup to a change from a licentious rich kid to a heroic vigilante was very poorly written the character is not believable in the least a guy spends 5 years on a deserted island struggling for survival yet finds enough time and resources to learn martial arts a foreign language and acrobatics? come on not to mention that he somehow managed to manufacture electronically enhanced arrows and become a hacker you call that believable? really? besides he wants to be a good guy and save the city so he starts by physically attacking his bodyguard and killing people whos only visible crime is working for a mobster some good values there no doubt the other characters are not much better each of them is a stereotype of some kind not a rounded complicated human being in almost every single respect the first episode was one of the worst tv shows ive ever seen i will not watch the second episode honestly i wish i could unwatch the first one
