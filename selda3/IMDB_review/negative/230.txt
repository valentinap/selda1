ok so i will start out by saying that i am a huge fan of the books and the series i love it this movie just made me extremely angry i burst out the theater exclaiming they ruined it they ruined it and i ranted on about it for about an hour or so after btw this is my strong personal opinion heres why i hate it so severely 1 it was extremely unfaithful to the book 2 they took out 90% of the books story and replaced it with an awful replacement book by far wins 3 this movie was dark and disturbing a lot of killing and pain and blood and several scenes were otherwise classified as dark my opinion 4 the box does not exist in the book the simulations to open this box do not exist in the book and i hated seeing jeanine torture the divergents 5 tris hates herself and thinks about killing herself i dont think thats a good message shes sending out for a main character to hate herself and think about killing herself may appear that its ok for people out there to feel and do the same and its not 6 the script was poorly written nothing else needed to add 7 the plot was extremely predictable i understand that a ton happens in the book but this way it isnt predictable and i get excited to turn each page in the movie you know what will happen oh this is a simulation even though they pretend it isnt oh they pushed her weak point of course she will do what they want her to do oh she did that yup i knew he would come oh i knew everyone would join yup i knew they would overpower him that sort of junk so there you go i dont want to come off like a hater but i thought it should be known especially with this movie that you should save your money and go buy some ice cream hope i helped a bit and didnt spoil to much =
