this movie was terrible long and boring both my wife and i hated it i love star wars the old ones i am told i am just not a fantasy fan but i think i am just not a fan of badly done commercialized fantasy if i want to see a documentary on new zeland landscape i will rent it the movie should tell a compelling story with 20 characters and none of them even close to well developed i had no attachment to any of them yes i did not read the books i actually read the hobbit as a kid and loved it and remember it well i think they were just too true to the books and didnt realize that the books dont make a good movie unless you have read and loved the books call me the grinch i am not harsh on most movies all my friends love this movie and are avid fans i have no idea how it is anywhere in the top 250 maybe i could say this is a decent flick if you have nothing mildly stimulating to watch some weekend or need a decent rental my wife walked out of this movie i bared through it in the theaters just to give it a chance i would never rent it dont bother dragonslayer from back in the day does it much better and with triple the drama and action
