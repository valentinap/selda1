as almost an oldtimer having enjoyed the original tv series i rushed to the theater to remember some of the old feeling flawed casting an unbalanced script hesitating acting and overthetop special effects made me grind my teeth in anger and close my eyes tight shut in shame the plot the effects the relations the triple treason etc all have a distinct smell of the improbable it has several moments you feel like saying yeah right to the screen to indicate what you see is truly and utterly impossible and as always that kills the movie and thats sad
