well well well thanks a lot for spoiling 150 minutes of my life i still dont understand why this film is so highly rated i guess i should not believe in ratings of imdb anymore  please dont watch this trash its such a waste of time a girl  to avenge the betrayal gets hold of her husband by planting a successful crime scene that can happen only in movies and that girl ends up patching up with him again if this all had to happen then what was the fun of making that dirt of 150 mints so awful ending those who rated it 10 must be banned for further rating the most disgusting movie i have seen in my life and yes what happened to police in the end  they knew she was criminal but they couldnt do anything wow u think we are buffoons  get a life mr director and please dont breed regards
