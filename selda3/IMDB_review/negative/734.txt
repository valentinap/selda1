 i watched the fellowship & could live with the changes the two towers made my heart sink too many alterations & additions yes additions i can understand cutting the story to fit but shovelling lumps of extraneous storyline in that is not in the book why extra elves at helms deep wtf why cut bits that those familiar with the books are expecting to add garbage that no one expects i cant explain the return of the king was for me the last straw the return of jacksons ego more like why they saw fit to change dialogue from the original in some cases only a few words & in others changing the speaker of the words this is peter jacksons lotr not tolkeins i havent checked but the credits should show inspired by jrr tolkein because this is not his work i will stick with the bbc 4 version which while abridged is true to tolkein & the pictures are better on radio
