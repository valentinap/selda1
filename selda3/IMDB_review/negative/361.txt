i was anticipating this movie as i was an ardent fan of the original series and the remakes in the 80s what a major disappointment this was the film begins ok but then it all falls apart and becomes just another run of the mill action movie using the same format that hollywood churns out so often cruse is totally misscast and unconvincingthe point of the series was its cleverness and the fact that you could not work out how they would do things this was just the biggest disappointment on film i have seen apart from the even worse 2 follow ups i am sure many younger movie goers would like this film simply as an action film but mission impossible it is not and jim phelps turning traitor? please
