i cant tell you how disappointed i am in the dark knight my friends and i waited for months to see this and it was a film i was expecting to see numerous times having viewed it i wouldnt watch it again unless someone paid me a lot of money im a science fiction fan so i on board with artistic allowance as long as its consistent with the framework of the film there were several violations in this movie that i dont understand how people fans can get past ill site a few examples that i feel cheapened the movie beyond repair 1right out of the gate in the opening scene since when can batman bend a steel gun barrel with his hands 2bruce wayne is now smart enough to network all the phones in gotham city and stick the results into a database last time i checked my phone didnt have sonar technology the phone that morgan freeman brought to hong kong was described to have special capabilities yet suddenly bruce wayne is able to extend that capability to all 30m citizens phones in the city the most idiotic part was when mogran freeman was analyzing the output and suddenly the jokers face appeared on the screen immediately in front of him did the joker stop by at&t before that scene to upgrade his phone there were about 500 mini screens in front of moran freeman and he just so happened to be looking at the one where the jokers face appeared i wanted to leave the theater at this point 3 if you are admitted to the hospital with burns on half your body and your clothes are saturated from lying on a floor with gasoline the hospital will remove and dispose of your clothes when you are admitted yet when the joker freed two face two face suddenly had his half burned clothes back on for the remainder of the movie 4who planted all the explosive charges in the hospital for the joker there seemed to be hundreds of devices that were suddenly in place and conveniently no hospital staff noticed oh and how convenient that the joker had a friend or a bomb in the right place at the right time whenever he was in a bad position something like this is okay in couple occasions in the movie but not in every scene 5what was the point in having the lamborghini in the movie just to be destroyed cheap thrill ledgers direct performance was great i just wish they had built a simpler more believable movie around him i wanted this movie to be great as much as anyone here i expect a certain level of consistency and believability from the movies i watch again believable within the framework of the movie as much as i wanted tdk to be a great movie i couldnt even will this movie to the level of awful
