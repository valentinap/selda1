i honestly dont know what to say this has got to be the worst movie ive ever had the misfortune to watch and yet its getting such good reviews why anyone would give it a rating above 5 is a mystery to me is almost everyone on imdb just wannabe critics or is there actually something that i just missed while watching this i found it a challenge just to get through the movie never mind enjoy it my advice to anyone thinking of watching this dont it will only disappoint you there is no real plot or storyline and the movie is very disengaging characters and events are boring to follow and personally i feel that there are plenty more movies more deserving of the credit this movie is given
