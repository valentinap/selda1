i decided to give this film a go out of a love for classic disney pre digital angelina jolies striking image and the fantasy element sadly angelina jolies image is the only successful aspect of this film what a surprise that is the only image associated with the film elle fanning is in the kindest terms distinctly average and certainly not blessed with grace or a beauty by any great stretch of the imagination neither can she act sharlto copley is also incredibly overrated and should only be considered for minor supporting roles there is no character development copleys character is shown as a love interest then we are told not shown that he is ambitious next thing he is evil and cuts off maleficents wings and becomes inherently bad  this makes no sense when maleficent finds her wings stolen we see her mourn for them for a few seconds at most next thing she is evil while the cgi is good the fairy fantasy element is shallow  remember how rich with emotion action humour and charm the animal scenes were in snow white and the seven dwarfs? i expected a certain amount of darkness and menace something to give us an emotional journey  this was completely lacking all in all a wasted opportunity of a film it would be forgettable if it didnt infuriate me so much
