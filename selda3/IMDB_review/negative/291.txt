its disgusting tom cruise turned a clever fun ensemble show into yet another big effect vehicle for his mammoth ego i could hardly believe my eyes when in the first few minutes cruise his movie i hold him responsible kills off his entire team which consists by and large of far more talented actors just so he can do his lone wolf vengeance thing this time its personal in those few minutes he destroyed any relationship the movie had to the show its a disgrace ive never liked tom cruise but his astonishingly arrogant appropriation and destruction of the missionimpossible theme is a new low aside from this the movie itself is utterly formulaic uniting the implausible with the predictable jean reno is good in anything but no one can save this
