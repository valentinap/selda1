the movie versions of mission impossible are complete crap that are nothing like the tv series the movie versions of mission impossible turned the tv shows hero jim phelps into a bad guy and made a character ethan hunt who wasnt even in the tv series into the hero of the movies it would be like making a movie adaptation of the ateam with colonel hannibal smith turning into a bad guy killing the rest of the team and then having a totally new character not in the tv series be the hero of the movie moreover the movie versions of mission impossible are just another action movie with fancy stunts and bigbudget explosions like the james bond movies the tv series wasnt about stunts and explosions the tv series was about cleverlydevised cloakanddagger plots to trick the bad guys into turning against each other the tv series was about outsmarting the bad guys with brains not beating the bad guys with brawn in fact there were probably less punches thrown during the entire two tv series than during the mission impossible movie the producers of the mission impossible movie just wanted a way to market tom cruise in an action movie with fancy gadgets and bigbudget explosions but there are so many of these similar movies that have already been made so they called it mission impossible to lure in fans of the old tv series if youre just looking for a bigbudget remake of a rambotype movie then go ahead and see this movie but if youre a fan of the mission impossible tv series then dont waste your time on this crap of a movie
