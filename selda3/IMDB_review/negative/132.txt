the story was initially promising but after mission start of the film had unfortunately many lengths it would have been better to put this place 2h 3h the whole film has somehow worked very pieced together  the scifi ideas were sometimes quite ok but not consistent in star trek z b the makers have previously carefully considered to create a coherent picture to in this film here it creates the rocket spaceship with his ridiculous drive to escape the pull of the black hole  the special effects were on the level of 90 years  since ive been hoping for much more i went because of the extremely good reviews on imdb in this film and am just disappointed
