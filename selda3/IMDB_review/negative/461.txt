hated it most boring film of the year couldve followed someone a bit interesting for ten years rather than this boring tripe sit around the kitchen table go to school kitchen table school father in law gets drunk school table etc etc you get the idea thats it in a nutshell sorry for all the spoilers but turkey of the year for me do not understand how so many people like it probably many boring people relate to it hope it doesnt win any oscars there are many other films more worthy just because this is a unique film doesnt make it a good one acting is terrible and there is no plot obviously its just a 3 hour documentary following a family who get divorced but are still friends but im struggling to see the story here surely if you are going to do something as clever as is at least make it worthwhile most kids growing up have a trip to hospital it an accident this kid doesnt nowt didnt even have a personality
