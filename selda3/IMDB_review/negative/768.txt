 if this movie did not have based on book by jrr tolkien it would have canned like waterworld and other big budget disasters having based on book by jrr tolkien does not guarantee success even if the scriptwriters followed the book word for word and yet peter jackson and fran walsh et al took it upon themselves to re write the lotr book and change the characters almost diametrically opposite to what they were written and it didnt work at all a director producer is entitled to modify the book to make it accessible on screen hardly one change from the script team worked at all in this case gandalf took the brunt of the bastardisation in rotk after aragorn got butchered in the ttt if not in fotr in fotr peter jackson was lucky in making a clone of the bakshi cartoon and it turned out fine with the new additions on the dvd once the cartoon ended in ttt however jackson just ran out of ideas and inspiration rotk is brash and loud and big and comedic production but the substance isnt there despite drawing from the book of the century some dialogue were puzzling go home sam was there a taxi available nearby others were just bad a diversion thanks legolas there was a lack of suspense and a total lack of sacrifice both sides seemed evenly matched camaraderie nobility the forced emotions and acting and soft lighting only go to reveal how clich‹©d this anti hollywood movie really is is it then any wonder that christopher lee wanted off this badly conceived and edited project enjoy it as a fantasy film and an inside joke from the scripting team that no one really gets and nothing more despite 11 oscars thanks for the effort peter but please have the self respect to refuse sympathy oscars or if you really want to kill 3 hours with the kids people just want to believe so desperately that the tolkien movies are as good as the books when the hype will have died down the merits of these films will be judged accordingly the fact that chris tolkien son of the author remains silent on the trilogy speaks volumes on the quality of the trilogy as an extension of his fathers writing
