and i dont think its me if you want to know specifically whats wrong with this flick look at some of the other 1* reviews its been spelled out in detail what i want to talk about is how this dumb movie has an 8* rating with over 200k people rating it the first thing that comes to mind is what i read about another new release the interview which had a high rating and lots of positive reviews within 24 hours of its release someone pointed out the statistical aberrations of those numbers suggesting imdb was getting bombarded by false accounts with an addenda to deceive for this movie i dont think thats the case so im wondering how so many people can be so uncritical in their thinking well about half the voters in the usa voted to reelect george w bush so that explains a lot for those of you who gave this movie high marks and didnt vote for bushs second term please consider this for the future there are movies where we are presented with a madeup reality from the start like time travel for example or unreal mental states like in tron or the matrix with those you say ok its bs now entertain me but when a movie takes place in the world we know and live in there is a higher standard as the story progresses it must be logical it cant defy gravity it cant do things that are not gunna happen in real life those are the holes in the story in gone girl there are so many holes and those holes are so ridiculous you gotta ask yourself do they think im stupid? i guess the answer is yes i guess they are correct i guess im now a minority the dumbing of america is happening
