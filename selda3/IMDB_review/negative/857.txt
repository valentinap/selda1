 i finally saw this movie because everyone kept talking about it but for anyone who has seen more than a few movies ie somebody over 20 there is just nothing there even without the hype i found this movie to be really painfully bad a few points  it seems the movie is trying to be realistic starting with something that looks like a somewhat believable heist but then there are so many totally improbable things like batmans hideout and gadgets the joker somehow getting zillions of minions etc so which is it a gritty crime movie or fantasy i cant tell  havent we seen witty dialog like this 100 times batman let her go joker oh very poor choice of words drops her out window when this happened my jaw dropped this is worse than a rambo movie  i get it that heath ledger playing the joker is supposed to be some crazy psycho hardly original or award worthy just looked like a hundred others we have seen before in other movies  all characters are totally off the shelf theres no depth or surprise to them at all  what does rachel dawes see in bruce wayne in the scene in the restaurant i own the place he seems like a braggart and feels the need to arrive at his own party in a helicopter with three arm candy women on his arm why isnt he already at his own place  oh look a fancy party in waynes penthouse i wonder whats going to happen look the bad guy comes in a starts tormenting people then wayne has to change into his batman costume to save the day how is this not 110% predictable  again is the movie supposed to be realist when arrested the joker would really be forced to wash the makeup off his face  bruce wayne saves the armored truck from a collision by placing his lamborghini in between it an on coming truck arent armored trucks stronger than sports cars yeah i know wayne has some magic tech so at this point we are supposed to suspend disbelief  i could go on obviously some people really like this movie thats great but please dont say its anything like the best movie ever until you have seen some films from the afis lists http wwwaficom 10top10
