amazing special effects have been used to mask peter jacksons mangling of the original plotline and script warning this film is a prime example of a brilliant book being americanised ie hammered into the boy meets girl girl loses boy boy and girl reunite format it has a couple of elvish words thrown in to preserve an illusion of adhering to the original book but with aragorns american accent often intruding this performance is hardly spell binding
