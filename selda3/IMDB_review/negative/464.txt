guardians of the galaxy is just another mediocre film under the pretence of future it sneaked in embraces of the past perhaps it tried to be both but it was neither a serious film nor a comedy it failed to trigger any deeper emotion inside me its humour was out of context there were too many characters most of which were not properly developed the purposes of existence of those figures were very confusing ill comment in detail on the triggering of deeper emotions and the humour in the following 2 paragraphs someone commented that the films like the dark knights series set a standard that superhero films must be deep and thoughtful that person further commented that this film guardians of the galaxy challenged this standard i generally dont like dogmas but here its not at all about dogmas it is just the fact that those deep ones could trigger deeper emotions or provoke thoughts or inspire the audiences or help the audiences learn something or help the audiences learn themselves better by these the audiences like think about involuntarily recall remember and give high scores for those deep films of course different people have different opinions on deepness so i dont comment on the deepness of guardians of the galaxy just commenting on triggering deeper emotions or provoking thoughts or inspiring me or helping me learn something or learn myself better unfortunately guardians of the galaxy did none of these to me so it just didnt make me feel that way that it was one of those alltime great films someone commented that guardians of the galaxy was not a serious film but rather it was a great lighthearted comedy even for this i dont think i could agree great humour exists in context in the right context something plain could be hilarious out of context brilliant jokes were just nothing in guardians of the galaxy too much humour ran out of context for example the raccoon said later that he asked for one prisoners prosthetic leg was just a joke what did this convey? it was clever to play such heartless jokes on your partners when it was time to be serious? no how about it tried to portray a figure the raccoon who was unfazed in front of great danger? but then you had to make the situation look dangerous even in the wizard of oz 1939 the scenes felt more creepy than here in the prison the prison here felt just like a noisy secondhand market so i didnt find the joke funny and didnt know why it was in the film otherwise either there were many such lines i knew they were intended to be something to make people laugh but i just didnt feel that entertained at those improper moments all in all guardians of the galaxy has no place on the alltime great list perhaps it was the last joke it could play on itself being put into the top 250 list among those great films its mediocrity would just manifest itself just within the first month of its release it dropped 20 places on the top 250 list from the 34th to the 54th as time goes on this film will likely drop further when the enthusiasm fades after its initial surge there are great films like in the name of the father 1993 a beautiful mind 2001 etc they were not on the top 250 list before but gradually rose up and emerged into the alltime great list just on the contrary guardians of the galaxy will gradually drop out of the top 250 list
