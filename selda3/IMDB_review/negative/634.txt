this film starts off well and keeps you interested until about half way through in the second half of the film the storyline goes all over the place and when you realise whats actually going on then you realise how ridiculous it all is as a result the film loses all credibility and youre just left feeling cheated whereas with other promising bad films the problem is usually that the basic idea for the plot is good and they are simply badly executed like the sixth sense  here the main idea is absurd and is also executed badly the only good things in this film are the acting and the camerawork which is admittedly good but for a good film you need a good plot not a ridiculous one all in all very bad not worth watching and certainly doesnt deserve to be anywhere in the list of best 250 films avoid at all cost will leave you feeling disillusioned
