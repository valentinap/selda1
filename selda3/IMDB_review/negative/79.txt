this movie is an absolute waist of time so pathetic pretentious wannabe philosophic nolans puke with terrible acting nothing more than that are people becoming this dumb to find this movie actually good? i could not find anything in it that would touch me move me it was just so empty without any wow moment except maybe the water part what was the point of this movie? i feel it has none  maybe just to make money as that is the point of life we live for these days love as a premise is ok but it just got waisted in this one sorry to all who liked it but something is going so wrong in hollywood i feel so embarrassed for the movie industry
