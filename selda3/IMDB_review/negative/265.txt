like many others i was disappointed with the fact that for the big screen almost all the elements which made the tv series mission impossible so entertaining  the team ethos the complex contricks etc  were jettisoned in favour of a huge ego boost for the one man show that is mr tom cruise it is particularly annoying given that the plot chosen to replace it is so bogstandard and predictable an honest hero is framed for something he didnt do and spends the rest of the movie trying to clear his name and out the real spy this seems to be the plot of every third blockbuster these days  two titles released just before mi using exactly the same storyline spring to mind judge dredd and schwarzeneggers eraser it was also totally unnecessary to take the hero of the original series and make him the villain of the movie  can you imagine a film version of the untouchables with the cops hot on the trail of the evil gang boss eliot ness? there is also the fact that the movie is deeply insecure one feels that it would like to be a coldwar style espionage picture but does not have the courage of its convictions so tacks a cheesy and implausible action sequence onto the end i could go on but at the end of the day my list of criticisms are all are all pretty subjective and dont really point to this being a bad film simply one that i dont like but then suddenly it struck me the reason i find this movie so intensely pointless and the reason i think its no good is that so many scenes are so stupid or just completely extraneous take for example the films most memorable moment  the break in to the cia building to steal half of the noc list we are told that this is the most secure room in the entire world that it has every security system known to man except it seems a plain and simple good old cctv camera sure the scene is well directed and a fair amount of tension is wrung from it but if you take a step back to think its preposterous besides by my reckoning there is no reason for hunt even to have the real noc list if he is planning on double bluffing simply to smoke out the spy so the scene shouldnt even be there why would he endanger all those agents by handing over the real list? nit picking? certainly but it sums up for me why the whole thing is a waste of time there are plenty of movies one can enjoy by checking ones brain in at the theatre door but when a movie cloaks itself in a supposedly complex plot and encourages the audience member to engage his or her brain and then doesnt even stand up to scrutiny i find the whole process deeply depressing  more so when the film takes itself as seriously as this one evidently does i cant even be entertained anymore because i am acutely aware of how shallow empty and ultimately pretentious it all is so sorry folks but if you ask me this is a red herring wrapped up in a macguffin wrapped up in a shaggy dog story with fleas all designed for the sole purpose of making tommy look good its a real shame that the supporting cast production values direction etc are all so high since the film itself is so thoroughly worthless at my most generous id give it 410
