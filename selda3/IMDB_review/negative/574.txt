first off im not going to say this film was terrible and anyone who disagrees with me is an idiot we all have our own idiosyncrasies that colour how we view art and i respect others views enough to know that nothing is categorical terrible or brilliant for every member of the audience but for mei think fight club had something to say but to me it didnt seem very original or subtle among other themes in other films ive seen the two identities thing done much better in david lynchs lost highway and feel american psycho did the male alienation in corporate america thing in a subtler and funnier way fight club seemed so straightforward and obvious that i felt like the director was dumbing it down for me almost insulting my intelligencei dont know maybe its just my taste im glad so many people did get so much out of it though that is one of the most important criteria for a film to have to be considered great so i guess this is a great film
