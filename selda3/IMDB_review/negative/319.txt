im not a fan of comic book heroes and wasnt even familiar with the character before i noticed the pilot listed on tv im down to only two hours of television per week i cant handle any more than that and thought it might be nice to see something new and it would be nice  if there ever was anything new i made myself sit through the whole pilot which by todays standards equals about 40 minutes of programming and 20 minutes of commercials long before it was over i found myself asking a familiar question does it cost less to produce crap than it does to produce quality remember when the commercials during the superbowl were all funny? maybe some of you arent that old but believe me its true they used to be funny why arent all commercials funny? does it cost less to produce stupid commercials? i wonder tv shows used to be creative technical artistic and dramatic a few of them still are ok maybe two of them still are the rest are crap does it cost less to produce crap? i have to admit that my expectations of any new show arent very high but arrow like so many other shows today fall so far short its laughable lets not talk about the oh come on situations like how does a guy come back from a 5 year absence to a lair set up and running with the latest computer technology waiting for his return think about how much technology has changed in the last 5 years how does the heros friend secure a venue for a party at the last minute that just happens to be right across the street from the bad guys office? and how do people who cant act cant write and cant direct get jobs in tv anyways? is the golden age of television really gone?
