nothing is worse than a film that pretends to be intellectual and profound yet is really just a boring rant against society this film is just that the plot is nonexistent the story is full of holes and the only worthwhile acting is done by edward norton i still cant figure out why the main female character was even in the film this is just a transparent schizophrenic bad movie and is amazingly shallow
