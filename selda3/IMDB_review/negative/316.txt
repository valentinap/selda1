in the opening night i walked out from the movie theater totally disappointed to see one of my favorite directors has diminished himself to such a low lever of performance poorly developing plot immature explanation of astrophysics unbelievable and unrelated events and characters especial effects leveled to a disney comedy and horrible music are only parts of my negative impression even mathew mcconaghey did not seem believable looking at her daughter older than himself mat damon probably did his careers worst acting the robot was another annoying part what did anne hathaway and two other guys add to the story? using a laptop to bring down a drown and control an intergalaxy spaceship??? finding a livable planet after passing through the worm hole in another galaxy seemed easier than finding an atm machine in a us interstate highway why would a director hire a blackholeworldexpert as an executive producer to explain a worm hole function by drawing a line on a paper and punch it with a pencil? just reading the worm hole article in wikipedia would give you much more sophisticated knowledge mr nolan looked completely confused in delivering a solid message awareness of climate changes saving human species teaching relativity theory to common movie goers or the power of love each of them bold and superficial
