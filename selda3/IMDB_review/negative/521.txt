as you can figure from the summary i am here to bring the rate down because 82 star as i review this was not justified this movie the story revolves around mason for 12 years of his life and as everybody said this movie is using the same cast filming for 12 years i understand the value of this signature but let me remind you this is not a documentary or a story based on true event it is fictional so first priority must come to writing and boy the writing is awful they managed to make a story less interesting than a 12 years story of any regular boys out there mason changing school meeting new friends abused by his step father got a girlfriend morph to an emo he got into photography what could be more mainstream than that? mason have no depth have no motivation mason is a loser with no direction of life and still not projecting any compassion to his mother some drama make you laugh some make you cry some make you think deep about life some make you want to hug your loved one boyhood does not do any of that 82 rating is a trap only movie hipster critics rate this movie high because of the art and gimmick so if you are a normal person who wants a good story and a good time dont watch this this movie is just 3 hours of watching a boy gradually lose his cuteness and acting skill *sorry for my bad english
