im a modern type of movie viewer but i can appreciate classics like annie hall  midnight cowboy  forrest gump  casablanca etc i simply do not understand what people see in the godfather to start with im not really into the whole crime mob italian sicilian naples mafiosi family thing so it didnt have my attention at that the acting was good but marlon brando was annoying his weirdy voice is infamous but i couldnt understand anything he said it sounded very flaccid and emotionless too the story itself seemed very pointless michael corleone kills a bunch of people mob hits his father gets shot or something he becomes the new godfather or something nothing had shown itself much changed or resolved didnt serve a purpose other than to show a bunch of cursing and killing with thick accents the mood was also very very cold hearted theres a general complaint about steven spielbergs munich that its very cold too that the characters dont have a warmth to them that you can identify with the godfather characters are like this too you cant identify with any of the characters because they seem so heartless and cold not even with a hint of charm to them to make you like them except maybe marlon brando who seemed like a crazy old grandpa whos half senile i cant see the classic status of this movie if it were released today would it receive the same praise
