i was extremely excited to see this movie when it came out boy what a waste of excitement angelina jolie was terrible i swear she only had about 30 lines in the whole movie most of her scenes were of her posing in her costume and looking or trying to look evil stick with the original sleeping beauty movie if you want a movie with an actual plot whoever made this movie focused on what it looked like and the cgi more then the actual acting which was horrendous the whole movie was just eye candyabsolutely no depth to it whatsoever no more angelina jolie movies the woman cant act at all all of these big blockbuster overhyped movies have no depth or plot its like they put all of their energy and money into the visual appeal of the movie and said to hell with it when it came to the actual acting and plot such a shame
