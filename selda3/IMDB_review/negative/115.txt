this does contain a spoiler one that if i would have known i wouldnt have wasted my time or money i dont like to even watch trailers on movies because i want no preconception of how a movie is going to be this movie has single handily changed 30+ years of thinking i thought the story was very well written and acted despite almost always knowing what the twists were going to be until the pace was so slow and could have been compressed into a normal 7585 minute movie my guess is that the reason there was no ending was because they ran out of time for dragging it on like they did when the credits hit the entire audience i was with pretty much let out a stream of obscenities and we all felt like the producersdirectorsstudio all just gave us two middle fingers i could have dealt with the slow pace if they would have just wrapped up the movie
