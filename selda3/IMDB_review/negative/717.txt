 i just got home and i must say that i am not as satisfied as i thought i would be the film is very good but in my opinion is far way to be considered the best of the trilogy both previous movies were more intense than this one the battle scenes are awesome but the rest is very slow and quite difficult to stand for three and a half hour the ending is boring and that scene where legolas beats a mummakill cmon what does an army stands for if a single elf can handle such beast a third part of a trilogy which is in the 3rd place
