it is very difficult to describe how angry i felt after sitting through nearly 2 hours i felt like some smug a**hole who thinks hes smarter than everyone just kicks me in the head spits in my eyes and then call me names i have never felt so insulted by a film but then again i had never bother to watch the star wars prequels the plot is full of holes and the twists and turns are hardly plausible it is true that here are instances good acting can be a saving grace for a bad movie but there is precious little of that in the film the lead characters are unconvincing and tedious bores ben affleck well hes ben affleck sometimes he does decent work but only sometimes the biggest disappointment is rosamund pike i know she is no maryl streep but she is usually not this bad first of all her american accent she talks like she is in some black and white movies from the 50s fine so may be she is channeling some heroine from a hitchcock film but who talks like that anymore okay i am being a nitpicky here my bad her character was supposed to be highly complicated but there was no depth she couldnt even do a halfway decent mimicry of a damaged person its down right pathetic all the supporting characters are awful all except kim dickens she is the saving grace of the film if there is one its wonderful to watch her as the lead investigator of the case of missing wife and the only thing that keeps the movie from flying away like a kite in a wind storm she held on as long as she could all the way until near the end when david fincher ran out of time alas she cannot save this hot stinking pile of garbage somebody please give ms dickens a better position in her career she deserves it the worst one is probably neil patrick harris what happened there doogie? i cannot talk about what is wrong with his character without going into a tirade and spill too much beans so i will stop there doogie stay with comedy please i am glad that not everyone is fooled by this american beautyesque bull doo doo frankly i did not go in with too high an expectation i saw the high rating on imdb but i also heard grumbles that it was not that great the bar i set was in the middle and i still gets crushingly disappointed that is how bad this movie is
