in which pretty much the only aspect that doesnt totally disappoint is the cinematography basically an elaboration of the set design on seven even the soundtrack is lukewarm and sounds horribly dated some brothers or someone norton is the kind of actor whom you either can or cannot watch i havent totally decided yet bonham carter still delivers a phoney stateside accent woody allen obviously hasnt helped and pitt only looks good in his eye to eye hotel room sequence with norton anyone who claims they see him as a good actor is either lying or is deluded  the guy just looks good with cropped hair other than this were looking at a film made for awkward teenage boys who cant watch it anyway cause its mostly rated 18 its the slightly older awkward boys who sadly do get to see it and end up slobbering over it and writing rave reviews about it a little rubbish goes a long way these days having appreciated both the game and especially seven id like to think fincher was presented with a job to be done and got away with it lets see what happens next
