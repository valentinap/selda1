interstellar was supposed to be a cardinal point for mankind at this stage 2014 as far as technological science go and the perspective possibility or not of a new habitat in space it let me so down instead of a true vision for the future interstellar works out an ordinary hollywood blockbuster that vegetates on emotional blackmail in a father daughter relationship sorry christopher nolan but this is not what i payed for why should man go into space if all he cares about is miserable inter human nonsense? the unprofessionalism of the astronauts is limitless austronauts dont go into space without a strict course so not in interstellar in this movie the astronauts choose randomly with course to take this is supposed to be science? dont make laugh what a drivel
