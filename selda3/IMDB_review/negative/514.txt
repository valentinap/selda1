basically this film was a cross between 2001 a space odyssey and gravity there wasnt that much to it the one saving grace was nolans inspired depiction of a 5 dimensional space very neat shame about the flimsy plot dodgy character development and poor script oh yes and the clunky ridiculous robots were fun all in all a waste of money nolan should have made a much simpler film something foreign and arty to stick his cool 5 dimensional bookshelf into the rest of the cash he spent on this would probably have done some good somewhere but such is life silly spoiled directors and their silly spoiled foolish vanity trips boring
