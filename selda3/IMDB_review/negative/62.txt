this movie would have been better if it was only about tars and drones and robots and completely remove humans characters and the damn corny filler dialogue all that hard science special effects scientists working together making it seem most real bound together by fantasy and bullshit and missing plot lines and time paradoxes and love and religion this movie is really a cheeseball hollywood film with a hard science backdrop the characters were as flat as a piece of paper the guy likes the girl the daughter is mad at dad dad loves daughter doesnt care about saving mankind even tars had more personality than many of the movies characters the daughter was probably most developed but felt so off still she holds a grudge 30 years later is a movie for average joe blow using the bedazzle tactic of impressing you with confusing story special effects and hard science when is really no meat and nothing useful tars gets 1010 rest of the movie 110 i have learned nothing made me think about nothing wasted my time
