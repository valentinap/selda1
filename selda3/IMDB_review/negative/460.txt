having built high expectations from an almost 10 out of 10 imdb rating and portrayed as a great spy thriller in the reviews we went to watch the movie but were extremely and totally disappointed and disgusted with everything in the movie the storyline and direction were aimless and weak the actors were made to show off their horribly cheap and duplicate quality james bond type weaponry tricks and style the movies plot and screening seems so stupid that the director would have been better off creating a spoof for a james bond type movie instead anyway such movies always get made but what i am most disappointed about is the fact that the imdb reviews & ratings were completely rigged imdb you need to watch out for such flaws in your feedback system cos that will bring down the rating of your service in process my suggestion if you are really really still interested in watching this movie then wait for a couple of week and it should be on tv for a free time pass
