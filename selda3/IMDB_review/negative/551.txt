a day after the experience i am still trying to reconcile how the man who was responsible for the magnificent subtlety of seven could create such garbage yes the violence was gratuitous and excessive but oddly enough that was the least of this films worries where to begin the plot was ridiculous on its face absolutely incoherent and nonsensical the various themes of the movie were amplified and remarkably shallow showing no real insight into the problems of our society ours is an overly commercial culture this is neither original nor especially interesting especially when repeated ad nauseam finchers direction and sophomoric mtvstyle presentation did nothing to help a script that never got any further than live free or die with minor variations most of the dialogue reminded me of something my high school english teacher used to say when her students ventured out of their league thats so deep its shallow this succinctly describes the handling of every major theme in the film then there are the performances edward norton an otherwise gifted actor does little with the simplistic character hes given there is no complexity to this character whatsoever and norton can do nothing to help define him his early attempts at playing the neurotic are particularly unconvincing brad pitt has more to work with in the tyler durden character but his tendency to overplay absolutely everything about his character even beyond what the script calls for or should have called for makes nortons performance seem that much more vapid helena bonham carter simply showed up
