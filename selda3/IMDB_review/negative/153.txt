the movie chronicles the journey of a group of astronauts traveling through space in search of a new planet on which to establish a new colony of humans due to the physics involved they remain young whilst their family back on earth grow old their entire journey lasts for about 60 years considering the high ratings i really expected this to be an epic movie in reality nothing happens it literally felt as though i was trapped in their tiny little space ship for 60 years the plot is based on complex theoretical concepts but in the end makes no sense whatsoever there is no action no romance no comedy no special effects and very little meaningful dialogue if anything the movie has more of a documentary feel to it the visuals were nothing special and the music reminded me of a superman movie from the early 80s i just didnt get it
