omg this movie was so stupid like really waist of timei even pulled out my cell phone and browsed fb while it was playing because of how stupid this movie was the music at some parts was just so way over kill too loud and too way dramatic the whole story was crap and did not make any logical sense so ur telling us that nasa did not know that the best pilot to fly the space ship was living only about a car drive away from ur secret hiding base? u did build a space ship to fly out but cant have mri machines anymore? a drone was flying for 10 years and no one saw it or knew about it? wtf its like the person who wrote this movie was like thinking we are all so stupid and wont understand who this movie is not making any seance ok the only part i did like about the movie was when they found the bad guy who try to kill the main character that was something interesting and his trying to dock into the space station it was nice story but still none nonsensical bc with time it just dont make any sense so they 2 walk away from the space ship and then when he called the space ship to rescue him u can see they fly so far no way they could of walk that distance then at the same time they rescue the good guy via plane the bad guy can walk all the way back to another plane? while a 3rd one get blown up???wtf and also how many shipped did they send anyways it just did not make any sense to me this movie its just way too stupid sorry but it wasi want my money back
