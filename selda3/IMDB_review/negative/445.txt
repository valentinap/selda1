i came here to check the reviews and i was mislead so here i am hoping that people will see this and not bother first thing that you notice is the bad actingpersonal opinion and man that is annoying the show itself is decent but not much of plot development and the story is repeating and boring so unless they have something hidden that is gonna blow our mind im gonna have to stop watching this show if you have a lot of time to spend you can watch it but dont expect much from it or you will be very very disappointed another thing that hits you after a couple episode is the over the board acting with punch line here and there i know it sounds like a lot of hate but just so you know this is my first review in imdb i always come here to check some of them this show is overrated and doesnt deserve the reviews in here
