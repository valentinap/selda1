although suffering from a muddled plot ill defined characters a typically uncharismatic performance by christian bale and a lack of energy the dark knight proved to be on of 2008s greatest commercial and critical successes the fact that this film is in the top ten list tells me two things 1 most of the people who rated this highly are either 10 year olds or adults with the attention span of 10 year olds i do not mean to offend all 10 year olds because there are some rare exceptions but you can catch my drift 2 people who rated this highly have not seen many of the other better films on this list they have nothing to compare the dark knight to anyway i just hope this films current standing sinks down far below the 250 mark
