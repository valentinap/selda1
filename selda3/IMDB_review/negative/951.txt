fortunately i only caught pieces of this trash on cable where the language and other filth were edited only some sort of strange perverted voyeurism can explain why the redemption of assassins sodomites and other sociopaths garners such attention or perhaps most of the movie going public is not that far removed from the experiences of these miscreants and any message of unburdened hope is received with resounding aplomb the next thing we know people will be claiming pornography possesses redeeming cultural qualities and oscar performances befitting the publicks adulations or has boogie nights already claimed that role whatever the case pulp friction is just another post modern nihilistic romp i guess i can take comfort in the fact that my 1 out of 10 stars vote will depress the rating of this film even though the usefulness of my comment will get many no votes so go ahead and vote away and confirm my suspicions your favorite movie still has a 1 vote in imdb from me and i enjoy watching them add up last count 11 people found my comment unuseful
