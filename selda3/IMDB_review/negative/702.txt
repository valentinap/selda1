 it will put you asleep because of how slow it moves now its not that i don not like 3 hours+ long movies i mean my favorite movie is once upon a time in america its just that lord of the ring the return of the king breaks the record for slowest moving movie half of the movie is just frodo and his friend sam trying to find some type of volcano to throw the ring and destroy it before gollum can get a hand on it the other half is just this big huge battle being fought now you expect a battle to give be action packed and give you an adrenaline rush but this movie does the complete opposite because of how slow it moves and how lame the few battles that are fought end it is a complete waist of time and you should only watch this movie if you have trouble sleeping at night because it will put you to sleep after the first few scenes i am still ashamed of the academy for giving this movie 11 oscars and i am still wondering how it did not win any razzie awards
