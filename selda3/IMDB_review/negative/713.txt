 spoilers this has to be one of the most boring movies in existencewith the exception of superman to me star wars has always been about the action scenes but theres barely any of them going on in this film the sappy romance subplot between han and leia falls flat on its face being too predictable the only good thing was vaders revelation that he was his father to luke and that wasnt even confirmed until the next filmi think i read something about that at one point it originally turned out vader was messing with lukes head all in all a weak film in the middle of the series bottom line the worst star wars movie yes i am including menace
