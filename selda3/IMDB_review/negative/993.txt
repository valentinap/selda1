there were just too many subplots too much violence and it was at least a half hour too long they should have taken some of the time they spent planning cgi effects and used it to seal some of the plot holes 1 a witness pulls a gun out while hes on the witness stand excuse me this is some mythic land where the courthouses dont have metal detectors 2 theres a terrorist threat against a hospital so they evacuate every patient except the one whos been in all the papers 3 the police are transporting a high profile prisoner with dozens of vehicles escorting him and swat teams all over the place but one trailer truck starts chasing them and theyre all helpless 4 the silliest thing of all batmans constant whispering its supposed to make him sound menacing but he just sounds like he has laryngitis its like the old superman tv show where people magically have no idea who he is as long as he keeps his glasses on i know im way in the minority on this one but i have to say this was the ugliest stupidest movie ive ever seen i would have walked out if i werent trapped at the end of an aisle you couldnt pay me enough to sit through it again
