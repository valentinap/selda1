this is an attempt at giving sleeping beauty the wicked treatment tries and fails dismally first of all the magic kingdom is fantastic with lots of bright cgi forest dwelling folk frittering around the screen this will be enough for most small children to get their moneys worth above that this film is awful the plot does not work on any level now i know this is a childrens fairy tale no one is rewriting shawshank here but the story is so awful it is insulting to the intelligence of infants basically the producer has gone down a check list of standard movie elements so we need a flying scene a battle scene a magic forest a princess check check  check check then at the last minute someone remembered they had to hammer the whole thing into an alternate sleeping beauty small children will be entertained by the graphics adults will be dumb founded by the unnecessary moronic story i was left wondering  given the true turn of events  who is propagating the version of sleeping beauty we all know anyway?
