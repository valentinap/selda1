what can be said? the reviewers who love this movie are entitled to their opinion of course but dont trust them this movie is god awful only because of the critical reviews and my girlfriend wanting to see it plus the rent one get one free coupon from hastings did it ever come into my dvd player and if ever a premonition of a terrible movie came true it was with this tripe where to start there is no plot but this is just life you say yeah and if i dont want to be entertained for the evening i will not rent a movie i will just stare at myself in the mirror and otherwise watch another day go by but they followed this kid around for thirteen years or some such bs as that did they? who casted his parents? who scripted his lines what a hoax this movie is so bad that when i returned it to the video store this evening and demanded my money back the staff in unison asked did you watch boyhood? we are so sorry this movie is so bad that it inspired my first ever review on this site wow i could go on
