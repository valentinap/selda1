gone girl is based on a rather absurd premise a careful psychotic plot to frame somebody for your own murder this type of idea is clearly deranged but hopefully it does not cross too many peoples mind the idea was developed much better in the great noir film leave her to heaven where the framing was done in a slightly more subtle way but we do not live in subtle times so here we get plenty of gore and graphic violence even if this would be a spoiler for the few who still do not know the plot the story revolves around unhappy couple amy and nick ben affleck woody and expressionless as usual is creepy nick the unfaithful husband who for half an hour is the main suspect for the disappearance of amy beautiful rosamund pike is psycho crazy wife amy a woman with a demented agenda and several loose screws she manipulates every man she meets and at the end of the movie even police detectives are more than happy not to open an investigation on her crimes just because she is a beautiful blonde and they believe everything she said amys plotting is given away much too soon in the movie so we spend two very long hours just following the demented blonde around and nick getting in big trouble only for amy to resurface and deciding to spend the rest of her life with the husband she wanted to see executed does it make much sense? apparently yes since critics and lots of imdb users loved it
