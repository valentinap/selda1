a man tired of his yuppie condo and deadend job moves into a dilapidated house with a stranger and starts an underground club where young men beat each other up to bloody pulp just for the fun of it when that becomes old they engage in terrorist activities there is a lame plot twist which should not surprise most viewers that blows the story full of holes and turns the movie from merely bad to abominably bad culminating in a laughably ludicrous finale the message of this paean to sadomasochism is that a man has to suffer and inflict pain on others in order tosell tickets what is most disturbing is that many consider this vile piece of garbage to be a masterpiece a sad reflection of our society
