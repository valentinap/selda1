please save yourself 3 hours of your life and read this before you watch this movie im sorry to those who want to say this was a profound moviei feel sorry for you this by far was one of the most unimaginative movies i have seen ever the continues praise of how real this movie is really? if i wanted to watch reality i watch a documentary there is a reason why we have documentaries and why we have movies this was not entertaining thought provoking or even remotely imaginative yes it took 12 years to make so what? i mean they had 12 years to think of a story? or give some meat to these actors to chew on i dont understand how there are so many awards and nominations this movie is getting its as if people who watch movies and who are suppose to be critics forgotten what a movie is suppose to be or how to be critical im not a critic but i have spent years and years watching movies and i can tell the difference between whats good and whats not whats art and whats sh*t rolled in glitter let me break it down story = none acting = uninspiring shallow character = one dimensional cinematography = point and shoot directing = great imaginative writing = none existent if a movie has no story no real depth in character or breaking boundaries in cinematic techniques then its not a good movie i do appreciate the fact that this is a unique movie in terms of its actual built but in terms of a movie no i didnt feel a second of inspiration when watching it and now feeling angry that its taken 3 hours of my life this years movies have been the worst in years at lease the positive side of things is at least it wont take me long to forget this movie
