i was very disappointed after seeing this movie especially after having read so many positive reviews the portrayal of physics and astronomy here is so pseudoscientific and so preposterous that i found myself constantly sighing or scratching my head all throughout the movie i dont have a degree in astronomy or any other science field for that matter but the scientific freedoms that this movie takes are so incredibly blatant and obvious that even i found myself bothered by them even for a scifi its far too liberal in this regard but thats not the only problem with this movie the characters are paperthin and the way events unfold is often irrational or portrayed in a very contrived manner for example an ex nasa pilot stumbles upon a secret nasa base which he found by interpreting strange dust formations into binary code which he then somehow immediately knew were map coordinates  makes so much sense huh? where he is immediately offered to pilot their only rocket which is to save mankind and is to launch the following day because all their pilots are inexperienced and have only flown in simulators whereas the protagonist has flown before many years back and only barely leaving the atmosphere but thats fine theyre sure he can manage an intergalactic journey involving many years of travel deepspace hibernation traveling through a wormhole and finding a new world to save mankind no need for any training or a medical check of course surely hell be just fine he just needs to show up tomorrow for the launch incredibly when our hero performs the greatest feat of space exploration ever  traveling through a wormhole he and his crewmates just play it cool the feat is given no more significance than a casual stroll through a park there are quite a few other examples too where the plot is painfully contrived and makes the whole movie difficult to take with even a bit of seriousness another thing that completely broke the immersion was the very unscientific language that was used all throughput the movie a movie that was supposed to be about space exploration and science youd have to be mentally challenged to actually believe that this insultingly simplistic chitchat resembles anything close to actual scientific language that high level nasa scientists professors and engineers would use this is nothing short of an insult to our intelligence ill end by saying i really fail to comprehend how people claim this to be the best scifi movie ever it seems to me that were stooping lower and lower in our expectations of what makes a film great its almost a standard now to expect a movie to be bad when reviews are surprisingly positive
