i could not have believed quite how bad interstellar is it is truly dreadful after six months travelling with just 12 minutes to go to entering the wormhole the token blackman speaks to the hero who has his suntan intact massa massa what is going on? the hero then takes a piece of paper and explains to the poor ignorant black man how space warps in a wormhole if he didnt know this wtf was he doing on the trip? their understanding of relativity is at the level id expect from my goldfish they give plenty of time to grotesque emotional watching of film clips from earth  for some reason in b&w the hero goes through as dorothy parker said all the emotions from a to b they claim it is a post colonial world but the space suits all have the us flag on them the spaceship controls are circia 1960 poor michael cain is he so short of money that he has to be pare of this shite? to be fair it is unconsciously funny from time to time because it is so utterly clueless avoid this film if you possibly can
