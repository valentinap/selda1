i may drop a few spoilers here so be warned i find it very hard to understand why so many people thought this movie was so good yes there was a good cast yes the special effects were good in this day and age that is expected but the story? teaching that space travel to the moon was a hoax? whats that about? the farmer just happens to be a trained astronaut? his daughter just happens to be a mathematical genius? the lies that are told and this intelligent astronaut is so gullible? the denigration of education as if that is any positive way to save mankind? the striving by the government to have more farmers when it has been obvious since the industrial revolution that larger mechanized farms utilizing fewer farmers are more productive the belief that new colonies can be created by bringing embryos to life? who thought this up? the same people who strive for an uneducated populace? and amid all this somehow commuter space travel is developed? too much bull for me to swallow really folks?????
