watching this movie was a pleasure the acting was outrageously good. a film without special effects and action every 5 minutes just men in prison. all i can say is i would have loved this film to have been longer. the acting from morgan freeman is second to none he proves in this film why he is regarded as one of the greatest actors to grace our screens. anyone who hasnt seen this film needs too watch it straight after reading this review as it will change your opinion on a lot of other films.
