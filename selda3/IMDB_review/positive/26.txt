wow i honestly do not know what else to say except wow. usually superhero kind of movies do not really impress me but this one is incredible wow wow wow wow anyone who loves good directing good story lines incredible acting great art and absolute awesomeness will really really really love this movie. its going to be one of those movies that i will not forget for a very very long time. i was not so thrilled to watch the movie at first because i was very sad and shocked about what happened to heath ledger. but a few years later i was bored and decided to just a movie. i stumbled upon the dark knight and decided to try and watch the first half and if i didnt like ill just look for another movie to watch. well the movie was amazing that i was was hocked from the first few minutes. i was watching intently the whole time. r.i.p to the amazing heath ledger. what an incredible and an unforgettable performance you will be badly missed if you havent watched this masterpiece then i recommend you do.
