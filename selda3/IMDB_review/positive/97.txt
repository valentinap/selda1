what can i say quentin tarantino changed something in movies and this and resoirvor dogs was the ones that put him on the map now i must say this is a harsh movie it shows stuff thats rarely shown in films it is also realistic and heck even funny at times this is a good definition of a good film its well made its well written and its provocative its not the kind of film you turn on on a saturday night for some fun but if you like film you must watch this but i warn you its r rated for a reason i guess the expression can you handle the real world really makes sense in this movie so if your a film buff and you havent seen this what are you waiting for i give this film a 10/10
