this movie has some of the best dialogue i have heard in movies even though it doesnt have a lot of action this movie kept me hooked because of the interaction between the characters for example the entire scene where they are trying to clean marvin out of the car harvey keitel interacting with samuel l jackson and john travolta with a cameo from quentin tarantino this scene was one of my favorite from any movie another scene that i really enjoyed was the gimp scene with bruce willis and marcellus wallace dont know the actors name the only scene that i dont really like is the one with bruce willis and his girlfriend in their apartment even though it has some great dialogue i didnt really care for their relationship but this movie has some of the best comedy scenes and tense scenes like the final standoff as well
