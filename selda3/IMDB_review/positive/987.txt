i still remember the first time that i watched this movie. i expected going into watching the lotr trilogy for some kind of nerd fest full of terrible acting and cringe inducing action scenes. instead what i got was probably my favorite film trilogy of all time. everything truly spoke to me. every part of these movies i have loved and always love. the final movie in the trilogy the return of the king is my personal favorite out of the three. the awe inspiring action scenes wonderful effects and the touching themes that can be found in this classic tale. this is definitely a film worth watching again and again and again. it is one of those great movies that will stand the test of time and will never get too old to watch.  except the fact i hate frodo well thats just me personally because hes such a fanny the movie isnt bad at all. its actually a very good way to end the triolegy. but the ending really there were like 8 different endings to that movie showed us what happened with every da*n characters from legolas to frodo. we dont care 40 minutes of ending that sucked and pretty much destroyed the expectations. also too many dialogs i understand that theres plenty of plot but still they could have cut some of them and leave them for the really-big-fans-ill-watch-lotr-for-7hours. i suggest watch it cut the movie 35 minutes before the ending. rols rois out :]
