tarantino makes great use of non-linear narratives which creates an experience that you will not forget. with a cast of divine actors and a short appearance of quentin himself makes this movie an experience that will a stay in your mind for a lifetime. although if watching with others some scenes are highly disturbing and may put you off mood the movie is a masterpiece of well written non- linear story and there are plenty of laughs to make up for it. in conclusion if you are deciding whether or not to watch this movie in my opinion you definitely should should as it is an amazing movie and it leave plenty of thought for your imagination.
