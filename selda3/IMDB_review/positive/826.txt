it well deserved the 11 oscars it is brilliant these movies will never be forgotten. peter jackson is a genius these movies are well acted visually rich have great dialogue and a great story. i wont bother with the story because it is one of the most famous of all time and pretty simple so i will just get to the movie. revolutionary visual effects cast - perfect. elijah wood is perfect as frodo ian mckellen as gandalf best casting choice ever viggo mortensen who would have though everyone else is also great even christopher lee who i dont think has ever not played a villain but that is just because he is so good at it and of course who can forget cate blamchett who is barely on screen but all the same is excellent. dialogue excellent what more can i say if you havent seen this movie you have not been born yet this is one of the best series created. fantasy 1. lord of the rings 2. chronicles of narnia & harry potter 3. cant think of one worth putting up there have been plenty of duds
