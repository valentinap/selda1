this is one of my favorite movies of all time. my favorite parts are the characters of sam jackson and john travolta jules winfield and vincent vega. quentin tarantino did a fantastic job. other movies have tried to compare but none will. my good friend out in los angeles is an actor and he and his scene partner acted out the scene of jules and vincent driving around town and having a discussion about vincents recent travels abroad. and the writing was just amazing how the writer tied everything together so perfectly. and i think that its the dialogue that drives the movie and makes it such high quality. everything from the gold watch speech to harvey keitels dialogue. quentin always seems to find a way to make the something horrific quite humorous without ever seeming to ask for a laugh. he combines utilitarian prose with flights of rough poetry and a wicked fancy.
