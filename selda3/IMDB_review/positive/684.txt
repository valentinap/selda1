one of best movies in the world history and absolutely my another most favourite movie of all time the unforgettable movie based on a trilogy novel about which most people agree that its as satisfying as the novel. peter jackson has successfully made this middle earth history become real i also give a credit to j.r.r. tolkien for his wonderful novel lord of the rings and the hobbits he has amazingly created a story that feels like a real part of the world history what an outstanding imagination all actors and actresses have wonderfully given their best in this perfect until every detail epic movie we really feel their chemistry one to another. this is also a movie that worthy and enjoyable to watch again and again from which we still get something new even when we watch it for 12th times either a new value or a scene we might have no longer remembered. one of best parts of the trilogy i fell in love with elijah wood after watching its final one the return of the king
