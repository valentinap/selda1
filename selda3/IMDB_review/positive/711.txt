normally a summer blockbuster this huge can never for some reason deliver on both acting and the usual crazy action. most of what happens in this movie is pretty bad and i mean bad. but i am not going to spoil that for you. i have never seen a movie as brilliant as this. every scene in the movie has to be there for if you wood just scrap it the movie would somehow collapse because there is a bit of information the audience did not get. and i have to say that this christopher nolan batman franchise is really up there for me with star wars indiana jones and the lord of the rings. this story really tells you why the joker is who he is and why batman becomes who he must become. because this joker is all about destruction and chaos. really looking forward to the dark knight rises.
