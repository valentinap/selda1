the battle of minas tirith the march on the black gate the quest to destroy the one ring. those are the elements which make this epic fantasy film the best in the lord of the rings trilogy. it contains such an enthralling world of middle-earth that for the lengthly period of time the movie takes place you lose time in yourself to a world filled with mirth and magic. i think those fans of lotr tolkien and fantasy should grab this movie straight away. oh and try buying the extended dvd it contains more scenes appendices and an easter egg below the final scene in the scene selection of each disc. definitely a 10/10. by howlingrabbit334
