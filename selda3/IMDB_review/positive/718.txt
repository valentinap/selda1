no words could give enough justice to this film. it is truly a masterpiece. me and my friend decided to go to see this film in the cinema as we wanted to see heath ledger in this final film. i am so glad i went to see this movie. ill admit that i wasnt sure whether to go and this film at first as im not really a big fan of batman and have never seen any of the other movies to do with batman. i am glad i took the chance to go and see the dark knight because it was such a treat. the joker was my favourite character and not because heath ledger portrayed him. i found myself feeling sorry for the joker and then not liking him and there has only been one other movie that has made me feel that way the godfather. christian bale was great as batman and in my opinion they could not have cast anyone better for the part. heath ledger really did go out with a bang as he astounded me with his acting. the dark knight was truly his best role that he has played well at least thats what i think. my list of favourite movies always changes but i know that this one will stay at the top for years to come. hope my review helped.
