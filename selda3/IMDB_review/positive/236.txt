this movie has many stories to tell. every scene has its own story. i like the way morgan freeman narrates in the movie which makes it all the more interesting. the scene where andy gets beer for his coworkers. also when he plays the two italian singers on prison radio. brooks last few days.and how red comes to terms with his freedom. i recently watched it for the first time and cant believe how i could miss this for so long. i also cant believe morgan never won oscar for this. i cant think of any better performance than this.truly deserves the number one spot. since last week i have watched it 3 times and plan to watch it again. thank you frank darabont for giving us hope.
