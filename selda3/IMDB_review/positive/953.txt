i watched this yet again at the weekend and it remains my favourite film one that somehow continues to get better with every viewing tarantinos witty and lurid script is delivered spot-on by actors that seem to have been born to play their parts most impressive being samuel l jacksons bible-quoting hitman and bruce willis honourable boxer willis usually ups the ante when hes in good company and in this film the company doesnt get much better each character has their own classic scene even the cameos christopher walkens in particular and each scene seems better than the last even when you know whats coming youre looking forward to it with relish add a superb soundtrack that compliments the films retro feel and theres not much negative to say even the beefy running time doesnt detract from the fun its not a movie youll be wanting to watch with your mother as the tongue-in-cheek comedy is as black as it could possibly be but its brash enthusiastic film-making that cant be ignored or - up to now at least - bettered
