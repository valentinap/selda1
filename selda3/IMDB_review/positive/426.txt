the movie is absolutely perfect. outstandingly acted and perfectly directed by chris nolan. the movies only wrong is the fact that the character of harvey dent/two face isnt given enough time to develop his psychological state. heath ledger steals the show and stands out as the best actor in the bunch. the movie gets better and better every time i watch it. it not only surpasses batman begins - previously considered the high-water mark of movies about the dark knight - but one that magnificently transcends the superhero genre. even if this wasnt ledgers final role before his untimely death last year his joker would still go down in cinema history as one of the most creepily unhinged big-screen bad guys of all time. lets put a smile on that face.
