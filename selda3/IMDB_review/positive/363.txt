there are few movies that capture and identify with the american male spirit. shawshank is one of those movies. i dont care what anyones take is on prison treatment or whether you are conservative or liberal this movie is moving. there are three movies in my opinion that every man or developing man should watch: shawshank redemption dancing with wolves and brave heart. unless you are a total pansy these are the movies that will confirm your heterosexuality. andy dufrane is the person in us. red is the person we want to be. aside from the being in prison the job they have is well apt to the people of this great nation.
