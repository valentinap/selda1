this is one of those movies that you just have to see to believe. the only flaw is that the plot is a bit confusing at first to some viewers but will soon be figured out. some parts are almost like a mystery movie. first i have to explain the joker in the dark knight but im not sure which words to use. ledger played the part like hed been the character all his life and there wasnt a single part that i doubted he was the joker. seriously his words came so easily and everything about the character was done brilliantly. as for batman/bruce wayne the dark voice bale voiced the character with suited him perfectly and once again we see yet another perfect example of flawless acting. the karate the strength the intelligence even... it was all there he also looked just like bruce wayne should have. everyone did an amazing job and the make-up for two-face was stunning. like seriously it was so freaky and cool. this is a good movie. if you like lots of violence and comic book characters. believe me. it was spectacular.  about continuity in a lifetime based on friendship and hope.
