if ever a great movie has been made it must be pulp fiction i mean you cant even say that this the film  its just film this is what movies are all about: great dialogues characters you can relate to although they are probably just as distant to your reality as eg the monsters in bad taste and appropriate music its not a movie you can just turn on and watch unfocused though if you really want to enjoy it youll probably have to see it three times or more if youre not planning on doing this dont watch it then of course theres the mystery behind pulp fiction whats in the briefcase although plausible theories have been developed well probably never know for sure quoting the man himself tarantino on the question whats in the briefcase: anything you want to be brief: i really think this is the best movie ever made
