not really a lot you can you say about this film that hasnt already been said. one of my all time favourite films. how morgan freeman didnt get a best supporting oscar for this film ill never figure out. wonderful amazingly written film. the cast are superb tim robins always underrated as an actor. pulls you through every emotion. if you havent seen this film then you you dont know what youve been missing. a must have for any movie buff. it didnt do so well at the box office but this movies reputation has grown over the years through word of mouth showings on television and then of course along came the video then dvd rentals.
