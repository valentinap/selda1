undoubtedly one of the greatest movies i have ever seen. the outstanding performances by tim robbins and morgan freeman left me with feelings so profound of being in that prison with them. be warned that the first half of the film is visually and psychologically confronting. the film deals with fundamental themes of friendship and hope whilst delivering some very powerful social commentary. i am left questioning the state of our justice system. we lock away these threats to society alienate them and subject them to the most hostile and unnatural of environments. then when they have served their life terms we throw them back into society with the expectation for them to live normally and abide by values never once upheld or taught in their filthy prison cells. the shawshank redemption tells a very powerful story. a story that made me laugh and cry. it ignited just about every human emotion i could possibly experience in just over a two hour period of time. a truly amazing film 10 out of 10 from me
