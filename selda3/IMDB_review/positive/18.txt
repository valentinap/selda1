wow what can we say about this film. it is one of the best of all-time that is no question. it has altered my perceptions in a lot of ways. i had not read the books so i felt that i could safely watch the film without nit-picking at all the details the movies had left out. i found some people doing that but even those people said it was still pretty true to the story. knowing that and also getting the thrill of experiencing the lord of the rings for the first time was unbelievable. i had watched the fellowship of the ring for the first time on video and i was immediatley hooked. when two towers came out i had to see it the first day out as well as return of the king. i also did some research on tolkien after that and found some reasons of why he wrote it as well. knowing that he wrote it because he wanted to and not just to make a point was astounding to me he just loved to create characters drama and just plain good storyline. noone does that anymore yet i was truly inspired. i have never been so inspired by a movie. it literally took my breath away i believe we are all living in the lord of the rings. whatever your adventure is wherever your heart is at whatever challenges you face we can all learn from lord of the rings. there is always hope.
