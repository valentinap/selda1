this movie has is all.. good actors good story and a helluva speed all through the movie.. you will never be bored when watching this movie.. with so many good actors in one movie you could think that it would not be a good movie. but in my opinion this is the best movie john travolta & laurent fishbourne ever acted in.. they both are in their peak performance.. one very cool thing about this movie is that you may think that you know whats gonna happened next... but believe me you dont have a clue... i have seen this movie at least 50 times already.. and i could easily watch it 50 times more without getting bored.. it deserves a big 10/10.. if you havent seen it go get a copy immediately..
