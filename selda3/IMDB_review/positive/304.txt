this is by far the greatest movie i have ever seen. christopher nolan reached new heights and created a masterpiece. let me start with the acting. heath ledger is one of the most underrated actors ever. he fit the role of the joker much better than his previous actor jack nicholson. every word he said was more insane than the word before it. his list of famous quotes stretches more than 100 yards long. he is scary mischievous and downright psychotic. his crazy schemes almost always come together and they they push their victims to the limits. christian bale also performed extremely well but not as well as ledger. he was a great bruce wayne and his part was terrifically written. aaron eckhart and gary oldman also performed extremely well and their characters helped make the movie what it is: amazing. the suspense in this movie pushes you to the edge of your patience and when it finally pays off oh boy is it good i can barely find anything wrong with this movie. it is nearly flawless.
