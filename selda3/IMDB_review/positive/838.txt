it is year 2009 and yet this movie is still the best movie i have ever seen. it truly and rightfully deserves to be the best movie of all times. story telling acting directing anything that you can imagine about a movie is so perfectly done. i believe everyone will have his own message from the movie but if you want to see a movie that tells how important the role of hope in our life is you are at the correct address. the atmosphere in the prison the way people feel and the way all these things were put together in a two hours movie
