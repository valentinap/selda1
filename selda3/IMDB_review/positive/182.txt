this movie was one of the best i have seen. the graphics were great. the way they put the whole movie together was just awesome. i loved watching every second of it. the first time i watched it i watched it three times in a row because i couldnt get enough of the movie. the lord of the rings series is just amazing in itself. what they have to go through with the ring and what they have to fight and figure out on the way there. i absolutely loved this movie. one that will definitely go down in the history books as an amazing movie. i think everyone should see this movie and the others before and after it. they might feel the same way that i do about it. i love it
