it almost goes without saying that pulp fiction was one of the most influential and iconic films of the 90s in all honesty it probably was the very top film in this regard i can still remember seeing it for the first time and being amazed i had loved quentin tarantinos earlier reservoir dogs but thought he had upped the ante even higher with this movie seeing it again recently i have to say it remains an incredibly well made and entertaining bit of cinema and even though i have enjoyed all of tarantinos films since there is no doubt in my mind that his three 90s crime films tower above all of his post millennium filmography in those ones he seemed to integrate his obsession with pop cultural references into strong stories as opposed to nowadays where his movie references have become so blatant and full on that they have become an actual handicap of sorts pulp fiction is the movie where he best showcases his style in a movie that is consistently brilliant from start to finish its essentially three stories entwined all on the face of it standard crime cinema tales where something goes wrong but tarantino focuses on unusual details that make them completely original the chief aspect that differentiates them from others is his brilliant dialogue that is never afraid to go on non-plot related diversions in ways that utterly humanises the thuggish bad guys that populate his film the script is full of pop cultural references inventive profanity witticisms and even many moments of wisdom tarantinos primary gift and the one he will be remembered for is his gift for dialogue you get the impression that actors are instructed to deliver their lines word-for-word  this isnt a film that feels improvised in any way on some very odd occasions this can result in some lines feeling a little forced but the pay-off is massive as the script is quite simply genius in many ways this great writing has created some excellent iconic characters it doesnt do any harm either that the acting is top level throughout well with the exception of tarantinos cameo that is _ба hes pretty terrible and should really never act but otherwise its quality all the way with standout turns from samuel l jackson john travolta bruce willis harvey keitel christopher walken and uma thurman jackson probably steals the show with the character jules but travolta is very impressive and convincing as vincent vega _ба you really believe he is a pretty nasty bit of work under the charm thurman and willis play typical film-noir characters namely the femme fatale and the boxer who throws the fight _ба both are excellent while keitel and walken have cameo roles with the former as the very memorable mr wolf while the latter is in an extremely funny role as an ex-soldier who wore a watch up his butt so whats it all about well the title says it all really because this is an unashamed bit of pulp fiction but a wonderfully original presentation of it its influence is other movies such as italian poliziotteschi and american film noir with a huge post-modernist make-over films specifically referenced include the italian connection a black and white gangster hit men are sent to sort a situation out and kiss me deadly a plot revolves around a suitcase that when opened has a mysterious glow it is essentially a crime-comedy with a real focus on humour this means that some of the strong violence is played simultaneously realistically but also for comic effect while the staggered time-line is constructed for maximum impact it is for example a pretty rare thing for a film to kill off a character vincent and then go back in time a little to watch his exploits in another escapade we know he is doomed but cant help but completely forget this fact its one of many reasons that this film stands out one of the very best of the 90s and tarantinos masterpiece
