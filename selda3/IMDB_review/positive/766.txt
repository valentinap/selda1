lord of the rings-the return of the king is surely the greatest movie ever made. i consider that is has the most fascinating plot ever written.the universe of the movie is unique: a fantastic world which includes almost every mythical creature we heard of. elvesorcstrollshobbitsall these make up a charming atmosphere. the idea of a ring that can submit the will of its bearer is surely unique is recalls all throughout the movie.also the love story between aragorn and the immortal arwen is the most original one seen in the entire history of movies. the fate of king debethor reminds us of greek tragedies and the film contains great moral learningsmost in the words of the wizard gandalf. the fantasy and the charming sublime atmosphere make me consider this movie the greatest work or art ever created by mankind.
