quentin tarantinos pulp fiction not only is a fantastic achievement in film making it also conjured up such a different perspective of the potential of mainstream hollywood film a complex tale of murder humor and odd characters suffused with pop-culture references sharp and witty dialog fantastic acting a rollicking soundtrack of multiple different genres and ultimately an intriguing and game-changing story line directed almost flawlessly there are faults as in every film scattered here and there but they are subtle and even with a scrutinizing eye do not remove you from the experience of sitting and feasting your eyes upon this masterpiece on all fronts there is very little else that can be said about this film as everyone and their mothers has seen it hopefully not together bring out the gimp i envy those cave-dwellers who have yet to see it and i urge you to do so right now
