pulp fiction is my all-time favorite movie. ask me to list my reasons and i could go on and on about the acting characters dialogue or unexpected plot twists. but instead ive finally realized just why i love this movie so much. i started to obsess over pulp fiction after i went on the internet and read about all the things about pulp fiction i might have never realized by casually watching the movie: what was in the briefcase what ezekiel 25:17 means even little things like who keyed vincents car. what im trying to say is if you watched pulp fiction one or two times and didnt love it do a little internet research on this flick. believe me after you have read all there really is to the plot you will see three times the movie that you first thought was there and it will all make sense. in fact i only truly enjoyed pulp fiction the third time i watched it. but the plot is certainly not the only reason i love it. all of the characters are memorable and fit into the story like jigsaw pieces. you will ask yourself who the real main character was - samuel l. jackson john travolta ving rhames my little obsession with this movie has gotten to the point where ive taken a survey over who is better - jules or vincent to wrap it up - i believe pulp fiction is the greatest movie of the 90s and think that you should really indulge yourself in a bit of the trivia and make it a part of your world. then perhaps you will agree with me that its depth dialogue and characters make even movies such as forrest gump seem dim-witted and hurried.
