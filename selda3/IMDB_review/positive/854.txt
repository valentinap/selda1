is there anybody out there that was more excited about this movie than i was maybe_Ñ_ but most probably not. ive been looking forward to another batman movie since the credits rolled on batman begins back in 2005. batman is a movie that needs no synopsis even for non-fans. but in case you are totally clueless all you need to know is that batman is a guy that dresses up in a bat costume and fights crime in gotham city. the dark knight continues where batman begins left off. christian bale reprises his role as barman from the last movie and this time he has two new villains: the joker played by heath ledger and two-face/harvey dent played by aaron eckhart. this is no doubt the most hyped movie of the year especially with heaths sudden death and i must tell you it was up to the hype or very very close to it. theres a buzz for an oscar campaign for heath and ill tell you right now that he was absolutely amazing and deserves an oscar or at least a nomination. if warner brothers didnt tell us heath was playing the joker i swear not many people would have guessed it was him. i know i wouldnt have. so is this a good movie or just a good-joker-used-to-promote-an-average movie good question. but an even better question is did you watch batman begins did you enjoy it if you watch this movie youll never want to watch batman begins again because the dark knight will make it look like the worst movie youve ever seen. i promise you. everyone is talking about the joker but harvey dent/two face is equally as good. his make- up as two face will blow you away and his acting is nothing less than amazing. everyone else reprised their role from the last movie
