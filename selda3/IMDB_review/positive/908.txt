im going to be honest about this i like unabashedly violent action films im 42 years old im from texas and i can take it growing up with films like rambo die hard the terminator and robocop i cant stand that watereddown nobloodnoswearing gutless kiddie fare that is being served as action these days i know the real thing when i see it  we used to see it all the time back in the day  and i hardly ever see it anymore which brings me to this movie kingsman the secret service was being shown just around the corner from where i live and because i loved two of director matthew vaughns previous films layer cake and kickass i naturally took the chance to see it i had already read some comments from previous screenings that this film was totally badass and i can now say thats actually putting it mildly this film is nothing short of batsh”t crazy years ago tarantino said in an interview that he had written a james bond script and that he would love to direct a bond film sadly that never happened but ever since i read that i wondered what an rrated bond might be like i dont know maybe matthew vaughn has read that interview too and saw the potential because kingsman is pretty much that an ultra violent funny crazy foulmouthed james bond film with a little bit of men in black and mission impossible thrown in you could say that this is to bond what game of thrones is to lord of the rings where the former cant and dare not go for marketing and box office reasons the latter joyfully and gloriously ventures dirty and very black humor  check bad language  check gratuitous violence  check needless to say i was thrilled but its also a fantastic action film with an amazing cast oscar winners colin firth and michael caine plus sam jackson and mark hamill and spectacular overthetop fightscenes that in some instances even rival films like the raid for their sheer visceral intensity in short if youre as fed up with lame wannabe diehards and terminators as i am go watch this film apart from the rare john wick or equalizer kingsman seems to be pretty much the only antidote to the toothless generic tripe hollywood tries to pass for action these days 9 stars for the film and the story 11 stars for the balls to pull this off the way they did average = a perfect 10 edit ps i recently stumbled upon an article on the importance of r rated movies if youre a film fan especially of films that dont cater to teenagers you might find it as enlightening as i have wwwthefanboyperspectivecomtheimportanceoftherratinghtml
