the final chapter of this great trilogy will just rip your heart out of your ribs i dont know how peter jackson did itand perhaps sucha masterpiece such as this has the right not to be questioned. i loved the first movie its steady pace of adventure is non-stop the characters are loveable the costume is nice the settings are stupendous and the visual effects is jaw-dropping. and i loved the second even better with the battle of helms deep finally winning over my breaking heart with the two lotr movies already gnawing at the bottom i had to say a final farewell to star wars 4 & 5 and welcome the llord of the rings. and with this my heart is fainally complete. the marmaluks are unstoppable and visually great no words could describe the intensity of their presence alone. and the battle of pelanor fields will get you to want to wish you were there yourself and not as an orc though trolls are cool though pales in comparisson with the mass of undead and of course the oliphaunts. gollum is once again as great as ever and the rest of the cast are comendable with great praises going to be due to gandalf and most especially sam the emotional intensity of the film is a full ten and after you cry from the movies story youll cry about why oh why wasnt it any longer and indeed we must now bid a final farewell to our dearest the lord of the rings trilogy the only trilogy to have a complete set of movies with no equals but each other. good bye........ sorry i just dont wanna leave it alone....
