this is the greatest film ive ever seen. american beauty and north by northwest come pretty close but then again i havent seen citizen kane yet. theres not much i can say about the film that wont give away something so ill just give it my unequivocal endorsement. close the blinds open your mind and watch this film preferably four or five times so everything becomes clearer.
