never in my life have i been so much fascinated and thrilled as i was while watching the dark knight. its a peach of a movie and is fraught with every element a movie needs to create history. not everyday you come across a movie like this. spectacular to say the least. the dark knight starts its journey from where batman begins ended and slowly we get into the gripping duel of the batman and the joker as the beautifully crafted story scarily moves into its epic climax. not only is the plot an engrossing epic it has a sense of an agonizing tragedy which hits you and gets into you. kudos to nolan who is maturing with every film for his impeccable direction and awesome portrayal of batman. the way he has portrayed the psyche of the joker harvey dent and batman and the way he has convoluted the story-line by pitting against each other the complicated ideologies of good and evil is sensational. not to forget the electrifying performances of almost everybody who has been in this movie. bale is flawless as usual and he handles the dual role of wayne and batman with perfection. aaron eckhart shines as harvey dent and maggie gyllenhaal does a far better job as rachel than katie holmes did in batman begins. michael caine is as usual proper as alfred but the icing on the cake surely is heath ledger. mr ledger pulls off a stunner and oh man is he not good quite rightly an oscar winning performancedeserving all the accolades that has been showered upon him and sadly his last. may he rest in peace. folks to sum up all i can say is that the dark knight is by all means one of the greatest movies that has ever been made if not the greatest. please dont miss this and be prepared to be mesmerized
