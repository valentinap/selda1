ive watched all films that tarantino directed but for me this pulp fiction is the best of all of them its a little bit difficult to explain this movie this looks like a omnibus and consists of prologue  three stories and epiloguethey seem to be disconnected but after watching everything is connected prologue is about a couple planning to burgle a restaurant and two man from mafia vincent and jules  they takes a order from their boss marsellus to collect his possessions first story is about vincent and marselluss wife vega he is asked to take care of her by marsellus second is about one boxer who refuses to order to lose on purpose third is about vincent and jules again they happen to kill a man and asks a professional to solve epilogue is also them at a restaurant if theres a word describes this movie it must be crazy in a good sense all of the stories are completely crazy full of sex talks and violence and theres no message from this however i do love this craziness i have to admit that tarantino really has a great sense of humor and is good at creating wonderful characters particularly i like jules acted by samuel jackson im fascinated by his way of speak and the scene he recites ezekiel 25:17 its imprinted on my mind also i think conversations of this movie are really amusing theyre meaningless and not important but for instance one about hamburger is awesome every time after watching i come to want to eat a hamburger the story i like most is second the scene bruce willis and ving rhames get caught and they kick asses of stupid two young guys is amazing this is a cheap b movie but its waste to miss this sophisticated story  direction like music and enjoyable acting after watching you may feel refreshing and have a desire to watch again
