sure its gory profane and over the top but i havent seen a film this fresh and bursting with new ideas in a very long time although resevior dogs was nearly as good i totally expected all the negative comments i saw  this film isnt for everyone but its a lot of fun to watch and this is because of tarrentionos cool ideas so if your really into film youll probably like this if youre female or liked titanic or both im thinkin you probably wont
