im sure everyone has covered the obvious genius of this movie so im just going to write about the little things i enjoy im sure many people love to see this movie over and over again but since i have so many things memorized as all of you im sure dont lie i like to space it out and look at it in a fresh way each time too bad it can never be as fresh as the first time but the exhiliration and thrill is still there its so cool how tarantino can put everything he loves about cult movies and throw in some very spicy international women into the brew not to mention surf guitar and cartoon homages and present ethnic slurs in such an inoffensive way that it shows the whole inanity and ridiculousness of it all i also like how quentin puts little things that you can catch brand new after 20 or so viewings you might not have noticed or even have cared for that matter but in almost every scene theres a little thing going sometimes on the edge of the screen that makes this more than a hip ultraviolent cult fave i like how the scene involving christopher walken and the young butch walken almost changes every word in explaining butchs fathers death for the sake of butch and his mother also at the end if you pay attention to the extras in the resteraunt they look like real bystanders in a hold-up i also sometimes find myself asking questions about the characters and imagine them outside the movie like rosanna arquette and eric stoltz i always imagine them getting high and cheating on each other not to mention tarantino putting questions out there for us what is in that suitcase after all
