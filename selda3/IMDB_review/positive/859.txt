intersellar what christopher nolan has done so good with this movie was that he kept the plot simplebut we know that its christopher nolan so it not going to be a simple movie its not the overall plot is that the earth is dying so coopermatthew mcconaughey and a team of scientists must go and find another place to live the acting is greatwhat makes it so great is cooper and his daughter every time they were together it was wow the visuals were on another level if you cansee it on the biggest screen possible some people may not like this movie because it talks a lot about science and many other things but you enjoy that you will have a blast with thisoverall interstellar is a must see i think it was nolans best film
