this is definitely the best film of the 90s closely followed by seven and fight club tarantino breaks the molds of the gangster film and gives a great and at many time comedic look into the lives of two hit men bruce willis also gives his best performance ever mostly because he doesnt say much in the film the music is just perfect as with almost all of tarantinos films if you havent watch this film watch it right now i think for me at least the most drawn out part of the film is vinces interactions with mia mostly because i find myself partial to sam jackson anyways this film is a great go watch it then watch it again then ask yourself what does marsellus wallace look like
