to be brief as a man who has watched thousands of movies in my life shawshank redemption is the best movie i have ever seen. the plot the way it develops the acting the portrayal of every human emotion and the ending makes 99% of movies seem like just a waste of time. i didnt see it until a few years after it came out. my sister said it was a great movie. it was on hbo so i watched it. i was speechless. i have always found it strange that it was from a steven king novel. ive read a few not that one and what comes through in the movie doesnt seem like anything that would be in a steven king novel. a better movie may come along but it may be a while.
