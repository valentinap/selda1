quentin tarantino has to be one of the best directors of the 90s and pulp fiction is without doubt one of the best films ever made this film also has one of the best casts ever assembled the list of big names is endless if you havent seen this film then you need to watch it as soon as you can you will not be disappointed how it won just one oscar i will never know it defiantly deserved more in my opinion if i had to describe it in one word it would be cool from samuel l jacksons speech to john travolta and uma thurmans dance when all the story lines come together it is magnificent and it is one of the few films that deserves a 10 star rating
