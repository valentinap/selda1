in my opinion its better than the ordinary monte cristo story that we all know as the greatest escape tale  so this time the escape is greater and the hero is an ordinary man  who is so patient and hopeful while you watch the first few minutes of the film you may think that its social or silly story but minute by minute you will recognize that you were wrong its a brilliant storya never seen before  a very powerful drama .. the best thing in that movie was the relations between characterslike hatingand true friendship like the one which was between tim robins and morgan freeman i like this movie and i advice every one on the planet to watch it as soon as possible....
