with the final installment coming through everybody can recognize the greatness of not only the return of the king but of the trilogy as a whole. despite not being a fan of fantasy movies i was completely taken by the magic of the story and particularly peter jacksons incredible ability to transform such a complicated story into an epic movie and raise the scales of film making. the return of the king grabs audiences and places them in with the characters one by one. it is no surprise at all for the movie to swap 11 oscars and we all surely will be looking to the upcoming two installments of the hobbit to see if peter jackson can outdo himself. rating: 10/10
