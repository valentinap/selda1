what can i say.. this was the best batman movie ever.. what performances the details in this movie were superb. coming from an audio background myself the detail in the sounds design and post-production was incredible. i can only imagine the amount of tracks necessary to create the effects and foley. my hats off to all the cgi folks. i really look forward to great graphics and they did just that. for those that have been watching batman movies for decades the villain played by mr. ledger will make you tremble with fear. the way he truly developed and embraced this character is unreal.. he became the joker. i always having a saying.. you are good as your last work its a shame it was his last. this movie is one to buy and keep as a collectible. go get it
