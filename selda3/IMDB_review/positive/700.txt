now i see what everybody was talking about. it took me 4 years to see this in my opinion masterpiece. if you have not seen this movie rent it anyway you can. the performances delivered by robbins and freeman are to me the pinnacle of both their careers. this film cannot help but evoke tactile imagery to the fullest capacity. you feel what the main characters are going through the sensation is uncanny. robbins andy and freeman red are a balance of the human spirit. andy is your freedom-seeking hope side and red is your rational pessimistic counterpart. find your equilibrium in the shawshank redemption.  aragorn turns to his men and says for frodo....then little merry and pippin run full speed. i have seen this film easily by itself about 15 times as a trilogy roughly 10 times. from shelobs layer to the battle of minas tirith it doesnt leave much to be desired jrr tolkein did a fantastic job writing the book and peter jackson did an amazing job portraying it to the big screen. if youve yet to see lotr watch it from the start and really take notice of everything because it has a lot to offer if you like being told a story. excellent 10/10
