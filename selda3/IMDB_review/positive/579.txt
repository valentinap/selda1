really after all this time why write about shawshank now well simply its still the best movie ive ever watched.... 10 times. this is a movie that from start to finish keeps you engaged like no other film. when it concludes you wonder how a 2 hour plus movie can go by so quickly. no bathroom breaks or snack breaks during this movie whether its the first time watching it or your tenth. just sat down and watched it again 2 nights ago with my daughter 12. she too never moved from the couch and loved the film. this film will hold up to the test of time because its simple: great writing great acting great directing and watchable over and over.
