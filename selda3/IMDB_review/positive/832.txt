it took me a while before i saw this movie i read the plot and saw a trailer but it didnt quite managed to catch my attention i had the idea that it would be more of a kids movie one reason was rocket the raccoon yesterday i finally watched it and boy was i wrong the guardians of the galaxy is a random band of rascals made up of an assassin a raider two bounty hunters kind of and a huge blue guy hungry for vengeance for different reasons they find them selfs fighting an evil set on destruction on epic scale that is threatening any planets in the galaxy now you think thats really nothing new and youre right it isnt but take my advice ad see it if you have any interest in scifi action or comedy you will find all three the performance is good at worst and excellent at best the whole range from cgi and environments are perfect right down to small details and corny things like a precious walkman goolge it   see it just do
