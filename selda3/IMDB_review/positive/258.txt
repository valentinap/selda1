this is without a doubt my favorite movie. every time i see this movie i feel touched by its magic. most of my friends have seen it because i have recommended them to do it and they have all loved it. robbins freeman and whitmores characters are the ones that i like the most. it is just stupid unfair and shameful that this wonderful movie was not awarded neither at the oscars nor the golden globes. the imbd voters have it at #2. my hope is to see it in the future at #1.
