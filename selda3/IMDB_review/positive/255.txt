this is without doubt my favourite film the acting casting soundtrack story and direction are in my opinion second to none it is violent and thats not why i enjoyed it so much although i can see why some would not like the film because of the excess of the violence but it is funny moving and had me on the edge of my seat throughout youve got to see it at least once maybe not as much as i have watched it possibly or you are missing out
