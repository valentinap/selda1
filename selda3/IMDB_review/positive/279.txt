this is really a great movie i loved this movie and it doesnt get all it is a classic and and from my point of view the the best tarantino movie this was made for all movie lovers an extraordinary visual adventure for the spectator the acting is really good and the casting is amazing there you have the two mob killers vincent vega and jules winnfield the duo john travolta and samuel l jackson was the best ive ever seen then you have the boxer: buuuutsch bruce willis there is also the wolf not the one from wall street played by the wonderful hrvey keitel there is also the the extraordinary wife uma thruman brings it to another one as mia wallace the screenplay is really interesting because it involves three parallel stories told to the spectator through different chapters sometimes you have movies known for the one big scene but in this case it is impossible to only take one two or three scenes the whole movie is a classic and a must-see before dying
