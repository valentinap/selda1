wow so many 110 & 1010 reviews seems theres something with this film that is incredibly divisive after reading many reviews heres what ive found many people forgot this is a fiction a grand glorious tale a moment of wonder and fun and adventure heres my rebuttal to all the naysayers deriding its science and improbable hero actions wizard of oz star wars watch the ending without music for a total roflmfao alice in wonderland narnia the lord of the rings only three of these stories involve wormholes two have a talking lion another has trees that walk around one has a cat that rips its own head off and turns invisible in bands and the believability of any of these movies is absolute zero good thing that theres overriding reasons to watch a film joy entertainment a fun adventure interstellar is a staggering glorious wonderful journey i left totally sated feeling light and wonderful its a beautiful brilliant rollicking through space and time 1110 purely for enjoyment
