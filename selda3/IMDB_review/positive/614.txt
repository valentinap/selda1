pulp fiction is one of the two best films ive ever seen the first time ive seen the film was by chance but i found it great and have seen it 11 or 12 times againfor me its a real kultfilmgerman  you get hooked in their mindless conversations and invest in their characters the soundtrack will make you bob your head throughout the whole film and bobbing it hours after youve seen it its safe to say it is brilliant and really suits the film perfectly and when listened to sounds like it was perfectly made for a specific scene in the film this film quentin tarintino on the map as one of the directors to see because of the jazzy cool vibe his films have the directing is good with great uses of one shots and experimenting with transitions and angles such as the angle in which john travolta and samuel l jackson get their guns from the car boot but the main star of the film is the writing the writing is genius and flawlessly executed by the actors you will be quoting this film a couple of years after you see it if you pick any line from this film it will probably be a good one basically this film is a masterpiece and defined a genre that many writers will try to do
