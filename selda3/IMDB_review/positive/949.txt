i went to watch this film not knowing much about the background of the story or what it was exactly about it started off well although in my opinion it did drag on for a long period of time before they actually ended up in space this does not effect the film though or my rating one bit as it all worked out in the end and the build up was necessary the special effects in this film are awesome and are used in a way which i was literally at the edge of my seat in shear anticipation suspense and a slight sense of nervousness its very tense in many parts and it certainly keeps you thinking i dont know how people in the right state of mind can give this film a 1 star or say disappointing rubbish stick to batman nolan these people dont know what they are talking about and are just trying to be picky and find a way to make the film look bad its a brilliant film something suitable for all the family definitely a film for everyone one of the best movies ever
