the lord of the rings ... best trilogy and movie ever made. the cast as they have been all the way are excellent. woods frodo changes well during this film while astin is touching in his portrayal of unerring friendship. bloom and rhys-davis had less to do but came into their own during the battle scenes - adding both action and the odd comic touch that still counts as one being accepted by the audience as a chance to break the tension. mortensen is the title character and serves it well with mckellen also continuing his strong role. i could list through the whole cast but i will stick with noting two things. firstly both monaghan and boyd had bigger and more meaningful roles and rose to them well. secondly i continue with my belief from the second film that serkis is the stand out actor of the trilogy. his gollum is so much more than an effect - he is tragic fearsome hateful and funny. praise of course goes to the special effects for making this character tell so much with an expression but to pretend that the work of the actor is secondary to the character as opposed the look is foolish. he deserved one for two towers so i hope an oscar goes his way. it was a shame to not have screen time for lee but the film works well without him and it was a brave move by the editors.
