this is a film that demands your viewing visually emotionally and mentally do not let that scare you let it entice you and draw upon your wonder of the unknown and the curiosity of discovery i suggest you see this film with someone whether that be a friend family or significant other prepare for a few tears a few laughs and prepare to be baffled and mesmerized this is a film that pushes many limits and some might say the limits of its audience but i see that as a positive this film will remind you of 2001 the tree of life apollo 13 and insomnia for those looking for the link to christopher nolans other work insomnia is your best bet this carries all of the same acting writing and directing marvels of that film dark knight fans may be shied away and fans looking for the action of inception may leave feeling cheated but ignore them this is a film for people it is a personal and human film its most tender moments will cause views to draw on emotions and relationships in their own life it reaches beyond the screen asking some very personal as well as philosophical questions the film in the end may not have all the answers or even explain itself completely but is does not suffer from these aspects but rises higher because of them the movie is not perfect but it is not supposed to be perfect just like the first maps drawn or the first exploration into unknown waters there will be missteps and wrong turns i am keeping this short to avoid giving anything away go see this film with an open mind and it will reward you in every way it is a giant step forward in modern cinema it is a film that will be discussed for years to come and it is a film that has the power to affect the viewer something not many films in todays market can boast i cannot remember the last time a movie truly left me speechless there have been films i have wanted to watch again right away films i needed to process or films that had me deep in thought this film not only achieved all of the above but truly and honestly left me speechless the film will demand a great deal of the viewer including the three hour runtime but like any great adventure the reward at the end is greater than the sum of its parts
