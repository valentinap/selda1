the dark knight in my opinion has to be the best of the dark knight trilogy. with its dark background and superb acting this has to go down as one of the best batman movies ever made. heath ledger delivers as the joker. christian bale is also good at playing the role as batman and bruce wayne. all of the other supporting actors and actresses did a splendid job of doing their part. this has to be one of christopher nolans best masterpieces out of all his movies. the many action sequences in the film deliver with great camera angles and amazing stunts. the way heath ledger portrayed the jokers evil side was tremendously good in many ways. bale is also tremendous too bad we wont be seeing him in the batman v. superman movie. if you are a batman i recommend watching this movie you will not be disappointed.
