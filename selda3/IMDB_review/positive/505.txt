the dark knight is a film of many talents that puts director christopher nolan on a high list of directors who have made masterpieces but this tops any other film you are thinking about right now. the cast are tremendous and put performances in like youve never seen. this movie came out in 2008 and still to this day is held as one of the best movies created by man. may i say the imax scenes are spectacular to date. and one last thing the script it is perfection and will give you such memorising lines to quote to your friends if you ever go to a fancy dress party dressed as a character from this movie.if you havent seen this film then find some time and watch it because you will be amazed at how bloody good it is.
