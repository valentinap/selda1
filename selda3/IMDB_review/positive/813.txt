its hard where to start in such a great film i shall begin at the start in the early scenes of pulp fiction two hit-men come to interrogate a mad named brad although it is not a normal interrogation the language used is very witty and comical this is what makes it my favourite scene what also is comical about this scene is where brad begins to stutter and summer jules begins to threaten him waving a gun in his face whilst delivering his famous what phrase jules is one of the top characters of the film he clearly has more power and intelligence than his sidekick vincent he also is the main speaker of the film a few times throughout the film he delivers his famous bible quotation before executing his victims but as we progress in the film jules understands he has been saved by a miracle and he slowly begins to turn his life around john travolta and samuell jackson were great actors in this film and i think this was the beginning of jacksons acting career this film was well thought through and the final result was beyond expected its no wonder that fans spend so much time debating what was in the suitcase as pulp fiction leads you on a trail of mystery throughout the whole film you think you will see the contents of the box but you never do it is discussed but the item is never revealed the film has so many astonishing details many of which you wont pick up on the first viewing every time you watch it you pick up a detail that went unrecognised before what is the movies purpose exactly marsellus is the sort of character who is mentioned over the entire film while being unseen most of the time marsellus has extreme power over his men without even being present this power is what gets vincent to act in ways you would not ordinarily expect from a dumb stoned gangster faced with an attractive woman whose husband has gone away
