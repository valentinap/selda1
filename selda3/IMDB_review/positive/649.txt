peter jackson one director one trilogy amazing combination a director who made us live each and every moment of the lotr no one could have made it better. the whole cast and crew was lucky enough to be a part of such an amazing journey and delivered world class performance frodoelijah wood is just too good as an hobbit carrying the burden of the ring gandalf  ian mckellen is just unimaginably powerful aragorn  viggo mortensen  being the king of minas tirith is too awesome to resist the other character like legolas and gimli the old rivalry turned friendship is fun to watch. overall a movie made once and can never be made again and shall stay that way for long years to come in fact words fall short writing a review about such an epic fantasy adventure. i wish there was 11 to vote...
