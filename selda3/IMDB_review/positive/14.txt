wrote this elsewhere copying cause i dont feel like doing a new one ill start this by saying that this may not be for everyone metacritic currently has it at a 75100 which is understandable the movie can probably be best described as the campy james bond type spy movie for the modern age it takes the risks that no bond movie will probably ever take again not since the disaster that die another day was they make no attempt to hide this and halfway through the movie make it pretty clear that its what the film is going for without breaking the fourth wall until itkind of does break the fourth wall a little to enjoy the film youre gonna have to turn off whatever part of your brain governs rationality and skepticism because the tech and gadgets used here will cause your eyes to roll if youre expecting this to be a skyfall style spy movie seeing posters for this did nothing for me when i first heard about it then the trailers grabbed my attention what i wasnt expecting was just how violent it was going to be the action sequences are over the top to the point where the agents are superhuman again youre gonna have to turn your brain off a little to enjoy it if youre incapable of doing so just dont bother seeing it if you can i think youll enjoy it most of the theater who got advanced screening tickets applauded quite loudly twice they applauded the first credit screen then partway through it there was a bonus scene more applause at the end im not quite sure how colin firth has never been cast as a gentleman secret agent before he absolutely nails it samuel l jackson is actually pretty delightful as the villain with a disdain of violence not exactly a spoiler as this detail of his character was in trailers micheal caine is actually a touch disappointing in his role i feel like they really underutilized his talents wasnt expecting mark hamill to be in it but was pleased with his appearance and his british accent was completely believable if i hadnt seen pictures of hamill prepping for star wars 7 i wouldve thought he was just some random british middle aged actor mark strong was solid in his role but nothing too fantastic the big surprise to me was taron egerton who i had to look up ill admit the lead of the film the guy who kind of looks like josh hutcherson it honestly is quite impressive to see him go from this british bruv to towards the end of the movie a sophisticated secret agent with honestly the charm and wit of james bond the transformation is believable and impressive looking back on the movie that may be my favorite thing about it and given that hes only24 i think? i dont think its completely absurd to consider him to eventually replace daniel craig maybe hes not the best choice but hes made my list might not grow out of his boyish face but if he does he should get a call anyway aside from the individual performances the movies plot is completely ludicrous in a fun way the violence is over stylized but the humor is quite fun after seeing all the comedies ive seen certain jokes are just predictable and kingsman has its share but some jokes are quite surprising tldr summary intentionally campy a lot of fun if you dont expect a serious spy film quite funny super violent at times i can only really compare it to 300actually no this is more like a spy version of kickass really but its not quite as gory more entertaining than most movies i saw last year if theres a sequel i will watch it also sophie cookson may just be my new celebrity crush and also my ticket was free through the advanced screening service im signed up for but when i find time im gonna pay to see it againin 13 ****ing days edit back to the kick ass comparison i think if this is well enough received as it was for me and the friend i took to see it it may enjoy the same cult classic status luckily forit it will come way before the big blockbusters of 2015 will hit theaters may give it enough time to gain that appreciation in my personal opinion its better than kick ass
