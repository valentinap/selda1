this movie is excellent why most importantly it is original it can be said quite accurately that many elements of this film have been stolen from other films no one can ever accuse quentin tarantino of not doing his homework repo man or la femme nikita as obvious examples he even rips off much of his own material from reservoir dogs but the manner in which these elements are chosen and assembled is both inspired and original many people have stated that pulp fiction has been proven great by the amount of imitation that it spawned frankly i dont think imitation proves anything and i dont think pulp fiction was imitated significantly more than many other highly successful films however to my mind pulp fiction is great because it manages to recycle a multitude of pop culture icons that were seemingly over-used to death and somehow put them all together into something fresh and interesting pulp fiction also has a few truly original moments christopher walkens wonderfully dry delivery of the your father kept this watch in his ass for years story is hilarious there is only one serious flaw in this film: quentin tarantino is a very poor actor thank god he confined himself to a small role if he really feels the need to be onscreen he should just go ahead and pull a hitchcockian cameo in his films sure its derivative but at least his screen presence will be minimized
