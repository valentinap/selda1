you dont go and see a tarantino written film without expecting to see guns gore vulgarity and everything else associated with graphic violence it is his style and he is a master at it the fact is if you did not like the film and you knew he was involved you can only blame yourself this particular film was well written kudos to roger avary for helping tarantino the film is definitely oscar material that is why it received so many nominations in top spots best picture best actor best supporting actor best supporting actress and best director to name a few unfortunately i believe the violence prevented it from winning any of the major awards but tarantino and avary did get oscars for writing it their is talk about quarter pounders in france foot massages and what its like to kill a person if you can follow the film which basically runs backwards and if you are not offended by topics like violence rape and drug use you are probably a tarantino fan already finally who cares where tarantino got his inspiration from 80% of that film was exactly what you expect it to be and 20% of it is surprises for you his fans travolta jackson willis rames and thurman have my highest regards for a job well done i give the film a 10 out of 10 >
