this was my first movie ever.i mean it when i say that i have never been interested in jack squat before watching lotryesthe caps is important. i saw it in bahrain first in budaiyafor those of you who dont know where bahrain isfyi beautiful placemust go. anywaysi couldnt believe the story line and the details of the characters and where they come from as well as their homelandsits a completely different feeling whenever i watch it but i will always have that feeling in my mind that im watching something worthwhile which is better than whats out there nowwith one question. what wouldve happened if i never saw this movie i told my best friend at the time and no surprise he got hooked too. i think anyone in the world will agree with me when i say that lotr is the greatest and most respected movie series accompanied by of course the godfather. just ask aguero.and im an arsenal fan
