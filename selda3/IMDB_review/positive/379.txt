the shawshank redemption.the best movie i have seen yet.its adapted from a novel by stephen king but this is a special film even better than the novel i suppose.best adaptation yet to walk through in international cinema. the great camaraderie between tim robbins & morgan freeman is very difficult to surpass.wowwhat an on screen display by both of them. if robbins was fantastic then morgan was emphatic.brilliant acting by tim robbins.the best by him so far.even he would admit.morgan freeman comes out with an en-lighted performance.his dialogs in the film are truly inspiring & heart aching.fantastic work by him.an epitome of performance by morgan freeman.the rest of the casting is good.james whitmore as brooks is a revelationso is bob gunton as the warden. the plot is superb.ending is classy.you can never make out what happened in the end.its such a travesty that you have to watch it again.the directorial of frank darabont is top stuff whereas the screenplay by him is very much adulated.the dialogs are so memorable you will always carry them along.here are some of the best dialogs from this: andy dufresne: they say it has no memory. thats where i want to live the rest of my life. a warm place with no memory. red: let me tell you something my friend. hope is a dangerous thing. hope can drive a man insane. andy dufresne: thats the beauty of music. they cant get that from you... havent you ever felt that way about music red: we sat and drank with the sun on our shoulders and felt like free men. this movie is the epitome of all others.no movie can emulate the camaraderie between that of those two shawshank prisoners.must watch for a fabulous & thrilling experience.
