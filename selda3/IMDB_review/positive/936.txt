if boyhood came to our theater in topeka i mustve missed it ive been on a quest to see this years nominated films so janet & i finally rented boyhood on amazon prime instant video great historic effort movie i can see why hollywood insiders have nominated it for a best picture oscar i give it all 10 stars  not so much for its story there isnt much of a main point running through all 12 years but for its neverbeendonebefore achievement rent it if you get a chance  but be aware that it is rated r for a lot of profanity that said i do think that the harry potter films did something similar by casting the same 3 lead actors and some others during 8 movies over a 10 year period
