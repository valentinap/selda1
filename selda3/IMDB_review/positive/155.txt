to put it simply this is one of the best movies i have ever seen writer/director quentin tarantino obviously spent a lot of time carving out this masterpiece quentin prides himself on being very talented at writing dialog and he proves it here more than in any other of him films in my opinion be warned though this movie is not for the faint of heart as it has sternum puncturing needles drugs and a lot of violence but that just adds to the movie for me the plot lines are masterfully interwoven and the characters are lifelike and very believable when i turned 40 i did something i always wanted to and rented out a movie theater and the one film that i chose for my friends and i to watch was pulp fiction it is at the top of imdbs top 250 and it is on afis top 100 for a reason it is master craft film making and it is one of my personal all time favorites
