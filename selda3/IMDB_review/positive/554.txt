similar to at least one of my fellow reviewers this is my first review if it happens to be my last as well i wouldnt mind this movie warrants a review the night before seeing interstellar i had watched stanley kubricks 2001 a space odyssey which may have been the best movie of its decadecentury as well i was blown away by the beauty and grandeur of kubricks masterpiece and i was worried that seeing it so soon before interstellar would lead me to great disappointment in nolans film fortunately this is not the case interstellar lived up to kubricks odyssey and will be one of my favorite movies of all time nolans movie certainly didnt surpass odyssey the two occupy a very different space no pun intended in my mind and in the annals of cinema i can say with confidence that the two of these movies have illustrated the glory of what can be achieved in a scifi film and they cause all others to pale in comparison even the recently released and acclaimed gravity has no such weight compared to these two masterpieces another great pun without spoiling any of the film i would like to discuss some details that impressed me the  is phenomenal the acting is powerful and the special effects are superb but perhaps my favorite aspect of the movie are the apparent nods to kubricks odyssey which made the dualexperience even more significant certain elements of the film reminded me of kubricks jupiter and beyond the infinite sequence the mysterious monoliths even the legendary hal9000 even with these slight similarities so much of the movie was different and in enough ways bolder such that interstellar feels incredibly fresh and original christopher nolan cowrote and directed this film which only further solidifies his status as one of the greatest directors of our generation even with his hardtomatch lineup of prior successes this movie is a phenomenal standout the runtime felt very appropriate and just like odyssey i was pleased with how many things were addressed after what seemed like logical stopping points please treat yourself to a theater experience of interstellar if you love scifi if you love the realities of space and astronomy even if you only love great film making you will love this movie
