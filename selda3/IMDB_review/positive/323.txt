this film or may be masterpiece changed the whole outlook of mine towards life. the characters played by morgan freeman and tim robbins were so real and so closed to my heart that i cried and i laughed with them while watching it for the first time. we learn from books we learn from our parents we learn from our friends and we learn from movie like the shawshank redemption.once upon a time i was going through a bad phase of my life and bit depressed also. then some suggested me to watch this. what happened next was simply miracle. the pain endured by tim robbins was no less than mine. but it was hope that kept him alive. that infused a new joy in my life and i achieved success in very little amount of time. the dialogues are simply straight yet touching. the movie has universal appeal - it can move anyone because characters played by freeman and robbins are so close to heart. double thumbs up to stephen king and frank darabont for teaming up and offering this life changing piece of cinema. this movie was not made for oscars although it grabbed multiple nominations and not for critics some critics ridicule about its number position in imdb 250. it was made for common people like us. humble salute to all who were directly or indirectly associated with this all time classic.
