not many people i knew of had confidence in peter jackson when it was announced he would be bringing these movies to life 11 years ago. me and my friends all loved heavenly creatures and bad taste is fun to watch but we werent confident in jacksons ability to make a blockbuster based off a book series i love to death. happilyi was wrong when we saw the fellowship of the ring in theaters. i found to be a successful tolkien adaptation and a great film in its own right. the two towers came and went and i was feeling confident about the final chapter in this epic trilogy. then came the day. i went to my nearest theater bought snacks plopped into my seat and had to datethe greatest film experience of all time. i literally sat in my seat not wanting to leave middle-earth behind when the credits finished. the adaptation was incredible. parts that felt odd in the book flowed better in the movieand changes were made that i still dont complain about. the acting was stellar the highlights being elijah wood sean astin viggo mortensen ian mckellan and bernard hill. the chills that went through me during the rohirrims charge the quiet explanation of death the entire climax at the cracks of doom and frodo leaving forever deserve to be hailed as some of the greatest moments in film history period. the music sound and visuals still hold up to date which to me says something. now as we wait for further news of the next peter jackson movies detailing more adventures in the lands of middle-earth we should take the time to look back onto why this is even possible. thank you peter jackson for making something that cant be ignored.
