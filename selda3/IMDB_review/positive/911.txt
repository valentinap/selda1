im a fan of david finchers work fight club seven the social network the remake of the girl with the dragon tattoo—i just dig the guys work and the films hes behind yes even alien 3 so gone girl was going to be one i was going to jump at to see and when i factored in the story and the cast to the partnership of fincher behind the camera and trent reznor and atticus ross once again helping with the  i was almost assured to love the film and then it had to go and be something even better as a story gone girl is griping and shocking it hooked me in and didnt let go for the entire ride it even stuck with me well after the movie ended it was heavy dramatic and even chilling and all these elements were made even stronger by an unbelievably talented cast that delivered like crazy with their roles affleck was fantastic as nick dunne neil patrick harris looked at home in the thriller genre and tyler perry was very entertaining as the defense attorney tanner bolt however as great as they all were they all pale in comparison to the performance of rosamund pike words fail me at truly summing up how awesome she was in her role because she was capable of being sympathetic and chilling at the same time the only phrase i can think of to really showoff how incredibly pike was is oscar worthy if she doesnt win best actress for her role in this film then all that is awesome in this world will die a little gone girl is just incredible and solidly put together the story never drags or gets boring and unrolls at the perfect pace that kept me hooked and kept surprising me at every turn overall just a tremendous movie filled with tension and heavy drama hello my name is rev ron and if you feel like reading more of my rants ramblings bad jokes geek references and other movie reviews like a more indepth look at gone girl and other films with ben affleck in them you can visit my blog at revronmoviesblogspotcom if you dont want to do that because you disagree with my opinion of the film and now hate me and wish me dead going to the extreme is what the internet is all about then you dont have to visit—but please dont wish me dead thats just going overboard
