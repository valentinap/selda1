possibly the most important movie to be released in the 90s everything about this movie is perfect from the brilliant dialogue to the flawless editing right down to all the little details in virtually every single scene my all time favorite scene still has to be the adrenaline shot sequence at lances house the banter between the characters in that scene is so realistic and dead on that i almost forgot i was watching a movie quentin tarantino is one of the only directors next to paul thomas anderson who seems to have any kind of grasp on what can make movies the best art form ever created
