one - word tarantino   in far 1994 as you know there was a decent number of very interesting and qualitative movies such as: escape from shawshank frank darabont leon luc besson forest gump of robert zemekis  transfer of all these pictures can borrow much it is a lot of lines but it is most from listed above in my opinion quentin tarantinos movie _ pulp fiction in due time this picture made furor both on critics and on film fans the movie received the oscar for the best scenario was nominated for sets of awards and in general is recognized as one of the best criminal tapes when or removed why _ it received this rank in my opinion it occurred from _ for courageous approach to violence impudent talks and the extraordinary scenario written by the director tarantino managed to make simply cult movie which it is possible to reconsider one hundred times of a weak and simple plot to tarantino anybody such didnt do anything and infinite imitations from which i can distinguish cards went then the money two trunks guy ricci and barry zonenfelda though even they near reading matter are destroyed about actors conversations are absolutely excessive after all everything likely is already told to me john travolta sam jackson uma thurman bruce willis tim roth harvey keitel christopher walken and great and awful quentin tarantino _ everything coped with the roles unbelievable my result pulp fiction _ the movie simply phenomenal before it cheerful interesting and extraordinary above any estimates
