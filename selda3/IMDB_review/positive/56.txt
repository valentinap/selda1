when we learned about the new batman series i thought it would be a total failure. batman begins really proved me wrong and i was set up to be pleased if each of them was as good as batman begins. lets just say this movie blew away the first one and 99.9% of every other movie ever made. bale played batman perfectly the best yet. what really made this movie as good as it is was heath ledgers performance as the joker. it was one of the greatest performances ever he simply nailed it. michael caine was the usual michael caine he was great. another person that made the movie as good as it was is aaron eckhart he played harvey dent just like i imagined harvey dent. then when he became two face and his personality and whole character changed he nailed it too. of course gyllenhaal and freeman were great as well and the rest of the cast. if you havent seen this then do yourself a huge favor and see it.
