quite simply tarantinos best and arguably the best film ever: pulp fiction with a star-studded cast and non-linear storyline to back up complex characters and realistic dialogue this film cannot easily be beat i have seen this film probably about 10 times and every time i learn something new: what pack of cigarettes butch smokes what the hell a palooka is the outrageous and sadistic ways of senorita villalobos etc this film is enticing at every turn with a soundtrack to die for and the goddess of editing ms sally menke it is simply amazing also the fact this epic was made for only 10 million dollars what film with 30 times that budget have trouble sticking in the same league as this piece what is all comes down to is the fact that quentin tarantino is the motion picture craftsmen of his generation and the best of the past 25 years sorry marty
