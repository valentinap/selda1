this movie is just as great as the three before it. the camera angles lighting and effects were amazing. i am so proud of the actors viggo orlando elijah ian and everyone else without this amazing cast lord of the rings would not feel the way it does. andy serkis props to you for your amazing portrayal of gollum and all the effort to get all those jumping shots in. the camera crew showed their worth with the excellent filmography. ever angle gave meaning and ever sound effect chilled you with pride. with all these factors i feel proud to be alive when beautiful films like this are made for us to enjoy. intense nostalgia grabs me when i watch this film now and i couldnt be more happier.
