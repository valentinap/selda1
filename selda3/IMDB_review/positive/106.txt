what a great experience. this movie capped off a 3-year journey for me - one that included my first time reading the books including the hobbit and the silmarillion and several viewings of the movies. each movie holds a special place in my heart but i think that this last one is the most satisfying. ill forever remember the beacons being lit and pippens sorrow-filled song. probably the most poignant moment though is gollums look as he gets to hold the ring one last time... and then the eagles coming... as a whole i feel ive accomplished something coming out of this experience. id like to thank the movie-makers for this experience... for it truly has been fulfilling and life changing.
