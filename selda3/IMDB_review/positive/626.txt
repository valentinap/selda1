pulp fiction is a great movie that can bring generations together. my parents grandparents and even my younger siblings all enjoy getting to relax and enjoy this movie that will give you everything you want in a movie. for those who have a weak stomach or dislike movies with any blood at all i do not recommend. however if you are willing to suck it up and watch a movie where witty remarks are constant throughout the movie and have the possibility of making you think just a bit to understand what was meant by the characters. this movie is one of my favorites because it does a fabulous job convincing and getting you to suspend your disbelief. i will never forget the first time i watched pulp fiction and listened to the logic of robbing a caf’©. from that moment i knew that this was going to be a well done and fantastic movie that could compel me to believe what was going on and fear for the characters within this world of pulp fiction.
