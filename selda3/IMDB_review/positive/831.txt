it was a day like any other. wake up early morning eat school jack off etc. etc. etc. i would come back home from school shower eat then try and find ways to waste time. i would flip through channels like a magazine or probably treat myself to a snack. the thing that made this day special was that i was going to watch imo the greatest movie of all time. before watching this movie my taste was.... generic to say the least. my favorite movie was the a-team. my taste was horrible. i recently watched inception so i was slowly being... devoured or welcomed whichever way you see it into the movie world. after watching this piece of art however i was just amazed. the acting was amazing. the directing was pitch perfect. and the script... oh jumping jesus on a pogo stick the script left me speechless. i envy those movie watchers who get to watch this for the first time. anyways fast forward a couple of months later i already watched
