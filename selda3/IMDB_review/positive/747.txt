maybe for me and i think most of true batman fans at first glance this isnt comic book batman that i was expecting. its marvelous how nolan succeeded to present in one movie batman that is so realistic and that we can connect to it and really be pulled into movie and that he preserves all craziness of joker that is demanded from his character. batman movie can be done in various ways and one reason is because batman and his greatest enemy have no superpowers and i see that as a good thing because then you have more space and need to present these characters not as someone who can really exist but as someone who put you more into movie and unreal world of comic book at the same time. he put this two things together in something that almost everyone would watch and like but without losing true representation of dark knight.
