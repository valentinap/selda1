this movie brings back lots of great memories so im biased anyway... nevertheless a lot of people feel the same way about this piece. im sure of that. the return of the king sums the trilogy up more than nicely. so well done. with lots of blood sweat and tears put into it. you feel it by watching it. lesnies cinematography is a perfect fit for the epic landscapes and the breathtaking visual effects. i have to mention that i never read the book but from a movie standpoint the story works just fine for me. and even to i may have overseen some goofs here and there it all makes sense in the end. for those that havent had the pleasure to watch it in cinemasi recommend getting the extended version dvd the one with all three movies included. the included making of is one of the best made behind the scenes looks out there.
