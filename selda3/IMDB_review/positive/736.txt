much has been written and praised deservedly so about the shawshank redemption. the fact that its #1 on this list gives me faith in humanity. instead of talking about its obvious care with excellent writing directing editing and cinematography ill just say how much the film has meant to me personally. its message of hope and above all perseverance kept me going through many of lifes travails. i think i responded to how it dealt with the day-to-day grind of life albeit in dramatic fashionand even the stress of boredom. the other thing it demonstrated was how profoundly one person can affect another without even saying much to them. after all andy and red only have one true baring-their-souls conversation in 19 years together one of the greatest scenes in the history of movies by the way. yet we are fully aware of how much these two meant to each other and how moved we are when they are reunited. its a real spiritual journey visually as well  it is before these walls that the doom of our time will be decided. the city is a spectacular achievement by the special- effects artisans who show it as part fortress part emerald city topping a mountain with a buttress reaching out over the plain below where the battle will be joined. in a scene where gandalf rides his horse across the drawbridge and up the ramped streets of the city its remarkable how seamlessly jackson is able to integrate computer- generated shots with actual full-scale shots so they all seem of a piece. jacksons achievement cannot be denied. the return of the king is such a crowning achievement such a visionary use of all the tools of special effects such a pure spectacle that it can be enjoyed  tolkiens story is so sweeping and jackson includes so much of it that only devoted students of the ring can be sure they understand every character relationship and plot point.
