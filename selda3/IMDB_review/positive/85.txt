what to say this trilogy sets up a totally new standard of filming and if anyone wants to compete with this piece of art surely have a big job to do. cant tell you how much i enjoy watching these movies. totally a new world visually very impressive acting at very high level to action keeps you entertained during the whole movie and watching these three movies makes you sad because they least only 11 hours . cant have enough of these movies. its been 11 years since i watched for the first time and i still feel hungry for them. i think that many years will pass until someone will make a better movie than lotr and in my opinion for 50 years this trilogy will keep very high place on imdb list because these movies are timeless.
