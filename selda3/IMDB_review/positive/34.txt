with more than 3000 reviews there isnt much to say about this masterpiece. but it deserves many more reviews. this is a film of a lifetime. seriously. it crosses all the lines of its genre in order to give all of us a showcase of every name involved. not only christian bale or health ledger are unforgettable. everything in this movie camera script performances story action direction is at the highest and beyond. its a movie made with style and groundbreaking aces on the hood. it could be shocking that this movie is so considered in all film lists across the world. but be prepared to be moved and surprised. at present day the filmmakers can still deliver masterpieces to audiences than can destabilized the ancient classics. this is a new classic. and it even deserves the #5 spot for me. my own parents guide: sex & nudity: 1/10. very poor content of this and just passionate kisses. violence & gore: 8/10. this is not a so violent or graphic movie but when it comes its really intense and sometimes upsetting the jump scene with the false batman two face looking most of joker attacks against people which includes plant an explosive inside a man stomach kill one man with the infamous magic trick scene.... profanity: 5/10. some language but not so remarkable. alcohol/drugs/smoking: 3/10. very poor content again. nothing too much relevant. frightening/intense scenes: 10/10. its not about frightening except for the jump scene but it does about intensity. the whole movie is brilliantly dark and extremely real with people and situations really hard and truly moving at times. this is the most intense batman movie. even more intense and violent than the next one: rises. total: 27/50. despite this can be a so low mark of explicit content in a so convoluted movie like this one its a really not for kids movie and one of the most intense superhero movies ever. and the most disturbing in batman trilogy.
