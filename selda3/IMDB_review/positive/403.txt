the shawshank redemption as a film is the most powerful and moving films i have seen and regard it as the best of all time yes there are many grate film out there many that are over looked by many people but as this film has shown box office ratings mean very little in the grand stage time a film that ca be classed as a true classic is one like this thats stands the test of time with grate acting and filming this one move people in ways other films can only hope to do. an it transcends all ages and class with a true hart felt tale of two men over coming adversity in a truly horrible place like the shawshank prison in this way it moves me to think how would i cope in that place if i could at all stand that kind of life for that long but it has a lighter side to it as andy get one over the worden and escapes the cells to freedom
