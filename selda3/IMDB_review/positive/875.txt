in my opinion this is the one movie that is absolutely the greatest the first time you watch it. its probably my favorite movie. it may not have the replay value of some of my other favorites but the first time you watch it when you dont know what is about to happen is the probably the greatest thing you can experience in terms of movies. i only wish could i forget it so i could watch it again for the first time. as a matter of fact if i ever suffered complete amnesia there would be at least one definite benefit. i am not going to talk about the ending and for gods sake if anybody puts a spoiler warning on their comments do not read them
