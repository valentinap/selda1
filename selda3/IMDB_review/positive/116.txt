well let me start off by saying i felt compelled to write this review to spite the numerous people who give it a 1 out of 10 because they feel it should be lower then a 9.3 and go on to write what they really think to you people i write this: you should vote it according to what you think the movie should be i.e. if you think the movie deserves an 8 out of 10 then you should vote as such i think this movie deserves a 10 out of 10 and so i have given it as such. as for the movie i cant tell you how incredible it is in my opinion it is the only movie to date i could watch again and again and not get tired of watching it the cast was spot on everything was perfect the subjugation of the prisons by captain hadley all of it was simply spot on honestly speaking i dont know how people could watch this and fail to see how truly amazing it is well deserving of its number 1 spot on imdb. also i read that people dont understand how andy pinned the pictures to his wall it could be either celotape or bluetac and as you see during the movie andy works from under the poster when digging his hole so there is no plot hole of how he put the poster back up after entering the hole because the poster never gets taken down.
