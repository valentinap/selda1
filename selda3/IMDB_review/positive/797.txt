ive heard of this movie before i saw it to be honest not a single disagree on the perfectness of the actors or the production or the story or the dialogue man when i saw it i agreed and supported it to the last very minute its one of the best movies i ever watched and it really deserve to the 1st top movie in the american cinemas history ... id like to thank all the people who worked in or share in it i give it up for their great effort that will last in every ones memory for his life time. im sorry for my weak expression as i am impressed and my words may fail me i did my best to deliver what i think. hope to see new production with this kind of quality and this kind of mastering in every single detail.
