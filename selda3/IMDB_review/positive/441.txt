the lord of the rings was a unique film made by a director and cast that were in tune with the book from which it was taken. it has been a privilege to see all the 3 movies almost impeccably true to the spirit of the book. it is with great anticipation that i look forward to the hobbit to be made in new zealand and know that sir ian mckellan is looking forward to spending a year there reprising his role as gandalfhe has just said so - 20 minutes ago on bbc news. im sure it will be made with the same dedication to detail that marked the sequel lotr.it will be made more enjoyable now i have a large screen with which to view the spectacular scenery of new zealand once again.
