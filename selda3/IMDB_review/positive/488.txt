the dark knight is the second part of batman franchise with christian bale the movie is great with solid acting performing action directing. everything is perfect the ensemble of the cast is great. watched dark knight rises as well. the batman franchise with christian bale is the best. dark knight is one of my favourite movies of all times because of the action and of course i love christian bales acting. i sure do hope that there is another batman movie after dark knight rises because i can see this from every fan that its gonna break all the records. just like dark knight rises topped all the charts. i loved heath ledgers acting as well nice to see some aussies doing great in hollywood loved the part where he blows up the hospital and the way he walks i even met christian bale in person he is a great guy doesnt disappoint his fans. i really really hope that they make another batman movie with christian bale in it and anne hathaway they look cute together or they could make batman and robin hood.
