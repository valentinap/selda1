lotr: return of the king is an amazing movie. i saw the trilogy on december 16th and was very impressed. it was all that i expected and more. obviously a must see but i think it was just that much better because i got to see all 3 one after the other. hats off to mr. peter jackson for a great interpretation of j.r.r. tolkiens masterpiece.
