i saw pulp fiction back in 1995 on video i was amazed can you really make a movie like this a film with too much bad language violence booze and drugs its just too incredible to describe but it has it all and above everything else it has quentin tarantino a man with great bad taste he came up with the stories picked the music for the sound track wrote the screenplay and directed and made john travolta a star again samuel l jackson and uma thurman reached a-status in hollywood people dont realize what an achievement that was anymore
