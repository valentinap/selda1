is the dark knight best film ever made for me yes. the dark knight is a film thats fantastic on the action front seeds its acrobatics in its own reality and always feels relevant even when its ideas are drowned out by clatter. its just the best batman film ever. its just the best superhero movie ever. its more than a money-spinner a franchise a comic-book cash-in. the dark knight is a stunning piece of work that deserves every word of praise spoken about it.christopher nolan is much much smarter than your every filmmaker.this film is more than a comic-book adventure this is a sprawling epic crime. anyway chis nollan and batman for me  is a best picture.
