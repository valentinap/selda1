there are only a handful of films that have shaken me to my core and continued to resonate with me for very long after their first viewing. i can happily say that the shawshank redemption has stuck to me since i finished watching it for the first time and instantly rocketed up my top 10 films list. most great films have one or two obvious flaws that can be easily picked out - not so in shawshank at least not to me. the hefty run time doesnt put me off because the story and characters are just so well rounded and so easy to return to time and time again. shawshank is one of those films that i would love to experience for the first time all over again. the thrill of emotions and the highs and lows i felt that first time are incomparable to much else. in my opinion forrest gump was not as deserving of the best picture oscar as this. the timeless feel of a story of friendship in a hopeless place will likely continue to capture generations of people for years to come.
