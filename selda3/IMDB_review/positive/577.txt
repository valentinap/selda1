recently i had one of the greatest cinematic experiences of my life i delved into richard linklaters wonderfully organic and profoundly moving masterpiece boyhood for those of you unfamiliar with the film boyhood chronicles the life of mason played by ellar coltrane as he wades through childhood from ages seven to eighteen sounds like the plot to a movie weve seen a few thousand times right? wrong boyhood shatters all hollywood norms with groundbreaking style story and originality its unlike anything youve seen before for starters linklater actually shot the movie over twelve years following his actors as they age both in their roles and in real life since 2002 the cast of boyhood gathered for a few weeks each summer to film the next chapter of masons life its mindboggling watching coltrane literally mature on screen in a compression of his life since 2002 because of this the film doesnt feel like a movie at all but more like an epic poem or a series of subtle moments that collectively define what it means to be a boy in the 21st century this unique directorial style transcends our expectations of what a movie should be and allows linklater to explore the nuances of his characters like an author would in a great work of literature young mason lives a largely unassuming and ordinary life he doesnt battle with cancer make a monumental mistake in his love life or fall into a dangerous cycle of drug and alcohol abuse unlike all hollywood films about childhood filled with fictionalized plots that attempt to tear your emotions apart boyhood remains grounded in reality masons story isnt meant to make you overly sentimental he goes to school moves houses splits time between his divorced parents all of it seems trivial on the surface linklater could have easily slipped into a melodramatic hollywood trap of depicting a rebellious boy who feels alone with his tribulations in a world that seems too rigid to satisfy his needs but linklater holds true to a vision of ordinary life and within that ordinary life linklater collects moments of ordinary beauty in one scene a high school senior offers mason his first beer in eighth grade moments later mason and his friends start throwing a circular saw at a wooden board for some exciting fun the whole time youre waiting for something scary to happen for someone to lose a finger for one of the seniors to pressure him into doing drugs or for the police to show up yet nothing quite so sensational happens because linklater isnt trying to entertain us hes simply showing us a scene of modern childhood mason has his first illegal drink his friends test their fate by doing something dangerous and stupid moments like these elevate boyhood to a state beyond pure entertainment and the film ventures into new uncharted cinematic territory its the first movie that has ever felt like a true memoir documenting all those little snippets of life that influenced us in delicate ways growing up even if we cant pinpoint one defining epiphanic moment but its not until after the final scene until after you sit in front of the black screen for minutes that you come to an earth shattering realization you just watched a movie about you boyhoods final scene shows masons first day at college as he reflects on his childhood and attempts to figure out what it all means life living people and thats when were shellshocked because we are mason we lived his childhood thought his thoughts dealt with his changes laughed his laughs cried his sorrows its that impalpable quality which gives linklaters film power the movie screen becomes a mirror sums up all the emotions of nostalgia pain and happiness weve ever felt in life and lays them back into our hands the feeling is nothing short of spectacular
