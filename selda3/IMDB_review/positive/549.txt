so there are basically 3 cinderella films now that will be forever referenced the original animated cinderella ever after and this live action cinderella i wasnt a fan of the original animated film when i saw it as a grade school kid but i really enjoyed ever after when i saw it as a college student now as a grumpy middle aged man i was reluctant to see another retelling of this classic story but my wife really wanted to see it so i gave it a shot glad that i did because i believe this cinderella is the best of them all this film does an excellent job of blending the realism of ever after with the fantasymagic from the animated film it also truly excels in showing you the depth of the relationships between cinderella and her parents and the prince with his father  even thought the onscreen time between the parents and kids is limited lily james as cinderella does an excellent job of showing frustration while maintaining her promise to mom  to be kind to others in other words she showed her humanity and wasnt just some sort of animated caricature its a shame movies like this dont often win best picture or best actoractress because the acting is that good in this film  all the way around go see it but bring some tissues with you
