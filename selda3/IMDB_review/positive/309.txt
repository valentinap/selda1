this is an amazing film it keeps you on your toes from the start all the way until the end i would suggest it for anyone to watch although its 2 and a half hours long not once was i bored i would suggest this film to anyone it really is amazing its amazing gripping thrilling and highly intelligent it has a superb twist and you never expect what happens this film is exciting and im so glad i got to see it for once id also suggest watching the trailer as it doesnt ruin the film although most of them do i would happily watch this film over and over as its surprising but yet it is still interesting
