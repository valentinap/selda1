what i can say is this is a really great movie. it tells use there exists brightness in the darkness and never gives up hope. you will succeed in the end. and also be ready at any time. maybe it is because of language problem i dont grasp it very well in the beginning. but step by step i understand it. and in the end i understand it and especially the result is out of my expectation that doesnt happened in the movies i have ever seen in the past. and also the performance skill is another thing i like it. they are good actors. and this is the movies that seldom take man-women sensation as topic but still give people good feelings. great movie encourage you while entertaining you  also for the perfect story. peter jackson has showed everybody that he can do the lord of the rings from book to movie. i will also give some credits to the best writer ever: jrr tolkien. he was in the beginning a ordinary teacher until he write a little sentence: once upon a time there was a hobbit who lived in the shire. this little hobbit was bilbo bagger. but back to the movie this is the best movie ever been made. viggo mortensen is fantastic as the role aragorn. but dont he have more beard in the end of the film than in the beginning. but the actor that i think is the greatest in the lord of the rings company is sean astin alias samwise gamgi. he make his performance so fantastic. the emotions is really coming forward here. i love the scene when sam takes frodo on his back to carry him the last steps in to the fires of mount doom: i cant carry it for you the ring... but i can carry you so finally i just want to say: this is the greatest movie in the modern history...
