im a huge fan of christopher ive been waiting for this movie since i heard about matthew teaming up with christopher for their new movie i dont have words to explain about this movie this movie is a masterpiece based on the importance of the humanity how important our species to us? whom will you save when you get the edge of your life? is it the species or its just your family or you save yourself and leave others? do you follow your heart or your mind? these are the questions we face when we watch this movie cast is excellent christopher explained about a theory theory which says that we are not alone there are beings out there who are superior to us or its just usthey who will evolve in the future one thing is for sure the person whos going to watch this movie should have some imagination skills and a good grip on physics i got a lot to tell but i dont want to spoil the surprise go watch it dont miss it one in a decade movie
