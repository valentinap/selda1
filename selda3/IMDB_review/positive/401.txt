the shawshank redemption did not win best picture because it will remain to be an example of how a movie does not need to win some sort of award top be considered one of the most prolific experiences an acting production can make someone go through. this is not just a movie...its an experience that everyone need to partake in. i have maybe only seen about 450-500 major motion pictures with about 80% of them being produced after 1980 but this is the only movie out of all where i actually forget these are actors acting in front of a camera with a movie crew. do you know what that means --it means not only frank darabont but every single person involved in this film fused so well that they truly made a piece of artwork that puts people in such an emotional trance they forget whats happening for 2 hours. this is what every director and person who works in the film business dreams about...making a movie this groundbreaking. the shawshank redemption will show you how true friendship can arise from anywhere...even in a prison--where people fear the most to be in. --maybe it shows the intrinsic drive humans have to create a social bond in any situation. sometimes when i talk about this movie to people i feel really disturbed when someone has not seen it. i feel like saying are you insane
