richard linklater brings us the juggernaut that is boyhood boyhood is a roller coaster of emotion and sentiment seen through the eyes of a young boy over a span of 12 years the film has a very intimate feeling that i have never experienced watching any other film it was hard not to relate to mason through out some parts of his life goodbyesfirst loveslost friendships and a constant struggle with the world around you boyhood is a once in a lifetime film a movie where time is real a film where we get to watch these characters grow making them feel like they are a part of our own world certain people dont seem to praise boyhood as much as other reviewers and critics have probably because there are no intense hollywood esque moments where a character gets an epiphany from the heavens everything in boyhood feels very real and personal making it a very intimate and beautiful to watch a journey like nothing ever seen in film
