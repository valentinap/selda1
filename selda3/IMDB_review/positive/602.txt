pulp fiction the magnum opus of quentin tarantino is an absolute visual treat the exemplary usage of nonlinear story-telling will leave the viewers open mouthed backed up by some very powerful performances by the cast the film has become a benchmark for all black comedy films the screenplay by tarantino artistically narrates the incidents concerning a particularly interesting group of people the film is replete with iconic moments like the monologue perfectly delivered by jules winnfield samuel jackson the twist dance routine of mia wallace uma thurman and vincent vega john travolta and the mexican standoff in a diner however this masterpiece is not recommended for the faint- hearted as a lot of r - rated violent scenes of great detail are interspersed in the film the soundtrack has been compiled quite tastefully misirlou sets a funky tone for the film during the opening credits structurally the film is divided into seven sequences which have connected stories as expected the cameo from tarantino himself as jimmie the distraught husband in arguably the most entertaining part of the film - the bonnie situation - proves to be the cherry on the cake
