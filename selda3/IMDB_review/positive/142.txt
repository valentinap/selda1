very few movies that made me cry ... and the shawshank redemption is certainly one of them. i remember when i first went to see this movie in my freshman year in college. the movie made me appreciate freedom and true friendship. very powerful picture indeed and each actor deserved an oscar for their great performance. it is sad that the movie did not get the true scale of recognition it deserved but being on the imdb top 250 movies of all time based on peoples votes is a great way to show the well earned appreciation. if you did not watch this movie yet then you missed a lot
