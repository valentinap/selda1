theres nothing in life more meaningful than endlessly talking about movies and theres no discussion as entertaining as fighting over which was the best year for films. i always go for 1994 mainly because it produced three movies that are truly unique and show up in every best of list you can imagine. i mean its pretty tough to find a person that doesnt have either forrest gump pulp fiction or the shawshank redemption in their personal top ten. while the first two movies still have a considerable group of opponents to some people forrest gump is too much of a tearjerker while pulp fiction apparently glorifies violence too much the shawshank redemption is one of those movies nobody can really dislike. its a movie that goes beyond matters of taste the story writing and acting are so undeniably good that its tough to come up with a counterargument. writer/director frank darabont is also a fantastic dialogue writer particularly when it comes to bit characters. you can also see this in the somewhat inferior the green mile characters who only have one or two lines say the perfect line on the perfect moment. the amazing performances by tim robbins and morgan freeman do the rest. the best movie ever made its definitely up there.
