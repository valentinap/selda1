ive never seen a series like this. a trilogy of movies created with such love and care and utter perfection of craft that you cant help but walk away and wonder how did peter jackson make this possible i have always loved the original star wars and indiana jones series for their epic storytelling and just for just fitting in as a great moment in cinema. this should be will be remembered with as much revered fondness for generations to come. they do not make films like these anymore. as a stand alone film it picks up immediately where two towers ends so brush up before seeing it. ive read the books and the anticipation of seeing some of the more profound moments in this film made me kind of view it with a rushed sense of perspective. i wanted to make sure everything in this film was done right. and when it happened it was. i will need to see this again to enjoy everything on a more casual level.
