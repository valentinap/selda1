the movie was great and the acting of christian bale was out of this world.i think he is the best actor of present era. the story line of movie was great. the only shortcoming that i see is when they attack the city and the scenery they show of city is not very good  very suffocating. beside this the movie was great.the movie has live up to the expectation. the message given in the film is very good. i want to salute the guy who have written the dialog of this batman movie series. the dialogue are just amazing and their delivery is killing. you want to hear the dialogs again and again . believe me. the gadgets of the batman are amazing. i specially like to talk about the caretaker of wayne house. mr. pennyworth he has done his role very effectively. in the nutshell  the movie is great and totally worth your money.
