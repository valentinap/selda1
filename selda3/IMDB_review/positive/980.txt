i think that i might have ruined this movie for myself i watched this movie over and over ad nauseum in my 20s i think that parts of it are dated and should remain in the 90s vault but i think that for the most part this movie is transcendent for anyone whos ever read my other comments youll know that my idea of a masterpiece is a movie that pulsates with a mystical otherworldly vibe and id have to say that most of this movie is like that this movie has been parodied by the likes of the simpsons and been referenced by serious critics and for good reason this movie definitely resonates with the archetypal sophomore vibe
