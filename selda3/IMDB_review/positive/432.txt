the most amazing thing about this movie is its pioneering spirit they look at night sky and see a map of foreign worlds that need to be visited the movie presents lot of mysteries of the world in visually fascinating way those robots there are amazing as well complete opposite of marvin from hitchhikers guide to the galaxy i love them the emotional layer is as great as it gets you may very well find yourself crying possibly more than once finally the imagination was mind blowing rolling around the edges of the things you are yet willing to accept as possible it all feels very real like you are right there travelling across the universe encountering strangest parts of physics
