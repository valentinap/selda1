this movie is one of my all time favorites. undoubtedly one of the most brilliant movies i have ever seen. story cast screenplay all are great. the directing by frank darabont was just magnificent. the amazing casting of both morgan freeman and tim robbins is amazing and couldnt be more accurate. it was narrated by morgan freeman who is the best narrator in hollywood i believe. actually the film depends on the story and the way in which it unravels. it will change the way u think about things around u. surely it will teach you one thing that it is easy to take away a mans bread even his freedom but impossible to take away his hope. i can say with confidence this is the best movie i have ever seen - or ever will see. if you havent watch it yet just go watch it now  you couldnt just hold off on the rest of the series if the fellowship of the ring didnt pan out financially. the emotional payoff of the film is testament to the work on all ends of production for everything from the script to the on-screen talent to the set decorators to the sound designers creates the aura of authenticity that makes this fantasy feel so real and convincing while also pulling us along on an emotional journey in which we feel so heavily invested by the time frodo and sam reach the summit of mt. doom. as with their journey in the story once youve gone this far as a viewer youre incredibly committed to the outcome and what an outcome. bravo. ~steven c thanks for reading visit moviemusereviews.com
