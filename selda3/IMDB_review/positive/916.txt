ill start off by saying that i have loved the lord of the rings my whole life. peter jackson took middle earth then and turned it into a whole new experience. the first two movies which were astounding culminated in this epic ending to a great series. from the perfectly constructed minas tirith to the final destruction of the ring peter jackson made middle earth come alive. while there were major deviations from the book such as the army of the dead fighting at minas tirith instead of pelagir these are for the most part necessary and in the interest of time: any longer would be unbearable. a die hard book fan like me ive read them six times may be slightly upset with the exclusion of certain events the movie is still astounding and will be among my most re-watched.
