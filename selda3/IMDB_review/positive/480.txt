the dark knight was a marvelous film. it shows us what a city might be like with potentially unstoppable criminals and corrupt police officers. my favorite content that the movie had was showing us what can really happen. corruption has taken over gpd and gothem is becoming a horrible city. some of the criminal tactics are just horrific. a world where the police have no power can scare the bejeezus out of anyone. the cast and soundtrack were also excellent. my favorites were morgan freemanlucky # slevin and aaron eckhartthe black dahlia. christain bale was also excellent in the film. the soundtracks were terrific. hans zimmerpearl harbor soundtrack made the movie come to life. everyone knows that a movie is not a true movie without an excellent soundtrack and the dark knight truly proves that point. imagine the movie titanic without the music. it would not be as good. same thing applies for any movie. the movie was an excellent action thriller. 10 out of 10 stars is not enough
