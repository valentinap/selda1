this is the best the dialog between actors was great absence of a single staring role was very appreciated all the character parts were diversify unique and all were developed appropriately every seen had an unexpected twist yet never leaving you confused or trying to lead the audience astray i was completely absorbed never finding a dull moment or having time to try and figure out what was coming next this is unequivocally the best movie of the decade i saw it twice
