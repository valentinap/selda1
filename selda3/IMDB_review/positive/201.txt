this movie is the best movie in batman trilogy.its a wonderful acting by christian bale and heath ledger.according to me heath ledger was the most appropriate for the role of joker.but it is very sad to tell that heath ledger is no more among us. movie is full of thrill and bruce wayne with many more gadgets.bale as usual has given us an another wonderful movie.the best part of the movie is that it keeps you enrolled. bales seriousnessmichael caines advisesmorgan freemans humor and jokers dialogues keeps you free of boredom. this is must watch for bales and waynes fans. this movie is not just 1 time watch and whoever do not love batman i would surely ensure that after watching this movie they would forget that they once hated batman. on the whole this movie is just awesome
