im a big stephen king fan and i wondered if this movie would be a good adaptation. some of kings work has been great on film but others have not translated well. no fear. as others have noted this is an amazing film that provides inspiration and reconnects the viewer with the inner core of humanity. the script is great the directing is wonderful and the performances are unbelievably good. to give you some idea of just how good this is the first time i saw it was on an airline. problem was the headset didnt work and there werent any other headsets. the movie is so good that i couldnt stop watching it--and this is a movie heavy on dialogue. if youve never seen it do yourself a favor. note: its even better with the sound
