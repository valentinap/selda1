this movie despite the fact that i have now seen it more than 20 times never gets old and certainly never fails to impress the actors show just how talented they are and how much they are capable of the scenes might seem to not make sense in the order they are in during the first time you watch it but i assure you that after a second or maybe even third time everything will fall into place and amaze you this movie basically has no flaws and demonstrates how amazing the art of cinematography can be many people underestimate the skill and class it takes to create such a movie but it is blindingly obvious that this film belongs in the top 100 best movies of all time in everyones mind this is my opinion on the film it might seem overrated to you because i am a huge quentin tarantino fan but this movie left my mouth wide open and i cannot do otherwise but recommend it
