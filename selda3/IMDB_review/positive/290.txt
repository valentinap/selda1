this is one of or maybe the best movie of the century it is so unique when it comes to jumping from different places to different times no other director than quentin tarantino could have made this movie so special just take a look at lets say reservoir dogs here he use the same teqnique but in a totally different way he is very aware of his one directing tarantino and he seems like a very intelligent person therefore i say that pulp fiction is a movie that indeed deserves 10 stars
