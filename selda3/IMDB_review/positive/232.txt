this movie hit it right out of the ball park for me reading all of these negative and cynical reviews has me stumped i thought this film was way better than i expected it to be even my dad who is quite a tough movie critic thoroughly enjoyed it although everyone is entitled to their opinion to me this movie is one i could watch over and over again and i highly recommend it its perfectly written and the acting is right up there along side the amazing script the movie flows together youre never wondering whats going on or have to worry about getting confused because its so detailed and thorough not to mention ben affleck serves as a nice piece of eye candy through out the film  for those of you second guessing watching this movie because of the many debbie downer reviews on here just give it a chance and come up with your own opinion of this film
