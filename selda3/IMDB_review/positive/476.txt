the dark night is amazing. i have seen it three times already and i am going to see it again. i didnt like batman begins. i thought that the action was to fast and it cut away to much. this film still does that but it is easier to tell what is going on. the acting is great. christian bale is the best batman yet.every time i think of alfred i now see micheal caine. the real star of the show is heath ledger as the joker. he is creepy psychotic and funny in a very twisted way. 2 1/2 hours may seem long but it flies by. this is the best film i have seen so far this year.
