in my humble opinion the greatest comic book film ever made. to start heath ledger made the film. his performance as the joker was one of the greatest performances ever given which is made even more amazing by the fact that just by looking at him or the films he has done where he is the pretty hero you would never see him as this iconic villain. he got the right balance of creepy psychopathic and at times funny making it the best performance of the joker in history. it was a shame when he passed and that he never received the oscar himself that he most definitely deserved but at least he as a man who took pride in his work left behind a performance and a legacy that many actors could only dream of. aaron eckhart was awesome as harvey dent/two-face as well. the turn from being the white knight cop to the murdering two-face was not an easy one to do and i dont think many actors would have got it right but eckhart did and was very convincing as dent. the returning cast bale caine freeman oldman etc. where fantastic particularly bale who had to take on a new stage in batmans life where he is now an established protector of gotham but now must put his own codes and rules when facing his greatest foe. the music was awesome and hans zimmer as well as his team have really gone out of their way to create a batman theme that i believe is as iconic as john williams superman theme. christopher nolan redeemed the batman franchise with batman begins and took it to new heights with this masterpiece the dark knight you will all just have to wait and see where the franchise ended with the final chapter the dark knight rises. the dark knight is not only the best film in nolans batman franchise but also the best comic book based film ever.  not just for characters in a movie but for a better life and a better world for all of us. 10/10
