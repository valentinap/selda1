its always refreshing to see the backstory of how evil develops in past days it was too easy to show the simplistic snidely whiplash versions of villains twirling their handlebar mustaches its even better when the villains redeems themselves and the cherry on top is when a 53 old moviegoer can enjoy the same film among a theatre full of children albeit the crying babies note to parents dont rule out giving your bundles of joy just a very tiny bit of nighttime tylenol about an hour before the movie starts theyre too young to remember being there anyway and everyone else doesnt have to hear their screeching thanks in the tradition of those writers who helped bring to the screen the latest versions of darth vader dr baltar and mila kuniss witch theodora theyve shown very effectively the complicated layers of how evil develops from otherwise good souls such is the case in this departure from the original sleeping beauty reimagining angelinas winged maleficent starts as a loving but aggressive protector of her home but like two of the above mentioned characters betrayal and heartbreak provide the catalyst of transformation from peace and love to revenge and hate then to vindicate the audience from having any misplaced empathy is the redemption the catalyst for this is the love between maleficent and aurora played by elle fanning who adopts her as her fairy god mother this is quite a departure from the animated version i saw some 43 years ago which was 12 years after its 1959 release and angelinas version of maleficent is equally as different from eleanor audleys voiced version not to disparage the original i like this story retold much better i can remember not being that impressed at 10 as i am by this latest version other moral lessons such as the effects of greed ambition fear etc are well taught without the unnecessarily preachy exposition to me this makes a film experience that can be enjoyed by children and adults alike this is one the better efforts put forth by disney lets hope the tradition continues with the upcoming star wars features too bad walt didnt live to see cgi and the latest talent lastly im hearing these rumors about this movie being angelinas big comeback? hmm i never knew she was gone then im always rewatching gia and tomb raider in between her projects
