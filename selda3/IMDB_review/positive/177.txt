this movie was totally magnificent. peter jackson really shown 3 things he has created a saga as good maybe even better than star wars it has shown that it is way superior than the books and he has shown one of the best movies of all time. this movie won everything it was nominated for eleven and really deserved it. this movie was the only fantasy to ever win best picture and the third to win 11 oscars. this movie has brilliant effects acting and anything else you can want from a film. the hobbits acted way better than the second one this did have and ending and it was the best of the saga. it is all i can say and let me rephrase it i am a strict critic and this movie has shown one of the best achievements ever. it is totally over-the-top recommended.
