it is one of the best movies ive watched as a great admirer of angelina jolie i confess i was watching the movie just because of her but i liked everything the story we all already know totally changed its like if who told the story had never thought like the wicked witchwicked witch who no longer deserves to be called in this way the way what the film shows that true love neednt be between a man and a woman maleficent was the mother that aurora had not even after all the disappointments maleficent shows his good side that had never died was just hiddenno matter what you think about fairy tales you need to watch this film because you will not see anything like this for a long time
