this movie and the whole trilogy deserves all the praise it has received. i had been worried about seeing it because of how much peter jackson re-wrote two towers and presented scenes that undermined some of tolkiens fundamental ideas. this time jackson followed tolkien more closely and the worst that can be claimed are sins of omission. its a real shame we didnt get to see christopher lee in this move
