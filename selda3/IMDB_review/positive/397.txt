the shawshank redemption is a movie that creates a sense of mystery and power. tim robbins and morgan freeman carry the movie by displaying their roles as best friends. after watching that movie for the first time i remembered clips that are drilled into my mind forever. it is beautifully written and directed. the scene that sticks out to me is at the end of the movie when andy dufresne and ellis boyd red redding reunite at the end of the movie. this promotes the aspect of friendship that will live on forever. even though these two men have lived in prison for years they eventually got out well andy escaped and they still managed to find one of the most important things in their lives each other. i recommend this movie to all ages. although this movie may be a complex the first time you watch it but after several other times it still creates a sense of thrill and hope for the viewers. 10 out of 10
