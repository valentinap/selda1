in my top ten list this resides happily at #2. christopher nolan is known for giving the batman films new life with his amazing first film. with the sequel he blew me and everybody else away with a good story amazing action and top notch performances by all. i consider the opening bank heist car chase and the conversation between batman and joker to be three of the best scenes ever made in history. i will not be saying anything new when i mention the scale of heath ledgers performance as the joker. many will say that nicholson was the best. while i do admire nicholson i personally think that heaths performance was nowhere in the same ballpark as nicholsons. this is a batman masterpiece and nolan def. knows how to please an audience. i have never heard the kind of applause that i heard after the movie ended when i saw it. everyone cheered because it was just so great. the dark knight can never be duplicated. while it is sad that this role led to ledgers death he left in the highest point of his life. i couldnt be more proud of him. a lot and i mean a lot of people complain about the batman voice. i liked the voice that christian did. the most important factor of batman is that he be distinctly different than bruce wayne. in the past the other batmans have had relatively the same voice as bruce wayne. in this film the voice is strong and aggressive. there were two occasions that i didnt understand him but after watching multiple times i figured it out. after watching the movie i did have a few minor gripes like a wish the fight between the two had been better and that they had put two face in the next movie instead of him being in for the last half hour but i got over it and dont care anymore because the fact is that this movie is just down right f**king awesome and should not be missed by any fan of batman.
