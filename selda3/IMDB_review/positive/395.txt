the shawshank redemption is a story of life itself. it is not about a person in prison it is about the soul and the battle it accepts and carries on to deserve the life it has been given by god. i watched the movie for the first time some months ago. that evening i was about to go out with some friends but out meeting was canceled and i had to stay home. being unhappy about that i started watching the movie on the tv just by chance not knowing about its existence before that at all. at first i was skeptic i admit that. but oh god at the end of it i was screaming and jumping in my room at 1 am it gave me so much emotions and so much hope i had never felt before that. i could hardly believe that a movie could make me feel that way - so excited so happy about my life leaving me believing so much in my own self. it is a great story of what the strength of your thoughts can make you do. in the shawshank redemption desire does not make you weak just the opposite - gives you wings to fly away from fear fly closer and closer to freedom. morgan freemans voice is just another advantage that makes the movie even more impressive. tim robbins act is just beyond perfection i bought the dvd this summer and every time i feel weak or just bad about something i watch the movie. it has become my personal shrink making me feel strong enough anytime i watch it. can never imagine a better movie made anywhere in the world even after 1000 years
