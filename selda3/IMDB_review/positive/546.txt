some scenes that totally worth it to watch this movie over and over. the scene of the blood with the h when mia is od when travolta and mia are talking about a relationship and then started to dance it is just amazing how quentin tarantino could reach that level of movie one of the biggest movies of all times with i think reservoir dogs. i could recommend this film to almost everybody and i think everyone could fall in love with this movie. in the other hand the soundtrack is amazing i love it all especially those sad songs like lonesome town if love was a red dress. and the way the actors get into the character is very cool
