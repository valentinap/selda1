there is no doubt that this film breaks through as one of the best film adaptations of a comic book. christopher nolan has taken the world of batman and turned into real life creating a sense that how would the world of batman look and feel if it was in our world. right from the start in the opening scene shot in imax displaying a deep detailed view of gotham you immediately become immersed in this film. as the film progresses you get drawn more and more into the film it starts to seem less fantasy and has a realness to it mirroring our real world. when casting of heath ledger as the joker was released many people could not see him being this iconic villain heath was sweet nice and had that gentleman quality to him that you see in his other films. when you first see him in the opening bank robbery scene when he takes his mask off you right away see that this was a new joker that was not seen before with scars and messy make-up and messy hair. it has a sense of psychotic craziness with a hint of master mind that is unpredictable in nature but completely thought out in detail. in the later scenes you see the joker only wants one thing and that is chaos to watch the world burn. he kills a few people without even passing a glance at them but can not find himself to kill the batman it plays out as a yin-yang. batman showing that the world is full of people ready to believe in good but the joker shows how even the best can be broken down. you dont realize it is heath behind the make-up and character you immerse yourself into thinking that is the joker. the story has a mix of high action parts as well as slower parts bouncing back and forth creating a dynamic range that isnt to much or to little but keeps your attention through out. it is a true master piece that is a must to watch whether you are a die hard batman fan or not it is a great movie through out.
