i think this movie is great special but not for the story or the characters some people thought its a biography or an emotional movie  well this movie is not so they came disappointed talking about how this movie is boring if you want to see a sweet movie that you can enjoy and go on you will hate this movie richard linklater didt take 12 years to make movies like the fault in our stars he have something to say about the meaning of life real life not fake one and how people deal with it so this movie about the philosophy of life you see people growing up in 12 years they are normal people so you suppose to think about your childhood there are some keys in the script to catch the idea before the end mom patricia arquette looks back and discovers that her life came to end her two child left the house and now she is lonely in a small flat she cries and says i thought it would be more people who hate this movie thought that would be more in a 12 years making movie but in the real life nothing actually happens you just grow up fast and you never seize the moment at the last scene mason meets a girl in his first day of collage she told him that people say seize the moment are wrong  i am thinking its the other way around you know like the moment seizes us mason agreed with this every one who love this movie will catch this  it is the mean massage of the movie dont regret about your sh*t life because the moment it is just  it is like its always right now now you suppose to understand this movie if you say its waste of time and nothing is happen well go and watch twilight saga i bet that is your favorite type if you get the idea of this movie you keep watching it more and more and every time you will remember your life there is a waste of time to search a meaning for how many years or what success you achieved or not because in real life there nothing happens except living  you live each moment and each moment seizes you while you are looking to seize the moment
