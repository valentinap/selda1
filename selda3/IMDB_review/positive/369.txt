the third installment of tolkeins masterful trilogy explodes to life on screen in rotk. from the intro flashback scene to our final farewells i was literally on the edge of my seat. this film is like a rollercoaster ride at mach 1. my only small complaint is that i could have gone for an extra 10 or 15 minutes worth of legolas and gimli they felt slightly underused. all in all one of my favorite movies of all time
