so the movie was shot in 12 years thats hell of a record and its the first thing that makes this movie special the actors and actresses are actually growing up on scene the movie is a slow and soft piece of music with really no climax and all but every moment of it can be enjoyed profoundly there are lots of rooms for deep life lessons that you can absorb from the life of a young artistic kinda weird boy and everyone around him it feels like human kind is still on the way of figuring out the meaning of life this movie wont answer the question you can never answer the question but somewhere in this movie hidden around the corners you see the slightest clues of what life means what you want to do with it how to know who you want to be i wouldnt be surprised if this movie gets the oscar in 2 weeks despite many bad ratings going on around it its a movie that takes patience and experience to truly understand and feel for
