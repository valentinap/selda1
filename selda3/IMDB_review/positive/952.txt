i went into this film with high hopes i was not disappointed the cast was spot on coming from an old reader of the comic series they introduced the kree to the marvel comics universe finally and every single one of the actors cast as the guardians was spot on i am a casual fan of professional wrestling and i am not a fan of dave bautista i understand that most professional wrestlers are excellent actors but didnt expect much of bautista as drax the destroyer instead bautista acted out his role to perfection as did every one else in the film i honestly wasnt expecting much from rocket raccoon considering hes entirely cgi or groot instead rocket was voiced to perfection and amusing and groot stole the show there was a great mixture of emotion action and campy humor to make this film an icon in the marvel cinematic repertoire the cheesy 70s and 80s soundtrack made the film so much better for which i commend director james gunn
