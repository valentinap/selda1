straight to the pointhonestly ive seen a great number of films and very few have reached out to me the characters the film making the drugs the banter between the characters everything in between has all become one and the same under quentin tarantinos directing ive always been intrigued by samuel l jacksons portrayal of jules winnfield a self proclaimed gangsterrighteous man shepherd and more specifically what makes me interested in this character is that he sees himself as a cleanser of the bad guys his quoting of ezekiel a biblical passage of epic proportions fits in well with this righteous character and only pulls me in further in this film this is my review of one character specifically but a review none the less
