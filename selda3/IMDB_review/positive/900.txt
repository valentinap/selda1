im not going to explain the plot of this film. there is a plot but it doesnt matter. pulp fiction is a film with as much style as any film ive ever seen. the acting is fantastic career best for all. travolta is hilarious as vincent a dopey gangster. he just got back from amsterdam where they call a quarter pounder with cheese a royale with cheese. vincents partner is jules played by samuel l. jackson. jackson is hands down the best part of this film. hes charismatic quotable and unforgettable in his portrayal of jules. uma thurman also brings depth and charisma to a seemingly insignificant character. bruce willis is the best hes been also. admittedly i believe the script is so good it makes the performances seem better than they actually are. the music in the film is perfect very energetic. the visual style is gorgeous some of the best editing in any film ive seen. the cinematography is all so arresting. pulp fiction is noted for its nonlinear storytelling but its unfortunately also noted for some horrible ripoffs by no talent hacks. fun fact: tarantino always borrows from obscure movies he loves but he always makes the homages simple and insignificant to the story and characters.
