the dark knight in my regard had been the best directorial impression of christopher nolan in the past and probably will always be . the movie has a script beautifully knit with an amazing background  by hans himmler. unlike its prequel the dark knight does not engage the audiences with an antagonist who focuses on destruction and who loves his own selfishness to make others suffer. instead the joker who is believed to be a lunatic hinted in the batman begins has more rights to be called the protagonist. i write with an assurance that his role has the highest credibility to vouch for than anyone else in the movie. his persona as the joker suits incredibly fit to what nolan wants to capture the audience with and i am sure we all fall prey to it. there are turns and twists in the script rendering the audiences with ample surprises and bolstering action sequences and a decent merge with a breath taking climax. the movie as i have noticed after my 37 watches doesnt allow you to take your mind off at any instant and always engrosses you with your highest expectations. nonetheless your expectations will always be fulfilled to the fullest. a wonderful script and well nevertheless immaculately directed.
