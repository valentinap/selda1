im so glad peter jackson adapted these brilliant books from jrr tolkien... a world in which we can escape as spectator and as actor too... thank you mr jackson  we can travel in middle earth through the beautiful work of the whole crew and those oscars were widely deserved. the hobbit trilogy is different but i trust peter jackson to finish it with wits and through the whole experience of those ten last years. im waiting to see there and back again though cause the end wont be easy to adapt. hopefully it should blow everyones mind  a mellon hobbit in modern times.
