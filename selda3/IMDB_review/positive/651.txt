peter jackson in his artistic is able to created the single greatest masterpiece of a movie that i have ever witnessed.everything about this movie staggered my imagination. the actors mckellen mortenson wood aston etc. are able to portray their respective characters that tolkein described to perfection. furthermore the directing sound costumes and effects all combined with each other to create an unprecedented masterpiece. only two movies shawshank redemption and forrest gump in my mind compete with the genius of the return of king. what separates lotr from other films though is its success in converting a fantasy into not only a mainstream smash but an eleven oscar-winning film. for these reasons i immensely enjoyed this truly unique epic.
