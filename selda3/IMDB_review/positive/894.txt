im robbins plays andy dufresne a city banker wrongfully convicted of murdering his wife and her lover. he is sent to shawshank prison in 1947 and receives a double life sentence for the crime. andy forms an unlikely friendship with red morgan freeman the man who knows how to get things. andy faces many trials in prison but forms an alliance with the wardens because he is able to use his banking experience to help the corrupt officials amass personal fortunes. the story unfolds.... i was so impressed with how every single subplot was given a great deal of respect and attention from the director. the acting was world-class. i have never seen tim robbins act as well since morgan freeman maybe e.g. seven. the twists were unexpected an although this film had a familiar feel it wasnt even slightly pretentious or clich’©d it was original. the cinematography was grand and expressive. it gave a real impression of the sheer magnitude of this daunting prison.
