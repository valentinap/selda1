when someone tells me words cannot express i typically laugh at the absurdity as a writer i conceitedly believe that there are always words for everything however i must bow to this clich_ words cannot express what i think of richard linklaters boyhood given that its been a little over 12 hours since i saw the film and im still speechless i ask you to bear with me in this review i will monologue to state that boyhood is the best film of a year thats not but _ of the way through is a stretch but i find myself limber in this instance boyhood is the best film of the year now time to stretch some more boyhood is the best film of the decade still limber no stretching needed this movie is that incredible it all began with an innovative idea from the already innovative richard linklater what if we see a family grow and age through the eyes of a child? and what if we shot it in realtime? from there a spark was ignited and eventually came to a glorious flame we do see a family age for 12 years this idea is already a selling point for the film but then throw in mr linklaters usual touch of heart and authenticity and youll have something undeniably special youll have an intimate epic a film that is so large in a technical scale and equally large in emotional sale is something hardly seen especially in the past 12 years so when boyhood premiered at the sundance film festival there was a lot hype and this excitement hasnt expired after several months instead it has grown it has traveled through america crafting an astute reputation for the film to follow so for filmgoers like myself who live in small unartistic towns find ourselves overwhelmed with praise for a film we must wait for and we did i personally waited a full monthandahalf for this film to hit el paso but 6 weeks is nothing compared to 12 years so i shall cease my complaining instead i shall say this boyhoods reputation precedes itself as the film opens were are introduced to mason the central character the boy in boyhood he is six years old and the year is 2002 this is when we begin our 12 year journey with him at the end of the school day mason is picked up by his mother olivia an electric patricia arquette early on in the film we get a sense of the living conditions of olivia but instead of shifting the narrative towards her we stick with mason and remain oblivious to the full condition of olivias life in many instances there is nothing heard or seen that mason isnt hearing or seeing if his parents are fighting in the next room we dont see it because mason doesnt see it after a few minutes mason spends time with his father ethan hawke at his finest mason sr is just what youd expect hes your typical absentee dad one who only shows up with gifts and fun but never seems to be serious about raising a family however since we see things as mason does this dad is awesome and greatly missed at this point the plot becomes clear this is a film about a broken family to scrutinize the plot would be to write an 1115 page review there is so much going on within each year of the film that the 12 year story is impossible to break down into a simple synopsis after the first 1215 minutes of the movie the film cuts to a new year 2003 and we find the characters have moved on from the last this process is continued throughout the entire film till we reach adulthood in 2013 and with this formula a masterpiece is crafted there is something so psychologically groundbreaking about this film never before has a film been so relatable so memorable and so poignant as each year appears on the screen we the audience subconsciously immerse ourselves into the same time period we recall what we thought and did in that year and find ourselves nostalgic this feeling is especially effective for members of masons generation like myself we recall the same thought patters and experiences mason goes through as we went through them with this intimacy we find ourselves reliving our childhood this beautiful feeling is something no other film has caused this is why boyhood is so groundbreaking because it is able to captivate its audience and allow us to have a relationship with it what mr linklater has done is not only craft a work of art but allow the audience to view the crafting of the work of art brick by brick line by line side by side for anybody involved in this film whether it be the filmmakers or the audience members there is an intimate oneonone feeling that transcends both time and reality and for that we are indebted to the filmmakers being masons age myself i find boyhood to be a very special film that is incredibly close to my heart as i sat in the theater watching mason head off to college i suddenly realized that that was me i too had just transitioned into adulthood and started a new chapter in my life epic in both a technical and an emotional scope boyhood defines a generation by allowing the audience to go on their own intimate journey with the characters though the film is a rough 3 hours long you feel as if it lasts the whole 12 years simply because you are reliving the period yourself boyhood is the type of movie you dont want to end because there is something so deep in the connection it made with you this i can say with no reservation boyhood is one of the most unique personal and authentic films i have ever encountered
