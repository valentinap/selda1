ten thumbs up if i had them. incredible story incredible cast. i would rate this as probably the best film i have ever seen and i have probably seen it a hundred times on cable. i would have to say this would be morgan freemans best performance out of all of his films. there should have been an oscar for him. this film definitely beat out million dollar baby for which he ultimately and finally received his first oscar. the academy wasnt all there when shawshank deserved its due. robbins played a great part in this film and did an excellent job however freeman carried the film. a true drama that shows the bond of two people in horrible circumstances. yes this one is one to own if you dont have it...buy it. you wont be disappointed.
