this is such a good movie that even to this day many years after it came out i still cannot find a single person who does not like shawshank redemption. everything in this film is timed well. the story is excellent and flows with perfect timing and the editing between the sequences are great. the acting is great and it keeps you interested from the first to the last frame. it also has a very clever plot. you are not 100% sure what tim robbins is up to and how he has escaped until much later. great job by everyone from director actors to script. just the best in movie making.
