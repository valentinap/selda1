probably the best movie in the series the hobbit and lotr this movie is the best because of three crucial parts.first the stunning cgi only a genius like peter jackson could create along with weta workshop.the cgi will make you feel like the orcs are standing right in front of you.second up on the list is amazing writing.with dialog that makes it seem like real life instead of a moviewith most of the dialog coming from the books too.the finally thing that makes this movie great is the soundtrack.often put down as one of the best soundtracks everthe sad violin theme for rohan the iconic gondorian theme and even the mordor theme are good.and you cant deny it you probably cried towards the end of the movie.yes maybe the ending is a little over the top and gimli really isnt that cool and serves as comic relief but otherwise this movie is flawless.
