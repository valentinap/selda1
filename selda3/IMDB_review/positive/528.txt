tarantinos pulp fiction was an amazing film the movie is full of colorful characters electric dialogue and so well casted every time you watch it it gets better and better each scene in this movie is so well thought out you will like it every time i would definitely recommend this movie to anybody its one of my favorite movies you can watch it over and over again and it will be great every time the movie is long but entertaining about 2 hours but its definitely worth watching however the film is filled with swearing and lots of violence so i wouldnt recommend the film to kids some of my favorite scenes in the movie is the ezekiel 25:17 scene the restaurant robbing scene the jackrabbit slims dancing scene and many more if you still have doubts about pulp fiction then you should watch it anyway you might like it  the french new wave or blaxploitation the wild bunch or the brady bunch its all grist
