i totally adored the concept of hope in this film. i love how the director portrays the shawshank tyrants as corrupt murderers thats pretty much what they are and serve as the grounds for the escape of andy. now morgan freemans got talent i love that guy he may not be the greatest out there but he is a force to be reckoned with on the set. i loved how he gave the story flavor with his descriptions of characters and perceptions of how life was in lonely jail cells of shawshank. you know theres a lot more to say about this movie its too good too be true. especially the ending which by the way brought tears to eyes the most moving scene overall it was superb and all thanks to stephen king for putting this in the form of alphabets in the first place. im starting to regret not reading any of his novels. and kudos to the director for even coming up with such an idea for a movie.
