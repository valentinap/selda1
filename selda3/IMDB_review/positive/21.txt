wow what a film this baby is and yes this film is one of the most brilliant films ever written by man and i for one was literally stoked from the start so as a future film maker i hope to one day make a film like this because if i do i will definitely die a happier man. the film was just awesome in every sense and i really loved the plot it had some great cliff hangers and great and classic scenes where the main character became himself more and you just fell in love with him so on that basis i would class this film as one of the all time greats and if you havent seen it yet go out and buy it because you wont be disappointed at all believe you me.
