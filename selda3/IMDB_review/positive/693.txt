ok. so 4 hrs after all the adds and the previews... without a bathroom break break was really long. and yes it was hot and crowded. yes the lineup was an hour and 30 mins long and yes my butt was really really sore. it was all worth it. what was started 3 years ago is over. finally no. im going to miss the excitement of seeing what comes next even through i already knew the bottom line is that this was a great finale to one of the greatest epics of our time. go out. see it with your kids. introduce them to movie making the way it should always be. enjoy. 10/10
