this film is sweeping and epic yet never manages to lose its human touch. it has a message for each and every one of us and is as varied and personal as the many faces of middle earth. if you take nothing from this film other than this you will be the richer: this is an important a vital film because it has something to teach everyone and we are all the better for it.
