i will say that being a big fan of the animated fan i will say that the film did a rather decent job being faithful of the material but adding a few twists and spins of its own in this version it expands more upon cinderellas family family and having a chance encounter with the prince when cinderellas mother and father pass away she is left under the cruelty of lady tremaine played wonderfully by cate blanchett who makes the character rather cruel but somewhat sympathetic who wants to keep the money to her and her sleazy but dimwitted daughters anatasia and druzilla another surprise is helena bonaham carter who looks stunning as the fairy godmother lily james version of cinderella retains the kindness and strong will but manages to have a bit more backbone and courage richard madden does a decent job making the prince likable who loves cinderella for who she is overall i would say overall a great film for those of all ages
