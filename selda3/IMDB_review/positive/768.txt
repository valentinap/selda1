like i did a few years back you might be hesitating about watching this film. the title didnt appeal to me and neither did the subject matter so it was only by chance that i started to watch it. i can only say that the film was a revelation for me and has stayed with me ever since. there are so many dark and hopeless films out there which whilst they leave an impression leave the wrong one i.e that there is no hope in life. watch this film and be uplifted and be encouraged by the message...that there is always hope....in any situation. please watch this film and the watch it again. its a great answer to all the cynicism that is out there.
