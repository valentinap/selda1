its really good. every single thing about this movie is cool. its my number one favourite movie of all time.  well actually the entire trilogy together is my favourite number one movie of all time.  theres no swearing or nudity. i still dont recommend it for the younger audience because there are some slightly frightening scenes though. but anybody over eleven shouldnt be bothered. i dont recommend it for arachnophobia because it might give them a heart attack. anyways this movie has an excellent beginning and a wonderful ending. and everything in the middle is great too. by all means rent it but make sure you watch the two first movies first.
