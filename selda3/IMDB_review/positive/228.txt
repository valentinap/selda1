this movie is a total proof that christopher nolan is actually a very forward director he claims the batman franchise with a very unique and dark film about the most prolific hero of dc. and its not just about the direction of nolan what makes this movie one of the best of all the times there are the stunning casting. heath ledger show us with that clever performance how to reinvent a character as the joker which is one of the best villains ever made and he just add another element and history to him. also christian bale performance is a highlight for me is the best batman of all just because of the darkness in the voice and the capacity to show us the two parts of bruce wayne. im not surprised that this film is in top 10 of the best films ever made because it captures all the single parts of an amazing film.
