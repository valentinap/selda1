it seems that pulp fiction is one of the most discussed films on the imdb and the opinions seem to be split totally 50/50 like with almost every other tarantino pic out there but whether you like it or not whether you hate it or love or whether your a big qt fan or just hate the guy you have to admit that no film is more 100% sure on becoming a classic later on in fact this great rift between movie-goers about this film is one of the things that will make it a timeless classic whether you like it or not personally i think this is one of the 5 best pictures ever made both from a totally critical perspective and also from a more personal point of view since i think that quentin is the best living director/writer in the business so go out and rent the movie and decide for yourself if you aren”ât squeamish you”âll probably love it
