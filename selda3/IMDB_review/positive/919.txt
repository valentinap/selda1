ill always remember watching this film when i was younger it was one of the first films that ever gave me that mind-blowing experience you sometimes get when youve seen a brilliant movie. tim robbins gives what is undoubtedly for me his best performance as andy who is such an inspiring character that you find yourself truly rooting for even in the early stages of the film. morgan freeman gave a stellar performance arguably his best also as red andys cell mate another character you grow to love during this wonderful piece of cinema. this is a film i will never tire of if you havent watched it for whatever reason you should do a solid 10/10 for me enjoy.  pulp is a throwback to those crime cereals that were so prolific in newspapers and comic books of the 70s as well as a throwback to the classic mobster movies many of us grew up with. some people see this as a weakness to quentin tarantinos direction saying that hes limited to only making homages to other things in popular culture. i dont think thats true personally but in my opinion its one of his strengths. he takes a genera that is well known and popular and gives it a very fresh twist. he did that with pulp and he continues to do it today with films like kill bill and inglourious basterds. boiling pulp fiction itself down however the true lovers of cinema the people who will know exactly what tarantino is referencing or paying homage to are the ones who will get the most out of this film. that is however not to say that casual viewers wont like the film. it has a little something for everybody and is without a doubt one of the best films of the recent generation. i hope you like this review and take it into consideration if you decide to see the film.
