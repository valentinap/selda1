this movie is by far the best out of the batman trilogy. i think the joker made the movie with his new darker and scarier theme. dont get me wrong christian bale also did an amazing job but heath ledger made it. it is very sad that heath has passed but this movie will go on in history and i dont know about everyone else but i find this movie one of heath ledgers best movies i have seen. just the fact that he did an amazing job playing the joker and brought the character to life. i think thats what made it so amazing. if heath were still here i think we all wouldve liked to see where his career wouldve went after this role.
