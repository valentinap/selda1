whether real or fiction if a story presents to us an example of loves transformational power it is a story worthy of our attention the reason so many of us do not waste our time learning how to love those who are difficult to love is that such a love requires a great amount of courage on our part first we must be willing to face and embrace every dark aspect of ourselves no matter how large we imagine our imperfections to be no matter how great our sense of shame over our past mistakes may be secondly to love one who is at first difficult to love also requires that we soften ourselves enough to be changed if we go the distance in learning how to love in this way the process will always transform us for the better unfortunately we do not have a lot of examples in our cultures movies books or stories of what such a transformational act of love looks like fortunately disneys film maleficent gives us such an example to all who participated in the production of this film i say well done beautiful story beautiful imagery beautifully acted and beautifully produced i felt my heart was glowing as i left the movie theater
