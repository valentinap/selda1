this movie is a masterpiece on every level all the references to mcdonalds the cereal that was discontinued which quentin has saved and put into the movie it is all a piece of american culture and coming from a guy from europe i simply love all that brand stuff following criminals in their daily lives hearing their dialog - is wonderful and it makes for a lot of wit it is bizarre contrast between murder and funny discussions the acting well i think john travolta was bad even tho he got critical acclaim but samuel give the performance of his life the drugs i like that this movie didnt focus on sex it feels so cheap instead it depicts a housewifes cocaine use classy scenes of injecting top grade heroin it is all very stylish and really makes the movie sexy it didnt feel like a cheap trick it is morbid humor appealing to all of us mainstream moviegoers as well as for respected critics
