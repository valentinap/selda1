like a beautifully crafted french wine this movie keeps getting better and better with every passing year. every time i have viewed it over the past decade and it must be at least more than 20 times by now i have found newer shades subtler indications and deeper meanings. and it has amazed me like very few have. * no overacting * humour in the drab hopeless environs of shawshank * method in the madness of running the scams from inside * the complete secrecy maintained for 20 years not even red knew * the best that a highly-educated intellectual could do inside such a prison * what a great actor the warden turned out to be - totally despicable * what a bunch of speakable quotes.. what a bunch * totally recommended for any young person - students especially * hope truly is the best of things - a message that shines through
