this movie is the third of a trilogy which starts off with the lord of the rings: the fellowship of the ring and then the lord of the rings: the two towers and ended with the lord of the rings: the return of the king which is what i am writing about now and i believe it was the best out of the three. it was intriguing and mysterious which is what i enjoy when watching a movie. it goes for a fair amount of time just like the rest of the movies in the trilogy but it is worth it and you dont get bored unlike what you do in other movies that just go on forever about non-interesting things with no action. if you enjoyed this trilogy of the lord of the rings then i highly recommend you watch the trilogy of the hobbits.
