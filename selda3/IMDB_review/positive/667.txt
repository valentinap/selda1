one of the greatest movies ever made. shawshank tells the story of andy dufresne a banker convicted of his wives and her lovers murder. when andy comes across inmate red the two form a near two decade long relationship. with tim robbins and morgen freeman in lead roles shawshank is an absolute masterpiece that every film lover should watch. frank darabonts directing is great and even more so than any of his previous work. theres really not much wrong with shawshank. the adaptation from stephen kings epic novel is compelling exciting disheartening and inspiring. with great supporting characters an incredible plot and stunning directing shawshank has become one of the greatest movies ever made. its an absolute travesty that this didnt win the oscar for best picture in 1994 although there was some stiff competition.
