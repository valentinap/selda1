when i went to theater expecting something similar to batman begins an average good all around action movie. what i got from the dark knight is a perfect beautiful masterpiece with very little flaws if any. heath ledger is a master at his role. he is the best villain in any movie i have ever seen. it is a shame he died because he is a very good actor. christain bale had another good performance and the rest of the cast had great showings. the plot was great and i have to say that heath ledger is a great great joker and no one can match him. heath ledger is another new edition to the cast and is a good prosecutor. batman learns more about himself fighting joker then he ever imagined.
