this film was absolutely amazing. i have spent hours re-watching various scenes and noticing all the perfection with which they are acted and directed.i like it.i watched this film since 2009.but it is in the my mind still.the acted and special effects are very good. i think orlando bloom is the best actor in the film.because i love archery. i like legolas.he killed two elephants with one arrow.he is very good archer. sarumans army are very strong.the goods is weaker than sarumans army.but goods are win every time.so the goods win the war with aragorns strong. this film very good.really i recommend watch this film to you. this film to do who thanks.
