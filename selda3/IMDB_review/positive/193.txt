this movie proves its worth of having top spot on imdb list.it is not only entertaining but also with a lesson never loose hope as it is the best thing a man can have.great acting displayed by lead actors specially morgan freeman.truly a moving movie with great moral&climax.dialouges of this film are well written. you will miss something if have not watch it. highly recommendable for those who have give up their hope in life. they will find how hope will get best of them.i will say that viewers have truly voted for this film without under influence of big & popular name as it usually happens.like godfather.godfather is nice film but not nice enough to give points above 9 to it.
