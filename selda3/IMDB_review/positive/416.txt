the opening sequence which most people have seen online due to the footage being shown on some trailer reels sets the stage for the entire film. an eerie  brilliant directing and spot on acting. there isnt too much that i feel comfortable saying about this film that hasnt already been said a thousand times and wouldnt give anything away. i will tell you that the joker is incredible. the trailers thankfully dont really give away too much of heath ledgers incredible acting so i recommend seeing it for yourself. a lot of people are complaining about the length of the film but the film covers a lot of ground and shortening it would be murder. go see this while you can its a classic and raises the bar for all super hero films.
