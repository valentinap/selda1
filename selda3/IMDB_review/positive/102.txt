what a narration..one of my all time favorites. shawshank redemption is a very moving story about hope and the power of friendship. the cast is first rate with everyone giving a great performance. tim robbins and morgan freeman carry the movie but bob gunton and clancy brown are perfect as the warden norton and prison guard captain hadley respectively. and james whitmores portrayal of an elderly inmate brooks is moving. the screenplay gives almost every actor at least one or more memorable lines through out the film. as well as a very surprising twist near the end that almost knocked me out of my chair.
