this movie really deserves to be #1 in the top 250. its just so cheerful. if you havent seen it yet first read the book or the whole trilogy then you will understand the movie. yes so i am not gonna tell you any spoilers. but if you read the book or saw the movie congratulations you understood the book and the movie at the same time. if you live in new zealand everyone and you really loves the movie and the book and that is why new zealand is famous because of the lord of the rings. the movie has great roles and characters like frodo baggins gollum sam gandalf the grey. and the movie is declared one of the best movies ever in numerous countries. and that was my review of the lord of the rings: the return of the king.  who are also known for their mesmerizing characters and self-referential dialog. what they get is that qts films are snub-nosed and brilliant with great inventive energy and personal to what qt is all about. like his predecessors who influenced him qt understands that skill and craftsmanship are only half the work and that a passion for sticking to your guns and making strong personal films makes up the bulk of all great hollywood legends. if you want to know what great film making is all about just watch pulp fiction and marvel at its excellence
