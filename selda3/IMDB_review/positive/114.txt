well this film in my opinion is possibly the best ever. this is the end of the lord of the rings trilogy so it is a sad experience at the end but this film is absolutely epically epic. this film leads where the two towers left off with the evil powers gaining strength for the final conclusion against all men while frodosam and gollum head to mordor. everything is ten times bigger in thee stakes and importance as this film really plays up the fact that this trilogy is based throughout a year of these characters life and failure is not an option. every character is better then they were in the last film even the lesser characters of people from rohan and gondor are acted magnificently and really live up to the expectations of this film. there isnt much more to say about this film but see it as it is the most epic master class of film ever with great cinematography action drama and action. a film for the ages.
