probably the most bizarre movie ive seentoo real i stayed focused the whole movie a movie different from the others if you have not seen  do not expect a movie convectional his actors are great great deal samuel l jackson travolta uma thurman bruce willis and others p d tarantino did not really like him but his irreverence breaking the mold in the way we produce is a genius strong real scenes some comedy i do not want to launch any spoiler only recommend as movie icon of the 90s i remember one afternoon i saw by chance among to her no plan to see it the result excellent screen somewhat opaque something retrograde very long so if not for minors disfruntela
