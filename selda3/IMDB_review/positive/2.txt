you only have to watch pulp fiction to get that qt truly understands the meaning of the word: cool qts movies are all about tough guys and centerfold hot chicks who talk about pop culture movies and music but its his sense of language and prose that define his style like raymond chandler or elmore leonard he knows what great dialog sounds like and boy do these characters get a lot of cool things to talk about qts characters are masters at exhibiting great one-liners but theyre also alive with unique quirks and eccentricities mia is hip to knowing the difference between an elvis-man and a beatles-man jules winnfield exhibits a crude rough persona but can recognize a miracle when he sees one butch is a boxer who is as much of a hero as a he is a killer in a movie where the characters are defined by their self-referential discussions and kinetic personalities they are in fact the pulp to the fiction however pulp fiction may also be best known for its splendidly memorable moments that have become a part of popular culture in of themselves think about the dance off in jack rabbit slims its not great dancing but the moment is fun and playful or consider the most quoted scene of the film where jules and vincent talk about big macs theres something visceral and even moving about the films style qt seems to be lamenting his own taste and ideals on worldly topics in fact you can determine what his very soul is driven by at the core of his dialog but its also a film that lends itself to the laymens quality of life where the characters do and say things that relate to what people actually do and talk about and also lets not forget the nature of qts film making no other director has been so eagerly and shamelessly referenced in other films since steven spielberg some of qts best contemporaries are guy ritchie matthew vaughn and james gunn  who are also known for their mesmerizing characters and self-referential dialog what they get is that qts films are snub-nosed and brilliant with great inventive energy and personal to what qt is all about like his predecessors who influenced him qt understands that skill and craftsmanship are only half the work and that a passion for sticking to your guns and making strong personal films makes up the bulk of all great hollywood legends if you want to know what great film making is all about just watch pulp fiction and marvel at its excellence
