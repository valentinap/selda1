nolan has done it again with arguably his best work ever i must say first i am not a comic book reader nor have i ever been. although i like some heroes more than others i am not a very big batman fan either. i just never thought he was that special or a good superhero more like a rich man with armor and guns. while i was never a big fan of batman i am a huge fan of the dark knight this movie was perfect nothing short of perfect. first off i tip my hat to the late heath ledger for his flawless performance of the joker. second christopher nolan has shined once again. i saw this in theaters and when i left i was amazed. not only was the overall movie very well paced and interesting the ending was perfect: batman took the wrap for two-faces crimes so gotham could keep their hero while batman became the enemy. truly incredible. even the music was great..hans zimmer never fails his music was great in inception too also a nolan movie. i didnt think the sequel to batman begins would be as good i was wrong it was 5x better if you want a movie that is serious but also exciting and amazing the dark knight should be at the top of your list. 10/10 truly a great all time movie.
