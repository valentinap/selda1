ive just been to see a preview screening of the dark knight. now im no film reviewer/critic/whatever but this film blew me away. blah blah blah on all the performances they were brilliant heath ledger is a truly psychotic joker as one of his final performances he will be remembered as a villain who thrived on kaos and mayhem. maggie gyllenhall christain bale gary oldman michael caine morgan freeman and aaron erkhart all gave such oomph to their roles. technically the movie was fantastic. with all the explosions you expect and the body count wasnt too high. may be a little too much for children under 13 to grasp. go see it. go on buy your tickets now
