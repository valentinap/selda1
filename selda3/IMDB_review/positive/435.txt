the lord of the rings: the return of the king is the concluding chapter in the lord of the rings trilogy and i must say it concluded amazingly. the movie starts off with a dark backstory of smeagol which when i say dark i mean dark. you see smeagol murder his friend deagol or lover in which you realise how quickly the ring will poison mens minds - even to the point where one would murder a friend to have it. from here you see smeagol deteriorate and become what we know as gollum and its just a really dark segment but it provides a necessary backstory to the character. i must mention that there is one character in this movie that i despise of more than any character i have seen in any movie: denethor boromirs father who pretty much scorns his second born son faramir. its obvious that faramir has been trying to prove his worthiness to his father for some time but when denethor says to his son that he had wished he had died instead of boromir you cant as the viewer help but feel as broken-hearted as faramir. i mean imagine your father said that to you  so gandalf took pippin and rode to minas tirith. meanwhile on the road to the ships that will take elves away from middle earth arwen was thinking over her choice of path. until has a vision of her son that convince her to go home. so she rode home and plead her father to reforge the ancient blade of narsil and give it to her beloved aragorn so he can become the king he was born to be. so overall all three films are excellent. and you know i do feel sorry for faramir being an the unappreciated son i mean it was his big brother boromir who was their dads favorite. i love the developing friendship between merry & eowyn. and i love the end-title song performed by annie lennox.
