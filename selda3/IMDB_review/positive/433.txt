the more times you watch it the more you love it and the more you learn from it. an absolutely encouraging story to those who are desperate or sad or complaining about bad luck. if you never give up and try to figure out a way ahead nothing can stop you to the brightness and freedom. everything you have experienced will bring you positive influences if you take it positively. i have watched it for many times at least ten times i guess. now i hope i can download it and keep it and enjoy it once i have time. i used it to encourage people around me for example a girl friend whos suffering from the depression a workmate who has just lost his favorite pet and a friend who lost his job recently.
