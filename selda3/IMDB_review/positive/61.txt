when shawshank begins for about the first two minutes it seems nothing more than a made-for-tv movie. however as the story progresses you find out how amazing it really is. yet how can a film that contains rape beatings and suicide make you feel so good at the end frank darabont manages to do this so well. the green mile gives you a warm feeling at the ending but not like this does. i just love the way it follows the subplot of brooks right up until he kills himself. how touching that was to see an old man let out of prison but without routine. he belonged in prison not in the outside world. you forget at times that you are watching a movie. it sucks you in and moves you. if you havent seen shawshank you have missed out on one of the finest movies ever made. but dont worry - youre not beyond redemption watch it
