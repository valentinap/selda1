maleficent starring angelina jolie takes a new view on the sleeping beauty story from the life of maleficent the fairy this is much like the musical wicked which tells the story of the wizard of oz from the life of the wicked witch everything about this movie just screamed awesome the special effects the cinematography and the acting were all spot on the magical forest home to maleficent and all of the magical creatures almost the entire forest was computer generated but it looked as real as ever the detail that was put into the creatures of the forest was incredible they didnt cut any corners when making this movie even with the smallest of fairies you could still see every wrinkle every smile and every movement clear as day and watching as maleficent soars across the water and watching it ripple or as she flies through the sky breaking through clouds was nothing less than breath taking everything in this film looked as real as anything ive ever seen the camera angles and lighting were also just as superb everything just seemed natural it didnt like i was even watching a movie more that i was actually experiencing everything that was happening the lighting for the movie was great when it was bright it wasnt too bright and when it was dark it wasnt pitch black but the low light scenes are what really got me in the castle where most of the low lighting scenes took place the amber lights from the torches never clashed with the casting lights and blended right in and when maleficents forest was dark they added soothing yet eerie purple orbs of light all over the place to give the scene an ominous but peaceful feel the acting was as spot on as the rest of the movie angelina jolie was truly born to play the role of maleficent she was sweet and kind but strong and vengeful while still keeping her wisdom and she wasnt the only amazing actor copley played a proud but paranoid king who will stop at nothing to destroy maleficent fanning played an innocent and beautiful if you can get past her blonde hair and brown eyebrows but strong aurora and riley played a obedient yet free spirited diaval the crow even the small actors in this movie did an amazing job this movie is one of the best nonanimated disney movies that i believe has ever been made the acting special effects and the cinematography were just plain incredible you could really tell that the actors and the director put a lot of time into this movie and it couldnt have been any better 1010 for sure
