this is one of my all-time favorite movies the subtle details of this move amaze me every time i watch it my only problem is getting friends to watch the movie that havent seen it during the whole movie i sit there watch this part as they are talking amongst themselves then at the end of the movie it doesnt make sense to them this is a great movie and i thank quentin tarantino for making it the way he did there is nothing about this movie that i would change i just wish i could make everyone sit down and pay close attention so they also could appreciate this movie the way i and all the other voters do thanks
