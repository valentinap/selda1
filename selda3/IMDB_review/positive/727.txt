my favorite of the series ghost protocol 2nd this film s high marks all the way around the story acting and directing all are first class i read that many people who have seen the movie for the first time were confused by the plot so was i but after screening it a second time i was pleasantly surprised at the many subtle nuances to the story there really were its a story that doesnt treat you like a child so many movies directors think they have to go out of there way to spell everything out for the audience scenes that have no other purpose than to drive home an obvious point not this one if i had my way brian de palma would have been involved in the other three de palma was the only one who captured the feel and the look of what i thought the movie should have been if youve only seen it once see it again and enjoy it for the classic that it is
