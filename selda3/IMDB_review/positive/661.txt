outstanding image and sound atmosphere well performed by the lead actors the subject is very carefully constructed it keeps you interested all the time surreal landscapes for scifi lovers i noticed a new technique that attracted my attention loud sounds followed by total sudden silence with exceptional imaging to make you focus on watching the screen undisturbed by other stimuli this way you wont loose the detail that the director wanted you to capture very original for the visual and audio part interstelar is pure art of the scifi genre a priceless gem in an ocean of cinematic junk that overflows in the present very original plot carefully presented and leaving quite a space to interpretation and to meditate upon it as a scifi fan i highly recommend watching this film it will leave you very impressed and satisfied
