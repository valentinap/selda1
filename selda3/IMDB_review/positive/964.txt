i was a little apprehensive to see this movie as i pegged it for a chick flick it was a date night with my girlfriend and usually im bored by these kinds of movies however i was pleasantly surprised at how captivating the movie was i felt the pace in the beginning was a bit slow though and these folks talking about oh i saw the trailer so i knew what was going to happen are idiotic of course youve seen the movie the cinderella story has been around for twice to three times our own lifetimes if not more in many cultures out there *******potential spoilers************ i think the the screenplay actors and actresss casting and the slight differences made this a kids movie for adults we grew up watching these movies as children in some capacity so therefor myself and my girlfriend had a bit of nostalgia while not having to watch a cartoon per say i did say in a joking manner if they dont have the singing mice ill be very disappointed although they didnt exactly have that they defiantly nailed it very tastefully throughout with her creature companions the one thing that does get me about this version is i wish they could have somehow rewritten was the fact her very loving father who only wanted the best for his daughter somehow married an evil stepmother then left her to fend for herself while he was away i know the writing cant always take off down that road as it would be hard to bring it back to the title person in the movie the evil stepmother showed up evil had evil daughters how could cinderellas father not see these people are awful? i feel as though he should have maybe had some similar ties like the prince to potentially be forced to marry the evil stepmother in an attempt to make his fortunes or business stronger in the end the strings i feel are tied up and the movie is brought back to its center stronghold of love kindness and forgiveness
