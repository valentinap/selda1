the dark knight is the quintessential comic book meets realism film. heath ledger and aaron eckhart knock it completely out of the park. every single character shows the most growth/development having to compromise their own personal opinion. it is a non-stop start to finish thrill ride with a detective story woven in. some men just want to see the world burn i just want to watch this movie again and again. gary oldman and maggie gyllenhall really shine in their roles. you wont even notice katie holmes departure. christian bale is still a fairly terrible batman but he makes for a damn good bruce wayne. the final minutes of this film were so powerful that they are still debated despite being put to rest with the opening of the third movie.
