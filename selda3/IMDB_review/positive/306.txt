this is beyond doubt my favourite movie of all-time. i am a morgan freeman fan and apart from driving miss daisy i have loved all his movies that i have seen. the shawshank redemption stands above all. i think it is a great movie with a sad overall story but a happy and just ending. the only other prison movie i like as much is the classic clint eastwood movie escape from alcatraz. the shawshank redemption has long been my favourite movie and even though i have the dvd i still watch when it is on tv. 15 years since its release and i still havent seen anything i like more. i would recommend this movie to everyone and if you havent seen it yet you must be living in a cave or something. if you are in a cave get out and go see this fantastic movie. 10/10
