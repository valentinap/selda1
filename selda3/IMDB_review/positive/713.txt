nolan returns to the helm of what many consider the perfect batman film. bale caine oldman freeman murphy and mcfarlane all reprise their roles spectacularly and flawlessly without upstaging one another nor their performances from begins. holmes is replaced with gyllenhaal who look nothing alike but the story itself is too strong to be setback by a recast. heath ledger portrays the most chaotic and theatrical -- yet most convincing memorable and realistic -- joker to date. the joker is as amusing as he is intimidating and will stop at nothing. ledgers role isnt as pronounced as nicholsons was in the 1989 film which is actually a stronger move because it avoids any upstaging. hans zimmers wonderful muddling  just adds to the jokers prominence. eckhart makes harvey dent his own. nolan succeeds in continuing an absolutely plausible take on a renewed batman series_Ñ_ its almost too real for some people. its conservative undertones can be excused for its moral depth. **** out of four  from the cinematography to the acting the casting the writing...everything. its a fantastic example of the power of hope and the true nature of the human spirit. when you watch it you just know that every scene is classic  so many moments will be remembered forever in film history. if anything it just keep getting better with each time i see it. i will continue to enjoy this film for the rest of my life.
