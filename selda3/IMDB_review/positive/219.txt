this movie is great it has everything in it. fantastic acting by all actors and actresses. the dark knight is darkgrandiose and mad and hugely entertaining. the screenplay is really awesome from the start to the end i love heath ledger as the joker and christian bale as batman every time those come on screen together it gives me goosebumps. i liked batman begins and dark knigt rises to but this is absolutely a master piece from christopher nolan. nolan totally smashed the trilogy from the 90s. for me this is one of the best movies ever made i hope you all enjoy the movie rip heath ledger
