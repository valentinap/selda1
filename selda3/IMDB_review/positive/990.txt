i saw this movie for the first time 8 years ago. i just happened to see it by chance on cable because i never heard about the shawshank redemption before. after watching the movie i was immensely impressed and positively surprised. definitely this is the best movie ive ever seen. the story the direction and the cast specially tim morgan and gil bellows are perfect the shawshank redemption really deserves that spot in the rankings. this movie is a must see the movie not only offers a great viewing experience but also a lesson to take home. wish more movies are made in this fashion instead of the blood and gore that people seem to appreciate nowadays. thanks for reading this review.
