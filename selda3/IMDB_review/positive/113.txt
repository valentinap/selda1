well what can i say but freeman who is simply a great actor a man who has never struck a false note in his career both narrates this tale and anchors it with his authoritative playing. powerful poignant thought-provoking and finally irresistibly uplifting. the shawshank redemption works not only as an excellent prison drama but as a metaphor for overcoming our own private prisons.an amazing movie. easily one of the best movies made during the 90s and definitely one of the top prison movies of all-time. pretty much everything about this movie works and works extremely well i have not read stephen kings novella his first non-horror but some of the movies deficiencies such as the old-fashioned morality tale and portentous message about camaraderie and redemption--must have been in the source material.
