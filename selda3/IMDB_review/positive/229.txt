this movie is a must watch for any and every person no matter the race or gender. the only thing that is not good about this movie is that it has an end. its quite depressing. i have watched this movie at least once a new year and ever road trip. its very entertaining kills time inspiring awesome action scenes and the work on the uruk-hai and the other beasts is incredible. as with the first two the film is very long but goes by without you ever truly realizing it. this film is so much more than a simple fantasy epic. its a story about strength of character friendship loyalty and love. and while every member of the fellowship has their part to play i finally understood why some critics have said this series is a story about sam. its his unwavering resolve that led the quest to its victory. sean astin is a true credit for adding the inspirational heart to this epic. as as far as the ending goes they ended it the way that it had to be ended. jackson ended this film the way it should have been. this is probably the best movie ever made. if there was a rating higher than 10 i would give it. excellent 10/10.
