this review contains spoilers so better see the film and then read my review. sometimes it makes me wonder why this film didnt go well in the box office. shawshank redemption is not just about a story where a man escapes from a jail. it captures the life of people who spend their life in jail. i believe that jail life and free life are almost similar. sometimes we enjoy and sometimes we feel sad whether you live in jail or not. sometimes life doesnt make any sense at all. some people succeed in their lives with ease and some people faces a great deal of hardship and still wont succeed in their life. these people are forced to the point of desperation. what they should know is that all of us have a destiny to reach and the main thing which matters the most is hope which you should need until the moment you die. if you believe in yourself and have hope then one day you will reach your destiny in this life or in your after life.this film has really changed my way of looking the life.
