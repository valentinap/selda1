many went into this film with high expectations and hype that was unprecedented much like the somewhat disappointing godzilla 2014 from earlier this year not many knew what to expect with this film considering that the guardians of the galaxy were for the most part unheard of characters to the general public this film did not disappoint in any way it is by far the greatest marvel film ever made downing the avengers and days of future past i went into this movie with a feeling that i dont usually get with a film i knew that this was going to be different and good at the same given time and i was not let down from the very opening scene to the ending credits there was not even a second of boredom to say that this film was entertaining would be putting it under the bus this film was exhilarating never have i seen a film that grasped my attention and kept me in awe from start to finish as for the technical aspects this film has the best cgi i have ever seen not once did the animation look even relatively fake or cheesy the cgi will probably revolutionize the field much like 2009s avatar i felt as though i could reach out and touch these alien creatures and the amazingly designed ships the  of the film was beautiful as was the cinematography there were emotional scenes that were played so well with the  that it was as if they were interchangeable parts that had to be together to work in unison every shot of this film was gorgeous and breathtaking i saw so many things that i have never seen in a film before and for them to capture it so crisply is truly astounding the acting was very well done by all of the cast members there may not be any oscar buzz for the cast but that doesnt mean that they werent perfect for their roles chris pratt was genius as star lord bautista was hilarious as drax the destroyer and bradley cooper and vin diesel did great jobs for voice acting both being highlights for the film as far as writing this movie did something truly unique it focused on all of the guardians with equal screen time and equal information of their lives though star lord may have a bit more for obvious reasons all of the personalities of the main characters were written so well that i forgot for a period of time that it was even a movie the humor is not dirty for the most part and is not slap stick and tiresome every scene with humor did its job to make the whole crowd in the theater laugh hysterically the dialogue was simply that well written every aspect of this film was great obviously it isnt a perfect film but it manages to do something that directors have forgotten about it entertains the audience and that is the sole purpose of the entire film films now rely so heavily on art and the directors ideas of uniqueness that most films are only appreciated by certain groups guardians of the galaxy is a film that anyone can watch and they will enjoy themselves from start to finish and never want to leave the theater while watching this movie at the opening friday i couldnt help but think to myself over and over again that this is the next star wars it has the same chemistry and formula but in my own opinion it exceeds the original star wars it is an updated and modern form of that film technique of pure entertainment mixed with humor and character development that adults can relate to as well it is rare that i say this but this film will make you cry make you laugh make you excited make you fearful etc it is every genre and yet no genre guardians is going to be a staple in film and will one day be considered one of the greatest sci fi films ever james gunn was the director of one of the worst films of 2013 in movie 43 but he has proved that he is one of the elite despite a horrible effort a year prior this film resurrects the original intention and purpose of film to entertain i believe it will be the next star wars and spawn many more films to come
