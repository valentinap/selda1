what can i say...the only film to make a grown man cry no film comes close to this in any way or formit draws you in from the start-keeps you there and if your like me..turns you to tears at the very last scene.enjoy it because no film will ever be made like this again.  and though i like reservoir dogs more pulp fiction is not too far away of being as great as that. and i must say too that pulp fiction should have won the oscar that year instead of forrest gump.
