if anything pulp fiction is great because like atom egoyan tarantino doesnt see the world as linear watching this movie i really got the idea that other events do occur even if were not involved with them this movie really has a pulse where as most movies just plod along and the plot which seems utterly confusing at first makes perfect sense at the end which was the big problem with the usual suspects where the more i knew the less i cared the film is not as violent as it first seems that has been a major issue in the movie but if you count the body count is only seven or eight and a few of those deaths are implied such as the gimp a real treasure a movie that makes you appreciate what movie experiences are really about
