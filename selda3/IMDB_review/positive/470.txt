the film begins by establishing at his own rhythm its ambitions men overexploited land resources which is why the only goal they have left is to survive this life is not enough for cooper brilliantly played by mcconaughey who gave body and soul to this character but all of this wouldnt hold without the total control of christopher nolan based on the languishing soundtrack by hans zimmer the luminous and impenetrable photography of hoyte van hoytema and the sincerity of nolans directing he manages to film the characters and to find the right cut at the right time always in harmony with hans zimmers soundtrack to give the film an aspiring and inspiring dimension that went missing for many many years thus we are transported into the same cockpit that cooper we feel the same remorse that he can already feel we feel the same gravity and we feel the same fear of the unknown melted with the force of his will all of this is brilliantly illustrated in a very simple directing choice which from my point of view is the decisive impetus of the film to directly jump from when cooper leaves in his truck leaving his family behind him to endurance taking off this simple editing decision allows nolan to give an original movement to his film and the musical crescendo makes us physically feel the sentimental break between two parts of the film you dont necessarily have to understand it immediately  the film will raise questions in you such as  what is it to be a human being is there some physical limitations to our humanity how far could we be willing to go to determine knowledge is there other dimensions that we can not access to and above all what is the nature of this intact and immutable bond that unites us to others wherever we are in the universe ? is this bond only intelligible or is it also tangible ? all these questions resonate in harmony in nolans interstellar interstellar is itself a crescendo increasing sensitivity and creativity i use the term deliberately because it goes crescendo with the soundtrack by hans zimmer which is one of the most beautiful music ever d for a scifi movie we are witnessing a perfect musical arrangement a total symbiosis a bit like the music of gravity which had understood very well how to match the image and the rhythm of a sequence to its own musicality zimmers crescendos are giving a new powerful breath to every new scene whether it is in visually powerful & intense moments or in more intimate moments it intrudes into our momentary feelings and sensations and manages to extend them sometimes almost to choking before resting on the balance of the film frame along with our mind spellbounded i have seen all the talent of the director that i knew he was outside the norm but whom i did not know his capacity to reinvent itself because this is it interstellar is not an action movie not really a blockbuster and it goes not entirely but mostly again the expectations of common people its much more than that this is much more than just a scifi movie it is unlike any of his previous films some hoped to see interstellar as christopher nolans best film and they were disappointed that this was not the case and indeed this is not the best film of christopher nolan because in a way it is his first film im not saying that interstellar is not as good as his other films it goes beyond all of them but to me interstellar is the first film of a new stage in nolans filmography  it is a masterpiece as it the beginning of a work ahead interstellar is the proof that nolan has finally managed despite all the expectations that were placed on him after the success of the dark knight to move away from his own reputation to create a personal work original humble sincere and deeply meticulously measured now in this third act of the film it all comes to life with unparalleled strength nolan poses and answers questions that raise others but he focuses his attention on the great mystery of love that emotional bond that can unite men and sometimes separate them but nolan is the only one that can successfully speak of love from a being to another in a film that mainly takes place in a another galaxy from my point of view only solaris by steven soderbergh 2002 unfortunately neglected by the audience was able to accomplish that interstellar is based on a premise which is the following  from terrestrial dust to the depths of space and time we can never be separated from who we are as individuals and as a species as we always leave a part of ourselves behind us in other words i could say that this is a human story and even if we go as far as we want to if we travel through the universe believing that we can be detached of the one we are fond of we will only get closer to them because the separation and thus the distance and time can only ultimately reinforce the relationship between the people who really love each other because it is going to the end of the world when we reach the end of ourselves that we reach the singularity of the black hole beyond the horizon *  it is our humanity no i wasnt been able to find any bad flaws in the film not one and im still looking after all interstellar is like gravity all it takes is a little push   *youll have to see the movie to figure that one out f_lix tardieu november 1st 2014
