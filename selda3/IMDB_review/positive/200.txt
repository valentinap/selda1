this movie is the best of everything the charaters are the best with each other and their environment. you have to love the pros as well as the antags. this movie as one reviewer once said of this movie it is the best movie of this generation the saddest part it is the last movie. the only thing i have to say that was a downer it needed more epic battles so my top 5 have now changed: 5=scarface4=matrix3=lord of the rings 32=godfather1=citizen kane.
