i would like to start out by addressing something i find totally unfathomable the sheer volume of criticism the film has attracted here on imdb though i cannot say i am completely unsurprised by it after all this site in particular seems to bring out the worst side of people and attracts many of the negative nancys of the internet still its rather disheartening that so many people are being so dismissive of this film over trivial or even objectively incorrect perceptions of its weaknesses gone girl directed by modern cinematic mastermind david fincher is one of the most stirring mindbending and thrilling mysterydramas in years elevated thanks to finchers expert guidance and universally incredible performances from its expansive cast the film is very much the perfect modern thriller delivering enough edgeofyour seat twists to keep you enthralled and still pondering the implications of the film long after its finished ben affleck stars as nick dunne a man whose seemingly perfect marriage has been crumbling for some time culminating in the disappearance of his wife amy rosamund pike the morning of their fifth anniversary nick soon finds himself at the center of an enormous cluster of problems including the growing media circus surrounding the case uneasiness with local authorities who are trying to find amy and his own inconsistent attitude which is painting him in an increasingly suspicious light what happened to amy? is nick truly the loving husband he wants to work to believe he is or is he the sinister sociopath that media wants to paint him as? and most importantly did nick in fact kill his wife? while i cannot give too much away as to avoid spoilers i must say the casting and performances are incredible and absolutely spoton affleck knocks it out of the park as a troubled man who may not be the figure he outwardly tries to portray himself as neil patrick harris and tyler perry make for thrilling supporting roles that take you by surprise especially considering their predominately comedic backgrounds kim dickens gives a great turn as a local officer who is simultaneously one of nicks biggest assets and also one of his biggest detractors and carrie coon shines as nicks sister who serves as his moral support despite not always telling him everything he wants to hear but it is rosamund pike the titular gone girl who shines the brightest this is her film everything about her role is intriguing troubling and keeps the mystery and suspense alive in particular her journal entries which comprise the backbone of the film and also lead the audience to question whether she or her husband had their own ulterior motives in the marriage and warps the perception of the story pike deserves so much more recognition for this role because this is the role of a lifetime writing duties are handled by gillian flynn whom also wrote the novel upon which the film is based while i have not read the book and therefore refuse to compare it flynn constructs a tight concise yet also deliciously mysterious tale and some of her framing devices and artistic flourishes help elevate what could have otherwise been quite the routine film im excited to see what comes next for flynn because this film has definitely made me want to keep my eye on her work in the future director david fincher continues to prove his status as one of the great directors working today with this film as he has with previous works he soaks this film in his deliciously dark twisted sometime nihilistic visual and storytelling sensibilities and it fantastically compliments and augments the uneasiness of the story and the unsure relationship the audience has with the characters and finally there is the remarkable  by trent reznor and atticus ross my god this is one of the most unique and fascinating musical s ive heard in some time ive been increasingly interested in the duos work especially after their last collaboration with fincher on the girl with the dragon tattoo remake which i will admit i think has a slightly superior  and they once again provide the perfect audible backdrop to the visual experience of the film bravo reznor and ross gone girl is easily one of the best films of the year in my opinion its a stellar example of modern mystery and tightly assemble character drama and its a film that will haunt you long after it ends its a perfect 10
