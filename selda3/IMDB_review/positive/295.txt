this is not only a great comic book movie not only a great crime thriller movie but one of the best movies of all time. the best villain in all of dc comics the joker comes to life as he is portrayed by heath ledger who literally gave the performance of his life as he tragically passed away before the films release. bale is fantastic once again as batman returning with that epic voice and giving the fans once of the best movie quotes ever im not wearing hockey pads. the tone for this movie is dark and really gritty and takes nearly all the comic book elements and throws them out the window making this an epic movie for anyone to enjoy not just comic book fans. the soundtrack cinematography and direction for this movie is amazing just go an watch it if you havent already. 10/10
