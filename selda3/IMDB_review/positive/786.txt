ive watched this about 20 times now and im captivated from start to finish every time. its a gripping emotionally draining and exciting film. id go far to say that it is the greatest film of all time. along with the best trilogy of all time. this film set a new standard in film making and jackson is probably the most sort after director going thanks to this movie. you have to really watch the last film as it starts straight after the last one had finished. frodos task is hanging on a knife edge has he starts to lose strength and his trust in gollum grows to strong. andy serkis and weta do an absolutely fantastic job of gollum once again. he looks extremely realistic once again and really plays a big part in the film. i thought the expansive scenery and battles added to the brilliance and build up towards the end. in particular the battle of pelannor fields just left me jaw-dropped at how brilliant it was filmed. some of the huge backdrops played a big part also i.e. the part where gandalf finally sees minis tirith. you feel very involved throughout the film with frodos quest. jackson creates the sense of pity fantastically on the viewer regarding gollum. the only issue i have was jackson did squeeze to many endings together making them feel a lot less emotional on the viewer. i thought it was awfully sad when frodo passed into the west and they should of just left it at that however it was a lot to cram in and i think 3 hours of film was absolutely masterful. its hard to review a film with so many qualities and very few faults. if you look at professional critics they will agree at how good this film is 11 oscars well done and more awards. the most solid 10/10 ive ever given.
