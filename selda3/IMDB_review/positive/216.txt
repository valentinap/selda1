this movie is just the pinnacle of movie-making from the bizarre yet believable situations to the dialogs between characters there is probably no other movie where i enjoy myself more the story is non- linear but the thing is is that it doesnt bother the viewer at all the legendary opening the legendary ending the quotes the soundtrack the performances this might just at well be considered the perfect me to me it is i rarely give a movie 10/10 but pulp fiction is the movie that deserves it because there is no possible way you could improve it on a personal note there is something about this movie that truly makes me nostalgic although it is stuffed with violent and nihilistic themes this movie is like a big goodbye to the good times and an in-your-face times will never bee this cool again
