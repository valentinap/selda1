once again peter jackson proofed that hes one of the best visionary directors of his time. the lord of the rings: the return of the king is yet another masterpiece. frodo and sam tight their bonds so they can together cast the one ring into the mountain of doom. with a lot of pathos action and emotional scenes the lord of the rings: the return of the king combines every feature that movie should have. excellent music from howard shore only suits this movie up - great brasses violins and other string sections will make you cry even after tenth showing. its long. in extended edition it has over 4 hours of watching but believe me you wont even blink an eye. peter jackson doesnt make a mistake like other directors that are basing on books. some moments are mixed like pj wanted but the movie grip strong to the book. in my last words i want to say that the lord of the rings: the return of the king is a must-see position on your watchlist. its an incredible masterpiece that take my breath after almost ten years of watching.
