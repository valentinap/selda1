nolans directing is sublime the pacing of the movie was so well kept managing to keep the audience enthralled in an almost 3 hour movie. there were several shots in the film that had me saying now how in the hell did they do that brilliant s by james newton howard and hans zimmer. every actor shines no one person steals the film. i dont want to say much about it because whatever is said cannot do it justice there is enough hype surrounding its release but its there for a reason. top notch film. bravo to nolan and his crew for giving a movie that batman truly deserves.brilliant s by james newton howard and hans zimmer. every actor shines no one person steals the film. i dont want to say much about it because whatever is said cannot do it justice there is enough hype surrounding its release but its there for a reason. top notch film. bravo to nolan and his crew for giving a movie that batman truly deserves.
