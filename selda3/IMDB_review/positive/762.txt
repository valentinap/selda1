lotr 3 is one of the best movies ever made and all the oscars it got were completely well deserved in fact i would add a couple. viggo mortensen ian mckellen and bernard hill all deserved a best actor nomination. and i would also mention sean bean whos performance of boromir in the first part was completely underrated it was a great performance and i cant believe he wasnt nominated i am usually a big fan of the books. ive noticed that some people complain about peter jackson completely changing the dialog and some scenes. its true. he did do that but i think its actually better this way. dont get me wrong the books are magical. its just that certain scenes and dialog would look and sound dull when seen on movies. peter jackson knew it and he had to make a certain changes. im glad he did visuals are revolutionary for the time and great for today writing is great directing is great acting is great cinematography is great make up is great costimography is great fighting choreography is great... and so on... and so on... all in all this movie is just brilliant one of the best movies ever to be made and definitely the best movie in its genre. deserves all the awards and all the hype it got a true masterpiece
