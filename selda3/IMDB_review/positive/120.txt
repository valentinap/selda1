well i didnt had any high expectations when i watched this movie but damnthis is one hell of a moviethis movie is very well safe in my top 5 favorite movie of all time as far as i remember this is the only movie that i didnt want it to end even when the duration is almost 3 hours this movie maybe didnt have much action or explosion but the dialogues are enough to keep you glued seriously i think that is what hollywood movies are lacking nowadayssuch entertaining and wonderful dialogues/conversation all of the cast did a great job in this movie and i think the one that really stand out is sam jackson and i think you all know why when you watch it and i pretty much enjoy the non- linear plot style that is shown in this movie i feel pity for anyone who still havent watch this movie or anyone who considered this movie as boringi remember when its about to end i was like nooo dont end yetsuch an addicting moviea great masterpiece that will live throughout the ages
