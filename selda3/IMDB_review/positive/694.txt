ok after a very long waiting for the bluray today i watched the movie first of all ill guarantee you that this is a must watch movie for scifi lovers the runtime is long and someone can think this is boring but i must tell you that watch this movie till the end actually i can say that its a journey that you feel to the core all the credits must go for the plot and the best director like all of them said the plot is completely pure also must say that hans zimmer done a fantastic job all over the movie and with a pure plot and nolans directing + hans zimmers music its a high class weapon that can attack you heavily christopher nolan this movie showed us what you can do and its very clear that you made your life immortal
