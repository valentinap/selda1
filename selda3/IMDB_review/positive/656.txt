perfection has to be the best word to describe this terrific movie. it has everything you could ever want including a great story characters direction editing sound music effects acting funny lines settings. i could go on forever with praise talking about how outstanding this movie is and how emotional it was. it has to be the greatest movie ever made. fotr and ttt were both terrific as well but this one has to be the best of all three by far. once i walked out that cinema theatre i was just blown away and knew it was and if you havent seen it yet then let me tell you now. this movie will take your breath away. enjoy now and for many milleniums to come outstanding 1000000000000/10
