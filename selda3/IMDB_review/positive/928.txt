if you havent seen it you might say why does a batman movie have such a high rating let me stop you right there this is not a batman movie. this is a disturbing dark horror-like reinterpretation of batman. you could completely care less about the dark knight character and even forget about him sometimes when heath ledger comes on the screen as the joker. a crazy man who paints his face and carves smiles on his victims with a razor sharp knife. never have i ever been more impressed by any acting performance than this. heath ledger is the scariest creepiest craziest murderous villain in all cinematic history. no offense christian bale but heath ledgerjoker is the reason this is one of the greatest movies of all time. the joker is the reason you see a 9.0 in front of you. he is scary as f***. twisting a childrens comic into a horror movie. i was never into comics superheros especially not batman. this movie blew my mind. you are seriously wasting your time on this planet not watching it. just like you are if youve never seen its always sunny in philadelphia. its like trying apple pie you have to. personally not a big fan of apple pie just used that because its a saying so replace apple pie with something you think is delicious that everyone has to try. then add this movie to your list. if you think you dont want to watch it because you dont like super hero movies you are misled and sadly mistaken.
