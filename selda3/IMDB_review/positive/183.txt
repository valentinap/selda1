this movie was honestly a lot different than i had expected i was expecting more evil on maleficents part however there was more depth in her character and i think the movie did a great job expressing her character in a more complex way it was definitely a lot sadder than i had expected i cant get over how great angelina jolie was as the part of maleficent her expressions were extremely detailed and i was very impressed with her acting i think this movie is a definite yes and i will be back in theaters to watch it again it was a beautiful film and i think many will find that it is much more enjoyable than they had expected i will definitely be recommending this movie to others
