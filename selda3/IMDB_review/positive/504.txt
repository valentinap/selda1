the dark knight is a masterpiece in cinema with a very dark tone. with terms of direction an story telling i found this movie to be interesting because i already saw the batman begins. when i saw the dark knight it was nothing like the tim burton films we saw. it was dark and terrifying. the joker was the reason why i was on the edge of my seat. its the movie that holds the standards to filmmaking. the writing and the direction was great chemistry of essential filmmaking. christopher nolan is amazing architect of story telling and directing. the cast was great. christain bale played a great batman in this role. but the joker was the one stole the show. i would recommend that you buy this movie. its awesome.
