i will keep this short pulp fiction has amazing characters played by fantastic actors like john travolta uma thurman bruce willis christopher walken and of course the most badass man on the planet samuel l jackson this is a movie i compare to snatch and lock stock and two smoking barrels those movies are great but nothing compared to pulp fiction it has a great and entertaining story and is a true classic it is quentin tarantinos best movie and that says a lot it has great action scenes and funny lines some quotes from this movie will i remember for the rest of my life if i summarize it i can say that it is a funny good written good action scenes good quotes and fantastic actors i recommend this highly it is way better than the godfather and the shawshank redemption it deserves to be on top it also deserved to win an oscar although forrest gump was good this is better
