not my favorite film of all time but i think it is probably the last great movie of the decade sure the movie is super cool but it also happens to be fine filmmaking some people cuddle up to brain candy movies like forrest gump because they think a feel good movie is the only kind of emotionally compelling type of film out there there are other emotions to evoke besides sympathy or just plain ol garden variety sob-fest there are also movies which disturb you incite you etc pulp fiction is such a movie besides its got super cool dialogue and an ensemble cast that kicks @$$ everyone is at their best and havent topped those performances since i might add except for travolta in battlefield earth that was supposed to be sarcastic by the way bruce willis proves he can act to the world and very well too some of us already knew it and how can you not like a movie with a scene in which a hit man slams a gigantic needle into the chest of the wife of a mob boss who has overdosed on heroine how can you beat that 10/10 all the way baby
