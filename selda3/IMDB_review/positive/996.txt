i saw it on the opening night in houston tx and it was very much appreciated there was sounds of appreciation during the movie from the viewers and certainly much clapping at the end and sorry this may be a spoiler bit when obamas head exploded all good fun dont take it too seriously however and it was certainly poking fun at britishness and previous films but in a fun way no one i spoke too had a bad word for it it was well paced and kept you involved all the cast were good but samuel l jackson was terrific although a certain resemblance to bond movies it made its own distinctive style i am guessing there will be a follow up
