this is filmmaking at its apex though i would hardly argue that this film is the greatest which is what many imdb users relate after theyve just seen a movie they really like and then forget about once the next titanic or matrix hype machine bursts their way i must say that pulp fiction added more to the cinematic lexicon more than any other film of the 90s and who can argue with that indeed it is one of my favorites just for its adamant refusal to do things by-the-book and many previous comments essay this film as a highly moral and spiritual piece--they couldnt be more right when the film came out a lot of the reviewers commented on its cinematic brand of hipnessbeing hip is cool but i wouldnt necessarily equate that with great movies--just look at men in black which was sorta fun but hardly the endurable piece of cinema that pulp fiction has become so what sets it apart from the rest of the crowd its exactly this spiritualitywatching the film i remember being shocked and enlightened at the same time being unbearably tensed up and utterly charmed and in agreement with this weird california former video clerks world view the film is a tour-de-force of the cinematic style  one of my favorite shots in the film seems to be a homage to both the fast-paced unbreaking style of scorseses goodfellas and roman polanskis rosemarys baby it is the scene where travolta crashes his malibu into eric stoltzs front yard and brings the oded thurman inside his house as rosanna arquette hurls invectives at the two the camera wonderful work by andrez sekula moves back and forth between arquette and travolta and stoltz lurching over thurman thats the scorsese part then as stoltz goes looking for the plunger the camera follows him into a room where it inexplicably stops at the doorway so as to impede a full sight of stoltz reminders of the scene where polanski photographed ruth gordon in rosemarys baby by placing an obstruction between her and the camera so the audience would instinctively lurch their head to the side making a hopeless attempt to see around the obstruction such a phrase can be used to describe pulp fiction: most movies simply unfurl their stories at the audience this movie subliminally makes you a part of the action i recently had a semi-argument with a friend over the worth of this film over natural born killers now dont get me wrong oliver stone is a powerful filmmaker but his film banged you over the head incessantly with points like im going to use my artistic license to satirize the over-the-top violence of popular culture by making a movie replete withover-the-top violence in the style of david spade its called hypocrisy oliver--check into it anyways i digress anybody who bad-mouths this movie indeed has no appreciation for cinema  sure the film may have a goof or an errant philosophy somewhere  but tarantino fulfilled any filmmakers dream in revitalizing cinema you can say that the films tone didnt impress you that its style wasnt to your tastebut you cant deny the artistry that went into it morality for all of those who believe this film is an amoral travesty i suggest you rent the family favorite the santa clause and count how many times disney shamelessly milks its own products or if god is mentioned even once in what is supposed to be a christmas film or in any family film what impressed me the most when i first saw pulp fiction was its inclusion of god at all many generation-x filmmakers paging kevin smith are so agnostic in their beliefs that it was so refreshing to see one that painted divinity in such a positive light you can have those other indie favorites chasing amy and good will huntingboth starring those irritating crybabies matt damon and ben affleck and if you like those cynical films which are basically reworkings of oh-feel-sorry-for-me melodramas of the late-40s reworked with equally irritating alternative rock best summed up by the smashing pumpkins in a simpsons episode: alls we got is our millions of dollars our legions of fans and our youth then you can have them compare that to jules awakening i was just sitting here eating my muffin and drinking my coffee when i had what alcoholics refer to as a moment of clarity and youll see how tarantino turned the mythic gen-x stereotype on its head as well pulp fiction is in my opinion the king of the indies and one of the best examples of cinematic craftsmanship ever
