the above line is from contact the novel by carl sagan and it is the first thing that came to mind as i thought about writing this review. i truly cannot explain the grandeur of the movie or how seamlessly pj has integrated it into the trilogy. this is no doubt the best film trilogy ever. trotk may even be the best movie ever. if not that it certainly deserves a place among the very top of the best movies of all time. while watching the 3 1/4 hour movie for the first time in my life i regretted having read and reread the book just because all the plot twists were known to me but even then i could not help but get gripped by the scene on mount doom and the battle of mins tirith. i think enough synopsis and explanations etc. have been written about the movie so i would not go into that. suffice to say that this is a movie for every age every genere. it has elements of action romance sci fi and some good old good verses evil epic battles. one thing for tolkien lovers -- tolkien was a master of the detail. in the book you can feel the colour of grass the cack on a marble floor and the smell of orcs. this movie is very much like that in detail. i cannot imagine how exaustive a task it must have been for the effects team to create such minute detail in every creek every cliff every suit of armour. all i can say is that tolkien would have been proud. i have heard that christopher tolkien jrrs son is not impressed by this trilogy. all i can say to him is that he should give it a second look and just see what pj has tried to accomplish. as for the oscar season i think the following should go to trotk best picture - trotk best director - pj best supporting actor - sean austin best special effects best  best screenplay
