the lord of the rings: the return of the king concludes the journey of frodo sam and gollum to the fires of mordor. but while they proceed to mordor gollum has a nasty plan to get back at frodo for supposedly betraying him. and while this is happening pippin merry gandalf aragorn legolas gimli and the rest of the kingdom of rohan learn of saurons plan: to attack the kingdom of gondor for he knows that the heir of isildur aragorn has come back. so begins one of the biggest battles you will see on the screen. i must say this is a great way to end the series. yes its over 3 hours long but its still very good. and this is a film not a movie. a film. there is also much more emotion than in the other ones and you see the deterioration of frodo as the ring takes hold of him. please see this movie because if you think you thought that the first two were damn good you aint seen nothing yet.
