its hard for me to rate a comic book movie 100% the only movies of the genre that deserve this are superman1978 spider-man 2 and the dark knight but why right in the beginning we see the joker robbing a bank with a plan that is for me as good as the final plan of oceans eleven and this is only the first scene youll see  in the movie at least 2 equally brilliant plans. the jokers philosophy is so well made that in sometimes youll forget that he is just a maniac and even think that he is right. despite the fact that cristian bale is not very good playing bruce wayne its not that bad hes just there. now lets talk about the ledgers performance of course it deserved the oscar of course it is awesome but i think that its not only him that made this character great i mean almost every lines that comes out of the jokers mouth is memorable and its not only because ledgers performance its the excellent script that makes this. like the critic pablo villaca said  see the vulnerable and tragic figure of batman diving in the shadows of a city desperate for heroic figures is one of the strongest and saddest images that the genre ever produced  this complexity is what makes the dark knight different that other good superhero movies like iron man. verdict: with an unusual complexity the dark knight puts superhero movies in another degree of film-making and storytelling now go watch this.
