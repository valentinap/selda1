when i first saw this movie on video i was in 5th grade i expected to see a action film because bruce willis is in it but after the movie was over i was confused and totally lost by this movie the second time i saw it i was a junior at high school and i was totally fascinated by this movie as shown in reservoir dogs tarantinos answer first question later scenes are unique and amusing to watch also the dialogues are hilarious such as conversation about foot massages and actions are bit too violent but also great i also enjoyed john travolta and uma thurmans twist scens a lot the actings are superb john travolta samuel l jackson and uma thurman gave their best performances in their careers bruce willis was still pretencious but he was ok
