the dark knight is arguably the best movie ive ever seen on the big screen. it has everything that a viewer would want in a good film. the director has done a fantastic job. christian bale is the best batman/bruce wayne..i cant imagine anyone else filling for him. even the bad guys in this movie are awesome. the point that you dont know anything about the joker makes him a questionable character  get it . the joker cant kill batman because hes just too fun and batman has his own rules that he cant break  such as killing a man . the transformation of harvey dent was scary and the 50/50 chance of him murdering someone is even scarier because nobody knows who will survive. chance is unbiased said harvey. the ending is also quite atrocious for bales character. he has to disappear or else hell be hunted. why is he running dad - j.g junior
