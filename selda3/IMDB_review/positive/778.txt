keeping in mind that the two previous movies are really all meant as a complete picture i can truely say that this is a masterpiece. like the books that the movies are based on the movies are not always perfect in a traditional movie sense nor do they confine themselves to traditional filmaking. i have read the books three times now and yet pj and his team has manaaged to keep me on the edge of my seat and feel anxious when the characters or in peril... i do know certain aspects were left out including sauraman and the love blossoming between faramir and eowyn. with that said though pj made sure he did the theatrical version true to the books in the sense that we are never torn from the main characters of this story. i do have to say however that the real test will come when we have all three extended cuts of these movies and watch them in a marathon of 12 hours and watch them flow into one another. i cant wait 10/10  this movie has it all. if you love a movie that energizes all of your senses then check this one out. this truly is american film making at its finest.
