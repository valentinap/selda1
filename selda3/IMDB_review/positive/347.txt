there is nothing i like more than a good thriller that is without a doubt my favourite genre that being said it is quite rare that i came across one that really has me absolutely gripped from the opening minute to the very last at best i have only come across some pretty great ones however gone girl definitely takes the prize for the best one that i have ever seen i wish that i had read the book first so that i could comment on how faithfully it has been adapted however since the screenplay is written by flynn herself i can imagine that it doesnt hold much difference only in the character depth which is always better developed through the work of a novel for obvious reasons what i can say though is that it certainly was safe in the hands of the brilliantly talented david fincher fincher is simply one of the best directors out there after all this is the same man that has given us such memorable gems as the social network 2010 zodiac 2007 panic room 2002 seven 1995 and many more simply put gone girl was destined for his spectacular direction and boy did he deliver gone girl is a remarkable piece of filmmaking on so many different levels the story itself is one of the most thought provoking and engaging that i have ever had the pleasure of viewing it had me wonderfully gripped right from the off its not often that i find myself dissecting and questioning the events throughout the entire thing but this one brilliantly had my mind rollercoastering all the way through it twists and turns with such unique and refreshing mastery that you feel like the whole thing is happening around you gone girl is the screen definition of a spectacular page turner and fincher delivers it with some of the best direction that he has ever done i cant help but think that in the hands of anyone else this film would not have been executed with the same quality of impact that the story deserved this for me is one of his best films if not the best no small feat considering his fantastic library of work a novel adaptation of this calibre though cannot rely purely on the talents of its director to tell the story without a great cast to act it out it is nothing more than a great story weakly portrayed fortunately gone girl succeeds in this too i get pretty sick and tired with the constant ben affleck bashing to be honest i dont think that anyone can deny that he is an awesome director and a talented writer ill say that straight off but whilst he may have been less than aweinspiring an actor in his earlier years ill defy anybody to tell me that he has not improved with age i think people just need to accept the fact that he is the next batman and stop being so ridiculous about it which is basically what it comes down to i see far bigger stars that have had much longer careers that dont have the fraction of acting ability that affleck does affleck is so multidimensional in the role of nick dunne that you really dont know what to make of him as a character all you can only ever really do is speculate on his guilt and innocence and formulate your own ideas concerning what may or may not have happened dunnes cocksure and blas demeanour is a fantastic shield when trying to determine the level of involvement in his wifes disappearance if any at all he is uniquely likable and dislikable at the same time this is absolute credit to afflecks performance and capabilities he completely nails and owns this character from start to finish that being said as great as he is i think the best performance of the film truly belongs in the hands of rosamund pike as nicks wife amy she is unarguably magnificent there is not too much that i can say about her character to be honest only that pike really does show the strength of her acting skills and i loved every moment that she was on screen overall gone girl is a splendid thought provoking mystery with plenty of twists and turns that will have you gripped throughout it is a marvellous guessing game and one you will still be talking about long after the end credits have rolled it is ultimately satisfying and rewarding in its climax and you wont get to the end and question why you bothered watching it in the first place gone girl also has a great supporting cast including neil patrick harris tyler perry kim dickins carrie coon and missi pyle among others if you have not had the pleasure of seeing this yet then i highly recommend that you get on it as soon as you can you will not be disappointed easily one of the best films of the year stunning
