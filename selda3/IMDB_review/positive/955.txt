i wasnt expecting the twist on the sleeping beauty story the villain is actually the likable character in this plot i actually found that really interesting the witch wasnt the bad guy this time we at least got to understand the reason for her actions i almost never thought of the possibility that the witchs action was as a result of hurt the classic tales always makes it look like the witch placed the curse just because of the fact that she was evil well that was a nice plot twist i found the dramatic performance and the dialogue very theatrical almost like a stage play which made it really exciting the way the camera focused on jolies face was actually really cool i liked the effects in the movie not too much but just enough to make it exciting
