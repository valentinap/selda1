intense dark and terrified what a wonderful film based on comic character that has been one of the favorite hero for child for almost half centuries. this film is produced for them that grew up nowadays not for child today. what a wonderful cast on both hero and villain that gives us very intricate and attractive characters which all of them are both shed partially obviously traits and also hid some shade in shadow. great story telling and very nice concept that play with heros dilemma. provoke on ethical concept even on those folk on film and us in front of the screen. the best part of the film is joker by heath ledger.......
