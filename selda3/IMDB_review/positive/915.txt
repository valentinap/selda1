im a big fan of movies that have depth and tells a great story. american movies doesnt always provide that. the shawshank redemption however is a prime example of what american story telling can be. with a slight non-linear build up strong and patient character development the movie drags you more and more into the despair of andy dufresne but always with a sense of hope. for me theres no two ways about it. this is simply the best movie ever made. 10/10.  remember this: tolkien created lotr as a mythology and it was his aim that someone would one day re-write it and pass it down to new generations part of the mythical process and that is what jackson has done - continued the mythical process the trilogy on the whole is awesome  a must see
