seeing this movie twice i will admit that this movie does contain plot holes but overall it is still a highly enjoyable thriller with what i believe is some top notch acting both ben affleck and rosamund pike are great in their roles and both oscar worthy even tyler perry does a surprisingly great job in his role the  is a highlight worth mentioning in this review because it is amazing trent reznor and atticus ross did a superb job the soundtrack is amazing and should win an oscar because it is hauntingly powerful i recommend this movie for anyone willing to have a good time trying to witness a good thriller and great acting
