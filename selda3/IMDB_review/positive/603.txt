pulp fiction movie review although i am only 18 years of age barely a legal adult i must firmly say the film pulp fiction directed by quentin tarantino is the best film i have ever seen hands down the screenplay and storyline of the movie is not only intense but deeply intriguing as well the balance which is struck so masterfully by tarantino to appeal to a wide variety of movie enthusiasts is what makes the movie spectacular being a self proclaimed tarantino fan the structure and flow of this movie reminds of his first ever film reservoir dogs the film was nominated for over 5 oscar awards but ended up winning only one best original script winning best original script is no small achievement this award is a testament to the quality and time that tarantino puts into each of his movies and the script and plot line in pulp fiction is no different additionally the film has some of the best actors in the modern era starring in the movie the star cast includes samuel l jackson john travolta bruce willis uma thurman tim roth and ving rhames jackson and travolta team up in the movie to play a pair of hit men contracted to certain jobs by their boss ving rhames bruce willis plays the other hit men that has a personal beef with the boss of jackson and travolta uma thurman stars as the wife of ving rhames finally roth plays the psychotic husband of the couple that holds up the diner at the end of film each of the main actors in the movie have won at least two awards for their performances in prior films showing the quality of each actor together all six of them mesh beautifully to create a smooth yet emotional film after receiving what seemed like no praise or appreciation from the media pulp fiction finally won an oscar best screenplay this is by far the most original and well made film that i have ever seen many people have said that because the movie switches scenes and plot lines so much that the movie is unorganized and has no true story line i couldnt disagree with this statement more the way that the directors mesh the different scenes and plot lines of the movie is what makes the film legendary for example the main storyline in the movie is the combination of jules winfield samuel l jackson and vincent vega john travolta two hit men that work for marcellus ving rhames at times the film will show the two men carrying out hits extorting money or extracting information by all means necessary one of the prime examples of this is the apartment scene in which jackson and travolta enter the apartment of a handful of young men believed to be holding cash and information after they ask a few questions poke around for a bit and find what they need they make sure that all of the men are dead preventing them from causing future problems this is meant to show the business savvy side of travolta and jackson and evoke intense emotion from the viewer but in the next scene a completely different type of john travolta is shown which is what makes his character so dynamic and appealing to the audience as travolta and jacksons boss leaves town his boss mia uma thurman asks travolta to take her on a date both of them are clearly high on drugs when they meet making for an interesting line of action travolta takes her to a 1950s diner which doubles as a dance club at night as the scene progresses thurman volunteers them for a dance much to the dismay of travolta travolta reluctantly accepts following thurman to the stage the dance goes well as the two perform beautifully and receive a standing ovation from the crowd but this is just the beginning of a disastrous night as the two leave the diner they return to thurmans house as travolta goes to the bathroom mia discovers a bag of heroin which she mistakes to be cocaine as travolta comes back to the living room he finds her lying on the ground motionless with blood running down her nose this leads travolta to believe that it is an od travolta brings thurman to a friends house where she is administered an adrenaline shot straight to the heart this sequence of the film is a prime example of balancing slow suspenseful action with intense on the edge of your seat emotion no other director has the talent or formula to combine drama action mystery and suspense all into one screenplay besides tarantino grossing over $107000000 lifetime many fans and movie enthusiasts agree with me as well boxofficemojocom each time i watch the movie i realize that it is one of the few films that i can enjoy every single time the legendary actors skillful directing and balance of several different plot lines creates a masterpiece in my opinion that is why pulp fiction is the greatest film of all time
