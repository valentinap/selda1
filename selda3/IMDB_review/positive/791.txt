ive seen a lot of movies in my day and a lot i have said are the best ever but pulp fiction has to be the best the way this movie depicts the world of la crime is like no other ever will the unique way the stories are told will never be matched the way scares the heck out of you so fast then makes you burst out in laughter is awesome the way tarentino built up the characters it felt like you knew all them personally and finally the cast the cast was absolutely perfect for this movie  i mean who else could have played jules except samuel l in conclusion see pulp fiction it will be like no other movie youve ever seen if you are worried about the language it fits in with the movie so when you think about it its not really that bad
