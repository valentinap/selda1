this is a masterpiece tarantino changed cinema forever when he created these characters it is not one individual effort that makes this film what it is however from the sublime direction to the quick witted script that keeps you on your toes throughout to the phenomenal and underrated performances by john travolta and uma thurman pulp fiction is perfection i went into this film with high expectations i had recently been introuduced to tarantino through his previous feature reservoir dogs which was also very good and so was anxious to see how he would handle a bigger production with a bigger budget and some of hollywoods best willis jackson travolta but there was no need to be as i was delivered a masterclass in film a very simple premise of two mob men dispatched on a daily round evolves into something much more and the with regards to the mystery of the contents of the briefcase a risky move by tarantino but it ultimately paid off as people still speculate to this day about it my belief is it contained his soul the way in which tarantino takes these apparently different stories and mixes them together to create some truly spectacular scenes is applaudable to say the least
