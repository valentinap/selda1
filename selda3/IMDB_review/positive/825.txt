its 400 in the morning and i just saw that almost three hours long movie but yet there was not a single moment of sleepy like it would come with other movies that is the greatest story ever made the true life so much ordinary things that it becomes noordinary film whit lots of energy enthusiasm i got that feeling like falling in love or being on the most beautiful place you ever seen it forces you to think a lot                           i could probably wrote much more but than no one would start to read  ps sorry for my english
