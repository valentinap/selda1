i used to like action movies more than anything else. i watched shawshank redemption in 2007. when i watched it for the first time i did not know that it is a great movie. when i watched it for the second time i felt that it should be one of the greatest movies. for the first time checked imdbs top 250 movies and i amazed to see shawshank redemption at number two anyway its number one at present. the performances of all the artists are excellent. not a single character is waste. especially tim robins excels as andy dufresne. narration by morgan freeman is sensational. the scenes between morgan freeman and tim robins are by far the best. the ending is one of best surprises i have seen in movies. this movie should have got the ascar. i give 10 out of 10 for this phenomenal movie.
