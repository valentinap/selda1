the fact that i can repeatedly sit through a film that is over 3.5 hours long and still be fully entertained is somewhat of a wonder to me. there are some movies that i cringe my way through or am so bored that i check the time and cant wait for it to be over but not the lotr. this movie perfectly captures the world that tolkien created by combining several flawless elements that work to make this one of the best movies ever made. the acting cast cgi wardrobe and general attention to the simplest of details are what makes this a truly magical movie. from the mountain of books in the background of bilbos study to the rust and grime on the armor of the orc berserkers its the painstaking attention to detail that makes this movie endlessly re-watchable and timelessly beautiful.
