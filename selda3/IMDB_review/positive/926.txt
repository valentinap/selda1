if you like previous fincher works like the game then you will thoroughly enjoy this as it is full of stylish twists and turns in the film making as someone thats not a huge affleck fan i felt he really did a good job with this role but rosamund pike steals the show with her performance the soundtrack is really well done sounding like a mix between vangelis and nine inch nails at points i believe films should be advertised purely by who directs it as a david fincher fan this film is truly damn near perfect from the subtle perversion within editing the innovative soundtrack and especially great social commentary i honestly feel this film will receive negative reviews purely for the issues it looks essentially the opposite effect of a movie like the butler
