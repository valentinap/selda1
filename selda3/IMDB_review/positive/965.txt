i walked into this movie expecting something magical from director richard linklater and he did not disappoint at no point did the aging process seem gimmicky it flowed with each year of his life being one heartfelt episode after another while i expected there to be some giant emotional scene one scene that would be sure to make everyone in the theater weep im almost glad i didnt get it while there were some sweet scenes that i wont get into i liked this fully honest tale of growing into oneself with genius writing and wondrous acting especially from the leads coltrane and arquette with the latter i expect a best supporting actress nomination this should go down as a film along the lines of many other great comingofage films that everyone young and old should experience at least once in their lifetime
