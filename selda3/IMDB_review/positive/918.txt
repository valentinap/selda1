ill be honest folks. this film simply blew me over. yes it has some niggling faults but it remains highly recommended. ledger is mesmerizing as the joker. a weaker actor would have hurt the film as the plot isnt airtight but you simply cant tear your eyes away from him while hes on screen. bale takes some getting used to as batman is completely in the jokers shadow in this film. its a competent performance from him. everyone else does a reasonable job and there are no weak links in the cast. i thought eckhart did very well with a difficult role. the last hour is slower than the preceding two but the film manages to hold your attention completely. unlike the uplifting end of batman begins this film ends on a downer. impressive 10/10
