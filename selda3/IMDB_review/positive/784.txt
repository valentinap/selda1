j. r. r. tolkien was one of my first fantasy writers that i have ever read. i have read this book many times so when this film came out it was like a birthday present to me. the 1978 animated lord of the rings at least gave me something to visualize but with peter jacksons version i felt like dorothy waking up in the land of oz for the first time. the filming was great even with all of the cgi content. great actors will make this film a long-time favorite for fans of the books and those who have only seen the films. a great movie has details and in the return of the king you can appreciate the details and history that is brought out by the characters in their words and actions. i absolutely love the scene when the witch king is defeated i remember the audience in the theater cheering when this took place. even at the end when the hobbits are honored it still brings a tear to my eyes. i have watched these movies over 100 times already and i am always ready to watch it again. i use these three films every time we play games as background music.  the serious violence of american gangster movies crime movies and films noise mixed up with the wacky violence of cartoons video games and japanese animation  and the fragmented story-telling structures of such experimental classics as citizen kane rashomon and la joete. the oscar-winning script by tarantino and roger avary intertwines three stories featuring samuel l. jackson and john travolta in the role that single-handedly reignited his career as hit men who have philosophical interchanges on such topics as the french names for american fast food products  bruce willis as a boxer out of a 1940s b-movie  and such other stalwarts as harvey keitel tim roth christopher walken eric stoltz ving rhames and uma thurman whose dance sequence with travolta proved an instant classic.
