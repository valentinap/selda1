well folks thats how its done ever thought mi6 note thats what the british call their secret service is a club for snobbish upper class dudes who like to watch paint dry all they long? ok bond is kind of cool i hated the last two though but now we finally got a film that takes spy movies to the next level not since district 9 have i had that feeling during the watching of a film like this movie just does everything right by which i mean of course it plays exactly to my taste compared to this film every james bond movie released after licence to kill looks like a snorefest this is such a kickass balls against the wall crazy ride that i had to shake my head several times in disbelief during the screening i was invited to and i actually knew what i was in for ive seen every film by matthew vaughn but i was not prepared how far he was willing to go with this one thought kickass was pretty crazy? wait till you see this one of the key ingredients is the casting of the actors the well known stars all play against type which makes this even more unreal remember that lame dude who mainly played lame dudes in girlie movies like bridget jones? he just won an oscar for playing the stuttering king of england and as you will see in kingsman that oscar was well deserved that dude colin firth can play anything hes more badass in this than bond ever was a word to the wise though this film is not for the easily offended or the squeamish it is a comedy but a very very violent kind of comedy and the language alone will shock the mpaa out of their pants watch this if youre into films like lock stock kickass or in bruges and youll probably love it  dont bother if youre more into serious films or family friendly comedies as for me i had a bloody good time
