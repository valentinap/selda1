the fellowship makes its final path through war and wilderness. the story comes to an 11 academy award winning climax. the movie has a stunning power unlike the other two. peter jackson uses incredible insight into sstories and themes and character study. the return of the king culminates its three story lines unimaginably. as the characters finish what is a three year journey you see exactly why peter jackson made the fellowship and the two towers because he wanted to arrive at this incredible finale to what is a career trilogy. i enjoyed this film for two main reasons action and intimacy. the action is stunningly realized by weta workshop. but even though the action is great at the center of it is what is a wonderfully intimate story. as frodo and sam make their way to mount doom we really get to see them both rise to the occasion. we see the real power of friendship as gollum continues to try to break it. when aragorn and gandalf arrive at over 600.000 orcs and yet they stand as strong as they were at helms deep. i become more amazed as the tale goes on we see how difficult and at what price will either side win. the feelings of community within us. this is a classic and whoever watches will not be disappointed. 10/10
