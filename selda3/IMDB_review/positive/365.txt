the ultimate action with a dazzling mind game incredible acting superb technology innovation with a tint of fiction makes this movie my one of the favorites. finding the goodness even after you surrounded by evil souls and losing your dear ones is what the batman gives the message. christian bale is the most deserving actor for this role and the great heath ledger rip. the dark night rises is also a great hammer on the nail but it was no match to this one. christopher nolan work will be accredited lifelong. and it is his remarkable work which has left its mark on fans heart. for all those who hadnt got the chance take time its worth it and for those who have watched it i bet you wouldnt have been got away with jokers magic.
