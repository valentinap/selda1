ive decided that there are two types of people in this world: people who get pulp fiction and people who dont i feel very sorry for the people who dont this is one of the funniest most enjoyable two hours ive ever spent in a theater i went into it halfway expecting not to like it and i came out a rabid fan samuel l jackson is the finest actor in film today and this movie is responsible for putting him on the map not to mention jump-starting the career of john travolta sure theres lots of violence and profanity--but thats what makes the movie im not one of those die-hard tarantino fans either i hated reservoir dogs ugh my other favorite movie along with this one is when harry met sally hows that for diversity i dont understand how anyone could not like this movie its been imitated many times since but when it came out it was very different than anything else that had been done if you find it hard to follow the first time watch it again youll understand the back-and-forth-in-time concept then every performance in it was great--and it has many lines that will be quoted for years to come i couldve done without ving rhames rape scene but other than that it was perfect 5 out of 5 stars
