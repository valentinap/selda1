this movie was great definitely a five star movie four star at the lowest tom cruise acted really well it was exciting and they didnt make it all killing death etc this movie was exciting as it sounded so there was no ripoff however i do think they could have created less talking and more doing so it would be very fun and not exactly like the real thing in life after all it is fictional stuff its no real its not based on a true story but besides that this movie was good this movie has very little cuss words which makes it more easier for more parents to saying yes to their kids on watching this awesome movie this is a movie for the young and old who love action like this i personally can not wait to get this on dvd and i can not wait to see its sequels mi2 mi3 and mission impossible ghost protocol you will want to do all the same enjoy this great movie that will always be a great spy classic for years
