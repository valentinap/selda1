the shawshank redemption undoubtedly deserves to be the highest rated movie. the movie depicts how a four lettered word hope brings wonders to our lives and makes something impossible to possible. though the plot of the movie focuses on how andy dufrane a falsely convicted prisoner gets out of the prison the beauty of the movie lies in the characterization of andy dufrane just amazing and how he influences his fellow prisoner red. the narration by morgan freeman in the role of red is perhaps one of the best narrations i have ever come across. this story proves that the king of horrors stephen king is equally good at any other genre of story writinghats off. the dialogues towards the end of the movie about hope are truly inspiring. the background  of the movie is excellent. tom robbins and morgan freeman at their best in the roles of andy dufrane and red respectively. didnt watch the movie...go grab a dvd and watch it as soon as possible. cant miss a movie like this....
