ill keep this short and sweet. i am not the type of person who reads critique reviews and determines whether that will make me watch a movie or not. however i didnt think i would ever want to see this movie after seeing the preview and a friend said it was a bit slow. i have to honestly say that i was impressed by the directing acting and overall story. this is a great move you should defiantly take the time out of your life to see a great movie that is not a superhero remake. this story has structure purpose and meaning. though if you cant sit still then dont bother. however i do think its time we get some culture back in our lives.
