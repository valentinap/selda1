there is not a fault that you can declare with a film that was shot for 12 years kept the exact same cast and delivered a powerful movie of a boy named mason its great to go and criticise movies but there was a moment that i could flaw this film with the unnoticeable changes of years it provides you with so many segments that create such power moods that you can relate to as a person growing up i call this a feel good film it has its funny moments and quite frankly was enjoyable all the way through there are dark scene that were delivered quite perfect that really left me pinned back in my seat after watching the trailer it was fair to say i had already classed this movie as beautiful and it sure was indeed finding a movie these days to please you is quite a difficult task whereas this movie has a simple plot growing up how you deal with yourself and what you will come across the movie really makes you feel as though you are growing up with it adapting to the really likable characters is consistent there is a lot of movies that have blew me away this year and by the forgotten director in my eyes linklater has really shown up to me and provides a movie that will feed your every instinct in what you love about a movie boyhood is beautiful
