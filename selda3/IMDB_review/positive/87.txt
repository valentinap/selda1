what pulp fiction does is not give you the normal rinky-dink point-a to point-b generic movie the film isnt about plot progression what tarantino does in essence is create an entire world this is a vast interwoven interacting multi-varied facet of a criminal underworld in which we quickly find interest and empathy in vivid solid characters what this film conveys is a kind of charisma not only from each of these character but from the synergy they create as a whole that can make you feel like you have really stepped into their world into another life and accept this morally ambiguous modern-day epic truly there has not been a more enriched and wholly enthralling film to have been released in the last decade if not longer and lastly on a personal level while i do not believe that this is the ultimate masterpiece of film history it is personally my favorite film and was the defining film that has lead me towards a career in the film industry so obviously it must have something going for it
