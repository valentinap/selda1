in its oscar year shawshank redemption written and directed by frank darabont after the novella rita hayworth and the shawshank redemption by stephen king was nominated for seven academy awards and walked away with zero. best picture went to forrest gump while shawshank and pulp fiction were just happy to be nominated. of course hindsight is 20/20 but while history looks back on gump as a good film pulp and redemption are remembered as some of the all-time best. pulp however was a success from the word go making a huge splash at cannes and making its writer-director an american master after only two films. for andy dufresne and co. success didnt come easy. fortunately failure wasnt a life sentence. after opening on 33 screens with take of $727327 the $25m film fell fast from theatres and finished with a mere $28.3m. the reasons for failure are many. firstly the title is a clunker. while iconic to fans today in 1994 people knew not and cared not what a shawshank was. on the dvd tim robbins laughs recounting fans congratulating him on that rickshaw movie. marketing-wise the films a nightmare as prison drama is a tough sell to women and the story of love between two best friends doesnt spell winner to men. worst of all the movie is slow as molasses. as desson thomson writes for the washington post it wanders down subplots at every opportunity and ignores an abundance of narrative exit points before settling on its finale. but it is these same weaknesses that make the film so strong. firstly its setting. the opening aerial shots of the prison are a total eye-opener. this is an amazing piece of architecture strong and gothic in design. immediately the prison becomes a character. it casts its shadow over most of the film its tall stone walls stretching above every shot. it towers over the men it contains blotting out all memories of the outside world. only andy robbins holds onto hope. its in music its in the sandy beaches of zihuatanejo
