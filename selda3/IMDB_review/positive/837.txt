it looks as though maleficent is another of those movies that sits under the disney banner yet is far from a childrens only movie theres death destruction duplicity and derring do in equal measure yes despite the fact that there are fairies nymphs and other mythical creatures that might inhabit the usual childrens story this would probably sit more comfortably with the original grimm stories than disneys animated version from 1959 the fact is though after the pirates of the caribbean series we are fast becoming used to a more adult story line in disneys live action movies and in my opinion theyre all the better for it maleficent appears to follow the same course as sleeping beauty but is far less predictable and has a large number of twists and turns seeing the story from a refreshing viewpoint that of the socalled wicked witch  who this time isnt a witch at all the stereotypes that usually accompany disney films with this kind of story premise are still there but this time are somehow more real maleficent presents us with a very believable plot  despite and including the fairies  and strong characters with very real motivation the approach used in this movie was enough to keep us glued to the screen from beginning to end with jolie in brilliant form in the lead role the story was riveting keeping us guessing right up until the end
