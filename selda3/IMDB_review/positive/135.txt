warning spoiler alert which actually isnt a spoiler but i am just doing this so i wont get black listed now to start off what i love about this movie is that it skewers conventional thinking in almost every aspect of the film and does not just skewer it but it unleashes an entire swath of that could be possible type stuff into the films very amazing plot warning warning not so much a spoiler alert ahead while most people usually find it offensive to kill a head of state i find it refreshing to see directors who arent afraid to go there sort of speak but trust me it goes there pretty well wink wink the movie itself is filled with an elaborate but easy to follow storyline with uncanny plot twists and unexpected you kinda understand but kinda hate him bad guys kinsmen will remain in my heart one of the best and most unapologetic spy films i have ever seen just a heads up if you are in any ways biased towards politics of conservative liberal progressive green republican or any kind of ends justify the means marxist kinda politics this movie isnt for you so my word of advice is to pretend for about 2 hours that your not associated with any politics what so ever and enjoy the film
