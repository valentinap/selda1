we are in an age where the audience can choose to view a film featuring 3-dc.g.i. and special effects. the audience may also choose to find a film which has a solid story line a remarkable plot and surprises in an unpredictable series of events. but you cant have both. this is the general rule...however with the exception of the dark knight and only a few others all of these effects seem to be necessary to attain this culmination of an a+ plot direction acting and production. definitely in my top 3 list of all time favorites. thank you to everyone who was able to make this film what it is. one thing that makes this film special is its unique ability to stand alone as a solid film without ever seeing the prequel or sequel.
