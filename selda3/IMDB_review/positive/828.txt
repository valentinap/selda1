it was the best film i have ever seen and could watch it over again. it was quite disappointing that saruman wasnt in there but because of that you had a slightly happier ending. if he had been in there the film would have been 45 minutes longer. anybody that is still confused should read the book rather than wait a year until the extended version comes out.
