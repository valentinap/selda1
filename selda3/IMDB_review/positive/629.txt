pulp fiction definitely is a knockout film apart from the intelligent original and refreshing chronological intertwine of different storylines the brilliant script is a gem it succeeds in making the mix of absurdly gross and directly shot violence and all day chit-chat more than believable where else have you seen a guy commenting on the quality of his victim-to-bes kahunaburger and asking him a sip of his beverage to wash it down seconds before pumping everyone in the room full-o-lead  when did you last see a scene in which one of the 2 bad guys accidently erase their captives brains during a car ride and then discuss the mess it creates the bump in the road that caused this and whos supposed to clean up without worrying even the slightest about the mans death  not to speak of walken in a small role handing willis the watch that according to his monologue sat years in someones there-where-the-sun-dont-shine before being handed on without being completely unbelievable  all this completed with a cool worth-wile soundtrack very retro-sixties/seventies a great well-picked cast and the magic tarantino touch this movie rocks
