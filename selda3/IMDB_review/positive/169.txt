this trilogy is the best movie i ever saw. it contains everything that you will see in a movie fantasy horror drama action romance some comedy and more. the effects are great and its based on one of the best book i ever read. either the cast is very good chosen. jackson made everything good. it was great as i saw it for the first time. after that i saw the movies about teen times and every time i liked it more and more. i was very happy as i heard the news that the hobbit begun to be filmed and as i saw the first part i was very happy. only the cast was not very good for me but in all it was good. i cant wait to see in the cinemas the second part of the hobbit.
