the dark knight not only pushes the boundaries to be a better super hero film it not only pushes the boundaries to be a better drama- it pushes the boundaries of masterpiece. it is a near-perfect depiction of how one man can really make a difference good or bad. this makes the film more compelling than the average action film. i will not go into detail about heath ledgers performance but in short it changed the industry. if you havent seen this film yet exit this page dont rent the movie buy it and just watch it until you realize that you are seeing a film of class and quality and know that every second that goes by is worth it.  not a single minute could be considered a bad acting well at least i think so. entertaining for it makes you enjoy the time spend on it and once finished there are no regrets. i am not a huge fan of tim robbins but the movie undoubtedly showed his talent. mr. freeman stays solid as usual in his act.
