im just gonna start off by saying i love this movie.its one of my favorites of all time. i honestly cant think of too much wrong with this movie other than its a little long and batmans by now infamous voice. but everything else is top notch. the actingstoryatmosphereand actions scenes are all amazing. if you havent seen this movie see it right now i went into this not expecting to much but i came out blown away i cant imagine any movie being much better. ill just have to wait for the dark knight rises to release to see if anything can be better. until then this stands as the best movie ive ever seen
