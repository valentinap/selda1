when i first watched pulp fiction i was completely controlled by its energy tarantino was able to lead the entire audience around like pepe-la-peu was lead by the scent of perfume i have since watched it countless times and realized that the details are what carry this movie the big picture the basic stories the characters the situations that bring them together is extremely interesting and alone would have been sufficient yet tarantino threw in details that you wouldnt notice were placed on purpose for example listen to the dialogue and notice how references are made in passing notice that the reason mia odd was because she snorted heroin thinking that it was coke since it was in a baggy rather than a balloon tarantino set that scene up subtley in lances bedroom almost an hour before the od many movie-watchers go over a film with a fine-toothed comb in order to find mistakes that the director or the actors made in pulp fiction tarantino raises the bar by giving us treats to find within the details
