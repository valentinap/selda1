if you havent seen 2014s divergent or read veronica roths trilogy the divergent series insurgent pg13 159 may be a little hard to follow but i think its worth the effort so heres what you missed within a walled city just outside the ruins of downtown chicago in a postapocalyptic world over two centuries in the future people are divided into five factions which perform the major functions of society the erudite faction is made up of the smart people _ and they are the societys rulers candor is the faction for honest people _ societys judges dauntless are the strong athletic and fearless _ the perfect people to help keep order the abnegation faction includes the selfless souls who help others _ and last but not least amity is a community of peaceful farmers at about the age that people graduate from high school in our society in this brave new divergent world these young adults take a virtual reality test that reveals their aptitude _ which is supposed to be their destiny this is a real problem of beatrice prior shailene woodley her test results are inconclusive she shows attributes of multiple factions that makes her divergent a threat to the social order she conceals her divergence picks dauntless as her faction changes her name to tris and begins her training she struggles but works very hard to succeed if she flunked out shed become factionless a group of homeless people _ without jobs and without a place in society although tris does start doing better in her training she is found out to be divergent she ends the first film on the run with her brother caleb ansel elgort peter miles teller who is her dauntless classmate and bitter rival and a young man who calls himself four theo james and is her dauntless instructor and newfound love interest the insurgent story picks up just days after the story in divergent ends tris four caleb and peter are hiding out with the amity faction led by johanna octavia spencer tris is racked with guilt over the death of her parents but she keeps trying to suppress her feelings along with her feelings for four because shes intent on getting to the erudite leader jeannine kate winslet _ and killing her but first these rebels have to find the rest of their fellow dauntless friends that left the training complex with them _ and avoid the dauntless citizens who remained loyal to jeanine and are still being led by eric jai courtney and max mekhi phifer while tris is trying to get to jeanine jeanine continues to hunt divergents but not just because she considers them a threat jeannines minions have found a metal box decorated with the symbols of each of the factions it contains a message from their societys founders something that jeannine believes will validate her authority in the meantime tris and company also encounter candor led by jack kang daniel day kim and a group of the factionless led by a mysterious woman named evelyn a brunette naomi watts all the factions play significant roles in this film as do the major characters who survived the first film one who didnt and some interesting new characters this is the first sequel ive reviewed and spent more time talking about the original film than the one im reviewing but there are good reasons for that first of all unlike most welldone sequels its hard to appreciate the second without understanding what happened in the first the context is important and you cant talk about insurgent without knowing the basic vocabulary from divergent secondly there are so many twists turns and surprises in this second film that i cant say much about the story without revealing major plot points its not that the sequels plot is hard to follow but i really try to stay away from spoilers all this is a way of saying that this second film of the divergent series builds very well on the story of its predecessor and doesnt waste any time establishing an identity of its own as great a job as the first film did highlighting the importance of being yourself the divergent series insurgent writes that message as if with lightning the action is heightened in the second installment and so is the emotion and adding to the message of individuality are powerful messages of selflessness and forgiveness _ forgiveness of others and of yourself the story is fastpaced and thrilling the climactic scene is shocking and profound at least for those of us who havent read the books and the ending is to die for a lot of the professional critics dont seem to like this movie very much but i think theyre missing something maybe im just divergent but im giving this film an a
