if this film isnt making you smile or at least listen attentively as if you were in on a private candid conversation then its knocking you on your butt flooring you with some gripping scene or perhaps a slightly confusing yet pleasing turn in editing schematic unless of course youre my mother and are offended by the language and/or violence and stop watching i remember walking out of the theater with my friend thinking id just seen something amazing and that id never seen anything like it before i still remember the riveting tense feeling i had when butch played by bruce willis decides to go back for his fathers gold watch at his apartment certain that gangsters like john travoltas vincent vega are looking for him the long walk to his apartment through the back alleyways and yards was incredibly tense as you got the feeling the man was walking into certain death and then the moment he thinks everything is fine he decides to toast a pop tart i thought my heart was going to burst out of my chest and later still when you think everything is fine again youre floored by another predicament the only time this sort of experience works in my opinion is when you see a good movie for the first time in a theater naturally the second time round does not produce the same kind of tension unless of course you suffer from amnesia and dont remember what happens but what im getting at is the relationship you develop with a film in a theater versus at home on video for me pulp fiction is just one example of many where the experience was vastly enhanced by the cinematic environment
