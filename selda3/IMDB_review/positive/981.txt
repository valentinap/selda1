i think that almost everything that can be said about this trilogy has been said already but still i will try. there are so many films that destroyed the beauty and perfection of the novels they have been built upon not this one. in front of an amazingly beautiful scenery peter jackson was able to create a fantasy-movie which unlike so many others before did not deal with old clich’©s and thus is far away from any trash-movie a lot of people had expected it to be beforehand. although i am sure that the cast of this film will soon be forgotten the the lord of the rings-trilogy will stand the times and be one of the most renowned pictures of the las decade.
