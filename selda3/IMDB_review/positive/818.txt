its been 5 years since the dark knight was shown into theaters. i was 9 when i watched it and it was good. i kinda appreciated it when i returned on becoming a dc fan back in 2011 when the new 52 came yes i am a new 52 non-hater. the movie is so good that i kept on watching it over and over again. a total reinvention of batman. it received a heck lot of awards and nominated for so many times. first superhero film to reach 1b worldwide and it is not. the avengers heath ledger did an amazing job as the joker. christian bale once again took over the role and nailed it again. it is better than the dark knight rises which happened to be a not so good work for nolan. nolan wasnt planning for a third film but it happened. this led to a lot of mistakes and flaws. the dark knight had lots of interesting scenes and intense action. i just hope we can study the movie for my literature class. scene by scene we can discuss. ha ha. it had good music good tone and epic directing. it went on into a good direction rises not so much. i loved the movie and better than man of steel. it didnt waste your 2 hours in which in mos did. even though i loved the movie.......i like how each character bruce alfred lucius joker harvey gordon did a great job. two-face had an amazing reinvention too. better than the tommy. lee-jones two-face in batman forever. the dark knight was an unexpected movie. it did amazing great after. batman begins was released in 2005 and three years later you have the perfect superhero movie sequel. rip to heath ledger. won best supporting actor in the oscars....died with a great movie and one of the best movies in hollywood history and it will always be remembered. now that ben affleck will take over i expect good acting skills and how he acts as both batman and bruce wayne... thanks for reading
