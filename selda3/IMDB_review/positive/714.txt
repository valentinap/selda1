nolan made a wise decision in separating the dark knight from batman begins in that he never tries to mimic it. while the dark and gritty feel of begins is certainly prevalent in the sequel knight is its own film with its own story. it rarely if ever feels like batman begins 2. it goes without saying that the performances are stellar but i cant not praise the actors. christian bale is as he needs to be as is morgan freeman michael caine and gary oldman. even though maggie gyllenhaal was cast due to katie holmess inability to return i think she was a necessary change in order to show rachels growth. aaron eckhart is always a joy to watch and he certainly doesnt disappoint here. heath ledger deserves an oscar
