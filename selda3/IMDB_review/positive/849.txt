it is 2014 and i still dont get tired of seeing this movie. and by this movie iam not referring to the third part but all of them. it is a movie that has everything youd like to be in a movie: it is the movie with more body count 836 only in this part it has action adventure and even you could see romance between some characters.it is impossible to get bored with this film it is full of epic quotes epic scenes and epic wars all this complemented with a good story. all in all this movie deserves a 10 and in my humble opinion it is the best movie you can see ever. many years will have to pass to see a movie better than this.
