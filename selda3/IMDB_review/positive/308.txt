this is an amazing film let me get that out of the way first there is no doubt about it the cast list alone is impressive samuel l jackson john travolta bruce willis and many other top celebrities along with walk on parts for steve buscimi and even quentin tarantino himself the overall plot of pulp fiction could be quite hard to follow as it isnt set out chronologically but you will figure out whats happening when eventually ive watched this film around 5 or 6 times and every time i watch it i notice something new the first time i watched it i thought it was more of a crime action/thriller but you will soon realise that it can be classed quite easily as a comedy alot of the jokes are well hidden and there are a few in-jokes but anyone on this website will probably get them one point though this film is not for the faint hearted there are some scenes of violence and general not being nice one scene in particular which i seriously hope you wouldnt want to see i wont say any more but yuck
