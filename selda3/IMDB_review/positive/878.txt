in my opinion i believe this movie was an epic tail of a boy whos parents were murdered by a thug. until one day the boy decided to take action and soon became the protagonist in this movie also would be known as batman.our hero the dark night tends to protect the civilians of gothem city from his worst enemies and other so forth criminals. the antagonist is an evil but smart man named bane. bane and his army tend to defeat batman and take over the city but batman does not allow it and an epic battle is created with many detail and quality. i would highly recommend this film to all viewers who are dc comic fans of dc movie watchers. but if you just want action and adventure this is the movie for all of you viewers.  even though in a way it is not entirely unexpected. it is particularly enlivened by the presence of morgan freeman who should have won an oscar for his voice-overs alone. in a word exceptional.
