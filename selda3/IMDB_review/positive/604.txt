pulp fiction may be one of the most profoundly misunderstood films of our time one critic even called it a glorification of two whacked out hit-menothers called it flippant nihilistic and cynical yet others took the bizarre line that no film should be made about such worthless characters yet others called it plotless and formless however a careful viewing of tarantino s film should reveal that  like most of the pulp fiction  on which it is based it is indeed profoundly moral even more tarantinos film earnestly grapples with spiritual issues tarantino has carefully studied the films of dreyer and bresson as well as those of don spiegel and phil karlson to make my case for the spiritual -and moral core of this film i will merely call attention to the ending of each of its three episodes each one ends with a human life or lives being saved yes  there is cynicism flippancy and studied coolness in pulp fiction however this is merely the glossy packaging in which tarantino has concealed his profoundly-and rigorously- moral and spiritual message this is a film about redemption
