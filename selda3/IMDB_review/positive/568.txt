see the movie... it rocks its the best of the 3 and perfectly completes the trilogy. ill be seeing it again and again and again. after seeing it go back and watch the extended additions of 1 and 2. everything i saw in 1 and 2 makes total sense. cool foreshadowing of people and events too. i can hardly wait for the directors cut to come out  everyone is in dynamic form though it is perhaps jackson as the bible-bashing smart-mouthed hit-man jules who leaves the most lasting impression. his career post- pulp fiction has been quite simply a twenty year success story. theres an abundance of terrific individual scenes too _ба the adrenalin- shot-to-the-heart sequence in which vincent saves mia from a drug overdose  the clean-up of marvins corpse after being accidentally shot by vincent  christopher walkens unforgettable single-scene cameo in which he describes the history of butchs gold watch_б_ it would take too long to list all of the films many wonderful vignettes  lets just say it overflows with great moments. different viewers will take from it their own particular favourites. if reservoir dogs hailed the emergence of a fiery raw talent in tarantino pulp fiction marks a quantum leap in style control and story-telling bravado. it remains a brilliant film only tarantinos second behind the cameras but still a strong contender for his best.
