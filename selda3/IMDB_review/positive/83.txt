whats fantastic about tarantino is his ability to make films that are entertaining throughout he does this in part by having his characters discuss off subject things which really helps the characters and doesnt hinder performance in any way hes absolutely fantastic at writing dialogue and it really adds to it pulp fiction feels vibrant pulp fiction feels alive and far from interminable it knows exactly what direction it going in it feels fresh and innovative due to the clever story structure that doesnt feel convoluted at all the story structure to me actually aids the ending and the film as a whole incredibly clever stuff from tarantino over time tarantino films have become more and more bloated but this and reservoir dogs were perfectly restrained films to be both wild and restrained at the same time to me is an impressive feat performance wise i think everyone here is on top form its an interesting cast and a brave cast but it absolutely fits i enjoyed willis more than usual as he seems more free and relaxed travolta is handled very well which is something that i would have thought is very hard to do his characters need to be tongue in cheek and thats certainly the case here for me this is a film that can only really be done once doing away with narrative structure in this way gives it a completely unique feel whilst still being compelling i think few could pull this off in fact i doubt even tarantino could pull it off again for bravery creative spark unique tone awesome writing and pure entertainment value i cant not give this a ten ten out of ten
