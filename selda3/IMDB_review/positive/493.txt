the dark knight is one of my favorite movies of all-time. i really didnt expect much before i saw the film but when i did i was complete blown away. this is the way superhero movies should be made instead of making forgettable popcorn flicks. all actors that includes christian bale heath ledger aaron eckhart michael cain gary oldman maggie gyllenhaal morgan freeman brought there a game in the superhero drama. this movie isnt overrated because it deserves all the credit its been getting including heath ledgers performance as the joker. the movie had a great script thanks to christopher nolan and his brother jonathan. the acting cinematography action and editing is outstanding and all the film crews did a phenomenal job. id like to thank the director christopher nolan for influencing me as an aspiring filmmaker and putting a lot of heart into the dark knight. 10 out of 10
