you could look long and hard and never find a film more fun to watch than missionimpossible its classy stylish and heartpounding first let me address the frequent complaints about an overly complex plot this is not true there are a few lines you shouldnt miss but pay attention as you watch and you will be fine ie dont wander off to get popcorn ethan hunt is an american agent who has been framed and falsely accused of treason and the murder of his team he strikes out to clear his name with a group of similarly disavowed agents together they must prove that ethan was set up and prevent a dangerous weapons dealer from accessing a list that would betray the identities of every american deep cover agent alive the story is well constructed without the typical action movie plot holes the film is well balanced between action and dialog but the best part of mi is ethan hunt whom tom cruise not only portrays but lives and defines a rare action hero with a brain ethan is quick fit savvy with both a computer and a gun driven and determined he thinks quick on his feet and doesnt look back but the most rare and valuable trait he possesses is his powerful magnetism and charisma he makes you like him and instead of coming across as arrogant his confidence and assurance draw you to him i almost never give a film a 1010 rating but missionimpossible is one of those rare films that gets every detail right theres nothing to dislike and everything to enjoyhighly recommended
