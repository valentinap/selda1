this movie has got to be one of the craziest films ever made. including the all-star cast & the different story lines how it all comes together in the end so to speak is brilliant. first time i seen this i didnt know what i was in for but glad i did. tarantino at his original best is still around the time this film was made. 5 stars qt this is by far one of his best works now lets just hope that mr. willis doesnt want to do a 2nd part to this ... that would be just scary. dont know hoe wed be able to handle a all new version remake or sequel: zeds dead baby ... wait no hes back as a zombie :-
