its strange in the last few years whenever ive watched a movie ive been counting the minutes even if im enjoying it has seemed like a task too some extent and i was aware of it boyhood was different at the risk of sounded pretentious it seemed like it was a version of my own memories linklater obviously played on this whether intentional or not it was there he manages to tap into your own life and make this film seem like you are the only person who is ever going to see this movie and its all for you which is am amazing feat im not sure whether ive ever felt this way about a film before i found myself coming to tears at points which werent even sad partsthe whole thing seemed like i was living out a life a strange and abstract version of my own even though the story of my life is a million miles away from masons i cant recommend this film enough the runtime just breezed by and i didnt want it to end i felt like i could have watched masons story for another 12 years simply breathtaking one of the greatest achievements in cinema
