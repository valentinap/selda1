peter jackson delves deep into the works of tolkien to bring to life the emotions of the denizens of middle earth. the three hours and eleven minutes of the movie leaves the watcher gasping hoping yearning at the end you dont want it to end and you are left with a sence of serenity and peace. it is a must see movie for all who love tolkien and the lord of the rings series.
