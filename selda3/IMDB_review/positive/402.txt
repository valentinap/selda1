the shawshank redemption came out in 1994 and was an absolute flop but found its real audience in home video peaking as the most rented video of 1995 in the usa. a wonderful film that takes you into the prison experience of redmorgan freeman and andy tim robbins. andy being a banker convicted of murder and red a murderer already serving time this movie takes you to the limits of human endurance where the human spirit eventually prevails. the tsr takes you on an emotional journey that you will remember for a long time thanks to the superb crafting of the film and sincere performances by the cast. the  is deep and haunting this film is for the ages and will permenantly have a place in my heart. to me it is the best film of the 90s and quite possibly one of the best of all time. the fact that this film is sitting at no.2 is a testament to just how many people love this film many viewers seem to have an emotional bond with the film and i dont blame them. i only wish that i could view the film for the first time again and experience that redeeming feeling andy and red experienced at the end. ignore the hype surrounding the film and judge it on your own experience the last half hour are especially beautiful. watch this if you already havent and enjoy the masterpiece that frank darabont has so gracefully given us the privilege of viewing. 10/10
