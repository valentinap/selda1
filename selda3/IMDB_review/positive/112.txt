well what can i say. this makes batman begins seem terrible. christian bales batman/bruce wayne is on top form and better than everespecially with the scene involving the jump off the ifs in hong kong. i would hugely recommend that you watch this film. ive seen hundreds of films and in my opinion this is the best of them all. heath ledgers joker was fantastic. he brought humour and action to the whole film. i must say that ledgers joker has to be better than nicholsons 1989 portrayal however the jokes were not of the same calibre. anyway this film had it all - the action - the jokes. the storyline was great. it showed the jokers rise to power and it had plenty of action to help. especially with the party crash scene the street scene where the tumbler explodes : but there is a surprise at this point and when gotham general hospital has some structural re-modifications  gets blown up. the ending lacked a bit of fight from both batman and the joker and both should have suffered a few more cuts and bruises. anyway the whole film was brilliant and a must see for all movie lovers. absolutely brilliant film that balances -suspense- action - laughter and adventure. absolutely brilliant just like the cast and the director. what more can i say
