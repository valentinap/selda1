keeping the high standards set in the first two parts and upping the ante in terms of detailed action sequences and effects - but never disappearing up its own arse like those god-awful matrix sequels. this is sheer stunning edge-of-your-seat cinema that demands to be experienced on a very big screen. i appreciated the gradual coming down as this film - and the epic series - concludes. its button-pushingly emotional - but rightly so weve been through one hell of an adventure. i stayed to listen to annie lennox sing and to view the names of all the cast and crew whove done their very best to make this tale a reality. they deserve utmost praise and sincere gratitude. kudos too to christopher lee - who may not have made the initial theatre-release cut but who was none the less there in spirit. im hoping the extended dvd will include his contributions.
