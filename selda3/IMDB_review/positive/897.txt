im not going to waste your time by writing a long review. i have a couple of short words for you guys. this movie was truly amazing. i loved it from beginning to end. christopher nolan created the best batman there has been to date. heath ledger definitely made a amazing character. there has never been a better joker in all of history in my opinion. christian bale as the batman was the perfect. i loved it. the action sequences were so realistic that i actually thought batman could really exist. christopher nolan made this film very realistic indeed. everything in the movie seems possible in real life.
