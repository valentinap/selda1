the greatest movie of all time everything was great. if you are a true batman fan you must watch. the whole trilogy are wonder full just wish christian bale would come out in the man of steel sequel.people had doubts about heath ledger but i believe he nailed it. i always recommend this movie too people who havent seen it.i think chris nolan and zack snyder make a great team and should diffidently keep going for more hits. possibly make a justice league in the future great storyline .... just sad to hear about heath ledger his performance we be remembered.if you like this film i also recommend the dark knight rises tom hardy also does a great performance. great job to all
