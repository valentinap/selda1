the story of cinderella can be traced back to early egypt china france germany and many other countries from around the world the most wellknown versions were written by charles perrault cendrillon and by the brothers grimm aschenputtel there have been countless film television and stage adaptations of the iconic story but the most wellknown adaptation is walt disneys 1950 animated film i first fell in love with walt disneys animated film when i was just threeyearsold it was actually the first disney film that i ever saw as a child i can still remember being captivated by the story and singing along with the songs it was as though a spell had been cast upon me but the magic never wore off at midnight there were no words to describe the level of excitement i had when i first found out that disney was developing a liveaction film of the timeless story tonight i had the opportunity to attend an advance screening of the upcoming liveaction version of walts most beloved animated film what i enjoyed most about the latest animation to liveaction treatment is that its a relatively straightforward telling of the iconic story while alice in wonderland and maleficent were reimaginings cinderella is retold respectfully for the new generation lily james cinderella and richard madden prince charming were rightfully chosen for their iconic roles lily truly captured the true essence of cinderellas charm and beauty richard those eyes ahem was truly charming in every sense of the word i loved the chemistry between the prince and cinderella  i dont think ive seen such chemistry between two characters in a disney film for a very long time its very refreshing to see a fairy tale romance blossom cate blanchett lady tremaine and helena bonham carter fairy godmother were perfectly cast for their respective roles cate not only brought a lot of depth to her character but you could tell she was enjoying the role as the malicious stepmother helena not only brought a bit of comic relief to the film but she was definitely fun to watch  although you cant help but wonder if mrs weasley actually zapped bellatrix lestrange into a parallel universe hmm? i personally believe that disney made the right decision to hire kenneth barangh to direct the film and chris weitz to write the screenplay as i was watching the film on the big screen tonight i could tell that they both approached the story with deep understanding and most importantly respect i was genuinely relieved that it wasnt ruined by some unnecessary dark and edgy plot twist phew i absolutely loved patrick doyles  for the film and found it to be quite fitting with the story it was perfectly timed and it drew you into the fairy tale world i will definitely buy the soundtrack when its released next month sandy powells costumes though silly at times were excellent i dont think ive seen such beautiful designs in one film since the golden age of hollywood i genuinely hope sandy will be nominated for an oscar for those stunning costumes bravo the film itself is a visual marvel  especially for the fairy tale genre i was truly swept away by the lavish sets that were designed by dante ferretti i dont think ive seen such a breathtaking production since the late 1930s the special effects were equally breathtaking with the dress transformation and the carriagetopumpkin scenes being two of my favourite visual highlights im genuinely happy that disney kept the magic alive in this film very impressive my only disappointment was the running time of the theatrical cut i personally believe that it should have been 10 minutes or 15 minutes longer to flesh out the story more the film flowed smoothly and didnt feel rushed but there were a number of scenes and dialogue that were unfortunately left on the cutting room floor hopefully disney will release an extended cut or include those deleted scenes on the home media release you hear me disney? despite my issue with the running time i genuinely believe that disney did something right with their latest liveaction film while most people were probably expecting a swordwielding action hero im happy that disney treated their most beloved character with the uttermost care and respect the story of cinderella is very personal to each person who has felt like the underdog but managed to rise like a phoenix from the ashes in the end if walt disney were alive today im sure he would be proud to see his most treasured little savior be retold to the new generation in a beautiful and charming way bravo
