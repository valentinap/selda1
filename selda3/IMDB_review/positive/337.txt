this film is a classic and its the dialogue that really clinches it for me - sharp snappy humorous and delivered at a break neck speed - so much so that the subtleness of it requires you to re-watch the film time and again by now ive seen this film 15 or so times and new things still pop up i wont go over the context or the plot of the film as this is well covered by previous comments - needless to say you can download the script from the net and it literally jumps out at you its an incredible read now if the script is that good no wonder travolta and keitel wanted to do it an awesome film - the no1 film ever made in my estimation
