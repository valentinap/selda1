occasionally you go into a cinema and all the films you wanted to see were full. as youve come this far and youre a bit of a film fan you go to see a film youve heard nothing about. i did this 6 years ago with expectations low and a boredom threshold to match i sat and waited to be disappointed. 2 hours later i walked out of the cinema a different person before i had not been moved by a film i didnt care if : indiana jones made it sonny corleone got wacked fred married ginger et got home. before films were either plot driven or character driven they were action or comedy sad or happy a few came along that combined a number of facets that i enjoyed respected or challenged how i viewed an issue or a person. shawshank was different there were characters i believed not just one or two but virtually all. throughout the first hour i was gripped the full range of emotions were explored the second hour building on the characters was even more powerful some characters came and went but ultimately this was a story of 2 people: red and andy. i have never seen a film that so eloquently and beautifully illustrates friendship and hope. this has become the benchmark by which i judge all movies. i am pleased that i am not alone in feeling this way. i am glad that it did not win oscars as i feel individual endorsement is stronger than any vested interest award ceremony i relish telling everyone this is my favourite film. i have seen it many times and will see it many more.
