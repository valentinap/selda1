this is the only movie i would give 10 out of 10 for. this movie has got everything a movie needs: great acting and great actors an amazing storyline superb music a perfect movie length and a fantastic ending. this movie deserves all the credit it gets. it is my favourite movie of all time and always will be. this movie has changed my life.  while it doesnt have the innocence of reservoir dogs or the maneuverability of the kill bill series it definitely stands on its own. it is also one of the more charming and highly appealing of the generation x stoner flicks. let me just say that if i could give this movie beyonder points id give it a 16 for eerily supernatural. great great work.
