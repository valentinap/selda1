the shawshank redemption is one of the most touching and greatest movies i have ever seen. the movie is based on the novella rita hayworth and the shawshank redemption by stephen king. unlike most of his novels king didnt write a horror story but instead a inspiring tale of hope in unlikely places. overseeing the transition from book to big screen is frank darabont who in his director debut s a home run with this movie. not only does the plot pull you in but the actors do as well. tim robbins and morgan freeman do a fantastic job as the 2 central characters and as friends. bob gunton is great in the part of the villain as the evil warden. the directing cast and plot all combine to make the movie awesome. the plot of the movie revolves around andy dufresne a man who is imprisoned for life for a crime he did not commit. over time andy becomes friends with red an inmate who runs the business of smuggling in things into the prison. the story then follows the 2 and how they handle prison life. years go by but andy continues to speak of hope. ultimately andy will commit unbelievable acts in a touching story that is truly inspirational. the message the story delivers is to never give up hoping. the climax of the movie is fantastic and the ending is one of the greatest in film history. overall the shawshank redemption remains one of the greatest films of all time.
