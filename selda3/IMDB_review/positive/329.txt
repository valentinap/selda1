this film is phenomenal easily top 5 or even the best film of all time it is rare for me to feel happy while watching a film but when i watch this movie i feel happy i listen to every word and feel completely immersed in every thing that is happening it is shocking that this film only won one oscar very frustrating to even think about it but most people seem to agree this is much better than forrest gump i feel myself hating that movie for these reasons samuel l jackson should have won an oscar his performance is incredible i hang on every word he says he also has a lot of memorable lines the characters in this film act so well together that it doesnt even seem like their acting but are instead meaning it the soundtrack couldnt have been any better it is perfect tarantinos talent is displayed in full view here at the top of his abilities this film is not serious it is more relaxed and entertaining but done so well you take it seriously if that makes sense i rarely have strong feelings for most films but this film is different than most films different in way that is more well done than most films that go by the rules/guidelines this film is tied with the good the bad and the ugly for the best film of all time no film will ever be like pulp fiction ever again unless they copy it that says a lot id recommend this film to anyone everybody needs to see this film it is the best of tarantinos masterpieces i cant believe people cry about this films success 1 star ratings by people that cant handle this film
