i was overwhelmed by this film. i felt like an evil little wormtongue when i saw the amazing battles and the amazing every thing. i cried like a little baby throughout the entire film. the energy is splendid for this film. this movie does it for me. i have to say that the lord of the rings trilogy to me is what the star wars trilogy is to my parents. i am proud to say look at this amazing epic in my generation. this is a giant step in the right direction for epic movie making. on a scale of 1-10 i give it a 15. mad crazy and awesome. great job crew and cast of lord of the rings.
