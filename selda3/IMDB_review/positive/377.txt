the story as a whole is incredibly done everything from the camera work to the choice of words used. i also love how each character is so unique and well developed. so many small adjustments are made throughout the film to the characters make up for example which makes this such a well finished film. i highly recommend this to anyone who wants a brilliant film. 10/10. side note this is my only 10/10 film it is an emotional and thrilling film which has many plot twists. i feel like this is one of the greatest movies every made and i have many good reasons to think this. -sean
