the return of the king is the spectacular finale to the already fantastic first two movies in the lord of the rings trilogy. this one is the best. aragorn takes the lead role this time as he faces his destiny to become the king of gondor. gollum motion-captured andy serkis is becoming a big problem for sam sean astin as frodo is beginning to trust the creature more than sam himself. and pippin billy boyd pledges his allegiance to denethor john noble the crabby and evil stand-in leader of gondor. denethor doesnt have the best attitude in the world such as when he tries to burn his own son alive. the ending is very long but it isnt bad. the entire movie is riveting magical cinema and i ate up every minute of it. the return of the king is a masterpiece and of course it grossed hundreds of millions no doubt more than that actually. 4/4
