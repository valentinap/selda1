weve been subjected to enormous amounts of hype and marketing for the dark knight. weve seen joker scavenger hunts and one of the largest viral campaigns in advertising history and it culminates with the actual release of the movie. everything thats been said is pretty much spot on. this is the first time i can remember where a summer blockbuster film far surpasses the hype. for as much action as there is in this movie its the acting that makes it a great piece of work. between all the punches explosions and stunt-work is some great dialog work. all the actors have their moments. bales batman is the definitive batman because we see everything in this character finally on film. martial arts skills cunning great tactical thinking forensic application technological genius to advance or improve luscious foxs inventions/technological breakthroughs intimidating personality and even a little swashbuckling. as for heath yes he gets credit for his performance as the joker. but you have to also recognize jonathan and chris nolan for the writing and treatment of the character. its not just the fact that ledger makes the joker so menacing but the nolans have given the character this great manifesto that drives its actions. the jokers stance on chaos order anarchy the morality of the average modern human being make the character so interesting psychologically. the nolans drafted a complex character and only a perfect performance couldve pulled something like this off. thats how difficult of a role this was and thats why ledgers performance is so great. this isnt an action movie. its a film that explores literary themes of the hero and villain as well as order and anarchy. yes listen to the dialog because its all in there.
