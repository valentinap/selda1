i was reluctant to see this movie - thought it was just another prison movie - and i was certainly tired of mindless violence. i was channel surfing one evening - and stumbled across this movie. i watched a few minutes thinking i would change channels at the first commercial. almost 2 hours later - after seeing the end - i sat there...saying wow. that was a great movie. i have since recommended it to friends and family...it has grown in popularity due to word of mouth - and certainly deserves its spot at the top. morgan freeman put on a masterful performance as did tim robbins. the way their friendship develops and the interplay with the other inmates - a wonderful story. if you have not watched this movie yet - put preconceived notions aside sit down and enjoy the journey
