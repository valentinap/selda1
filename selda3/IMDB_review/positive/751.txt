many people i know havent yet seen this film put off by the comic book aspect. batman im not really into that its for kids isnt it wrong forget the genre this is a timeless masterpiece. unlike a lot of recent superhero movies including batman begins this doesnt waste time with how they gained their powers what their backstory is a love interest distraction etc. it starts with batman and ends with batman. the film grips you from the very beginning and takes you on a mesmerising roller-coaster of tense action and drama. whilst there is a grand finale of sorts the brilliant spirit of human race boat scene you could pick 4 or 5 different scenes from the film which all could have merited any films climax. take for example the attempted shooting of the major scene batmans dilemma of who to save between harvey dent and rachel the hospital exploding etc. quite frankly the film leaves you physically exhausted. heath ledgers joker is also one of the most brutally savage badies in movie history. savage in the sense that he has no super power no physical strength of skill but has the mind of a genius. when he talks you start thinking hold up why do i want this guy to succeed its a thriller with no filla i can never pull that phrase off
