the movie gone girl is about a man named nick dunne whose wife amy is missing on their fifth wedding anniversary then a while later they suspect that nick dunne killed his wife the movie is excellent and oscar worthy especially for rosamund pike and david fincher the movie is the best thriller of all time in my opinion it grabs your attention thanks to screenwriter and author gilliam flynn the movie has a great cast with a brilliant story that is suspenseful the theme of the movie is dark and creepy to intense more people throughout the movie this movie should be number 1 of the top 250 movies of all time it at least needs to get to 9510
