this movie has everything great actors fun action and awesome dialogue. the only thing this movie is missing is a theme which in my opinion adds to the fact that this movie rocked my world. you dont have to think too much about it it may take you a few times to watch it to appreciate it though. the first time i watched this movie the only thing i was thinking when it was over was whatttt the second time i watched it it turned into my favorite movie. i really cant explain why i like the movie so much it just sort of stuck with me. john travolta and sam jackson are incredible they show what hit men talk about when they arent killing people. uma thurman is cheezy and perfect for her role as the hit mens bosss wife. simply put this movie is incredible but it may take you two viewings. ten stars from me.  pulp is a throwback to those crime cereals that were so prolific in newspapers and comic books of the 70s as well as a throwback to the classic mobster movies many of us grew up with. some people see this as a weakness to quentin tarantinos direction saying that hes limited to only making homages to other things in popular culture. i dont think thats true personally but in my opinion its one of his strengths. he takes a genera that is well known and popular and gives it a very fresh twist. he did that with pulp and he continues to do it today with films like kill bill and inglourious basterds. boiling pulp fiction itself down however the true lovers of cinema the people who will know exactly what tarantino is referencing or paying homage to are the ones who will get the most out of this film. that is however not to say that casual viewers wont like the film. it has a little something for everybody and is without a doubt one of the best films of the recent generation. i hope you like this review and take it into consideration if you decide to see the film.
