in these times where an every man for himself mentality prevails and ones self worth is measured by possessions this movie reminds us that the escalating fear that we all have as this country spirals out of control is best abated by having someone you can call a true friend. as time passes and more of us see that this country is heading inexorably toward social political and economic disaster this movie will find an even larger audience of devotees. perhaps one day we will abandon our materialism and discover that true hope which we will desperately need and a major theme of this movie lies in our relationships with others. until then we will have the shawshank redemption to remind us what real friendship looks like.
