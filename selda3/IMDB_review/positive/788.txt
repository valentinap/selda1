ive seen this film on imdb so many times before on so many peoples lists. but i just ignored it because i thought it was not what i was looking for. when i finally decided to see it i immediately regretted not watching it any sooner. the film is heartbreaking and frustrating from the start but in the end you would truly feel redemption. you could feel the pain and injustice brought upon andy the protagonist. as i watched the movie i felt as if i was in prison with him  we get guy ritchie and jeremy clarkson. travolta and samuel l jackson play vincent and jules a couple of bantering hit men working for marsellus ving rhames who is highly protective of his wife mia uma thurman and about to conclude a payday from a fixed boxing match  marselluss fighter butch bruce willis is haunted by a childhood encounter with his late fathers best friend a jaw-dropping cameo from christopher walken. everyones destiny plays out with that of a couple of freaky stick-up artists played by amanda plummer and tim roth. in 1994 all the talk was of former video-store clerk tarantinos indifference to traditional culture. that patronised his sophisticated cinephilia and in fact 20 years on the writerly influences of edward bunker elmore leonard and jim thompson seem very prominent. don delillo began the 90s by warning that the us is the only country in the world with funny violence. maybe pulp fiction was the kind of thing he had in mind. unmissable.
