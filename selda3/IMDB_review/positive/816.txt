its easy to say that lotr: the return of the king has the most interaction of frodo baggins and samwise gamgee of all the lotr movies. a result of that is you get to really see the great chemistry exhibited by these two actors working together. this is the best of all the lotr movies in my opinion the way all the stories tie together just works to perfection. finally you can see aragorn taking his rightful place as the new king. when frodo finally gets to mordor and throws the ring into the pits of it is an extremely well done scene. this is probably the longest single movie not counting the godfather movies ive ever seen but it entertains from start to finish.
