this movie was the best in the series simply because of heath ledgers rip fabulous performance. his portrayal of the evil mastermind joker was simply faultless. the other actors were good as well. even though in batman 3 batman met a more powerful foe in bane in this movie he met a villain with a brilliant mind in joker. also harvey dents transformation in two-face was nice he kept his coin tossing thing which i like in particular about him. he used his mind to catch criminals but from now on he will use his brain to be a great foe for our hero batman. i strongly recommend this movie for those who like this genre of movies inspired by comic books.
