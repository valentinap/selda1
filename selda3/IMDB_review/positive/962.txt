i was blown away when i first saw the dark knight. it is better then batman begins and is one of my most favorite movies. i am glad heath ledger was nominated but the dark knight should have been nominated for best picture. heath ledger was very capable at playing the joker. i like the scene where he killed the gangster with a pencil. aaron eckhart was great at playing two-face and did better then tommy lee jones did in batman forever. he was evil but i felt bad for him. i liked the hospital confrontation between the joker where he used his coin and spared jokers life. theres only one bad part of dark knight. i liked the final battle between batman and the joker but after he was captured for good they did not show him in arkham asylum. i think maggie gyllenhall did better than katie holmes and i liked her scene with the joker. christian bale gave an oscar worthy performance and he had improved since batman begins. i also liked when lucius fox referenced catwoman. i cant wait to see the dark knight rises. i am kind of glad that bane is one of the villains. hes not that well known but he is famous for breaking the bat. if heath ledger had not died he would have been in dark knight rises. he would have teamed with bane. everyone should see the dark knight because it is an excellent film.
