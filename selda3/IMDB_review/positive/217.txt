this movie is just beyond great. everything about it was pitch perfect. the acting was fantastic especially from ledger and bale . bale and ledger just worked so well together in the scenes that they were in. ledger was the perfect joker. he had the ability to be as dark as the people wanted to see from joker he had the voice the tone and the look of joker. he was able to bring the best out of everyone that he was in a scene with and that is what made him a true highlight of the movie. it will be very hard to find someone that can portray joker quite like him. now on to bale. christian bale was as good of a batman as one can be. not only was he great as batman but also as bruce wayne. bale was the best bruce wayne that i have seen in my time of being a batman fan  which is a very long time . now i know that some might disagree with that but im sticking to my statement. the next reboot of batman will have a lot of pressure to top not just this trilogy but just this movie.
