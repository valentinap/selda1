the shawshank redemption is a magnificent tale of friendship and hope. led by great acting all around it is a almost flawless movie. morgan freeman is at his best in this film. this has been my favorite movie since i was a teenager and i think its going to last a while. the movie as a whole is incredible but the ending is what made the movie my favorite. after watching shawshank i was unable to think for several hours. the movie put me in a trance that consisted of me just taking in what i have watched. i have never witnessed such an incredible ending to anything in the movie industry. a must see for anyone who enjoys a good movie i promise it will not disappoint.
