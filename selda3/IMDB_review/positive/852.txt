it couldnt be another better ending for this wonderful trilogy. all the work is fantastic but this third part of this story couldnt be better. congratulations to all the team. i had read the trilogys book before watching the film and i thought in a epic history that is how it has been i was not wrong. so the only more thing i can say is if there is someone that has not seen this film yet dont wait more. also i recommend the new trilogy based in the world of j.r.r. tolkien called the hobbit its awesome. perhaps one of the most important point to have made this film the best option it has been the choice of the environment. simply amazing.
