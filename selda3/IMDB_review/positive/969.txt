i took my daughter to see this film yesterday and we both absolutely loved it angelina jolie is perfect in the role she is quite stunning in real life but with the contact lenses and cheek bones added she looks incredible and acts the part of maleficent amazingly well the updated storyline of why maleficent curses aurora from the original disney film shooting it as a prequel is feasible and quite understandable when you watch this film lana del reys voice for the song title is also beautiful and haunting i cant stop playing the theme tune i shall be taking a friend to see the film again a fantastic fantasy film and stay to the credits at the end to hear the song
