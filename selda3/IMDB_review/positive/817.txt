its easy to create an action movie based on big guns big men screaming and big name actors not this movie this movie had a style all of its own it was fresh fun and exhilarating something that this movie does differently than other action films is actually use the camera in its advantage instead of having the camera be something to put on a tripod while waiting for the special effects to happen the camera is used to portray fluid motion you can see every punch gunshot and stab easily and the camera compliments them perfectly if i were to complain about something it would be the characters i feel that the characters werent anything special and they all seemed to be the same person played by a different actor however that doesnt necessarily matter for what they lack in characters they succeed in a surprisingly interesting story the antagonist wasnt the runofthemill mad man who wants to take over the world the antagonist had solid reasons for what hes doing and the film explains it fairly well essentially this was a very fun movie and i highly suggest it if youre in the mood for a brand new type of action movie
