im in my 20s and its been a long time since ive actually enjoyed watching a fairytale cinderella helped me fall in love with fairy tales again i actually think that now as an adult i can appreciate fairy tales more than when i was a kid what i love most about the movie is that it promotes kindness and courage which may sound clich but in the movie we see that kindness attracts the right kind of people without kindness cinderella would have never attracted the prince that first day in the forest and she would have never attracted the fairy godmother if cinderella had become bitter and angry like her stepmother and stepsisters she would have not only made herself no better than them but she would have pushed away the prince and the fairy godmother and her life probably would have stayed the same or even worse she may have ended up just like her stepmother and step sisters i never realized it before but cinderella is more of a story about kindness and forgiveness although it is a romantic story too i think the romance element of the story is not the most important part of this story
