the return of the king is the third and final film in the lord of the rings saga. peter jacksons portrayal of the film is a masterpiece in an already stunning trilogy. rotk is an epic tale of sacrifice courage and friendship. frodo and sams journey to mount doom is scary and filled with heart breaking moments of triumph and defeat. elijah woods once again portrays frodo wonderfully as well as sean astin. the rest of the fellowship are very good in all of their scenes especially viggo mortenson and ian mckellan as gandalf. visually the cities and battles are simply fantastic and very realistic. this has been a long journey of film starting with the fellowship 2 years ago and now it has ended wonderfully.
