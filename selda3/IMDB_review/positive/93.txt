what do you get if you take all the garbage out of the low budget movies and glue it all together yep you guessed it - pulp fiction the ultimate movie of my generation. one could call it the bible for film freaks. if you didnt see it yet read no more just go and buy it or rent it whatever. and if you dont like it go see it again and again if necessary.
