while batman begins was all about batman the dark knight is all about the joker... the perfect villain as they sayperhaps there hasnt been any character so evil or any actor so perfectly portraying the evil. heath ledger has outdone all his previous performances with just this one role of his hope he were with us to give us more such enthralling performances. r.i.p. the movie is going to be remembered for ages to come but not because in the end the good wins over the evil but specifically for the evil. ledger according to me has done the best performance in a negative role in the decade. the director christopher nolan has lived up to his reputation that he created with the following kept up with memento the prestige insomnia and batman begins and looks like the young director to watch out for along with zack snyder and robert rodriguez.am anxiously waiting for his inception coming this year.
