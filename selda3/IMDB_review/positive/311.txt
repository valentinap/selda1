this is a very dark movie and heath ledgers joker is the darkest it gets. the entire movie is like an eerie roller coaster ride. theres not much cgi here only a truly haunting  and dashes of the jokers mesmerizing lines. the action is kept from being overblown and thats really encouraging in this era of mindless cgi-driven summer blockbusters. more importantly the story of bruce wayne is taken to new high or low. this is unlike any comic book movie you have ever seen one that youll keep coming back to. all of the actors deserve their kudos but ledger overshadows them all.
