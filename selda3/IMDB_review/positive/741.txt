mission impossible is a movie about a spy who must uncover a mole in his organization i really liked this movie it is extremely well written and albeit a little confusing but if you listen closely you should be able to follow it it has an incredible amount of suspense and intrigue and i would recommend it to anyone who is tired of the same formulaic bondtype movies the ending is probably my favorite in any movie and is well worth sitting through some of the dialoguebased scenes in the end there is nothing not to like about this movie if you find it confusing you are probably used to badly written movies this movie was not written for audiences and is not meant to be easy to understand it is more believable that way i think 910
