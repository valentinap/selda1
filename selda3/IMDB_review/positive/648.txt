peter jackson truly outdid himself with this instalment of the lord of the rings trilogy. this is the best of all three. better than the first two combined. the battle sequences and the action in this movie surpasses the action and battle sequences in the fellowship of the ring and the two towers. and you finally see why frodo baggins decided to go on the journey that he did and see gollums decent into madness from the one ring. after i saw this movie i was so overjoyed and it just blew me away and it kept my full attention all the way from beginning to end. i do not think any other fantasy movie can measure up to return of the king. the first two films almost measure up to this one. return of the king is a true masterpiece
