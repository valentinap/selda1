i think they did a good job with the last movie. often with in movie series the quality just sinks with each movie that comes out but with lord of the rings i really think they found a way to avoid that. i am a huge fan of the books and the films really was a good surprise where movie adaption of books usually disappoints i was really surprised. everything was just great not only with this movie but with all of them. music locations actors and dialog. peter jackson is a world class director and with these movies i really feels that he shows that. everything was great. recommend to check out the movies and would encourage everyone to try the books.
