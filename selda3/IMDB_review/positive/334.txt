this film is amazing because it has a great screen-play it is at the same time an excellent thriller and an intelligent comedy and we only can see it in a few brilliant movies a fabulous director quentin tarantino that had done other great movies like jackie brown or reservoir dogs and well actors and actresses mainly john travolta with the best movie of his career the incredible samuel l jackson and uma thurman i think the first and the last moments of the movie are only some of the best moments of cinema that i saw in my life i think its incredible how a great movie like pulp fiction didnt won the oscar of best movie of the year losing to the good but not excellent forrest gump pulp fiction isnt only one of the best movies of the 90s it is for me one of the best movies of ever
