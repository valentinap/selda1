in this quentin tarrantino written/directed film it follows three storys set over a few days and all collide together. warning i have given away lots of the story here so dont read on if you dont want to know the first story is where vincent vega john travolta who has just returned from amsterdam is escorting his boss marcellus wallaces ving rhames wife mia uma thurman out to dinner. followed by a twist dance an overdose at a drug dearlers house eric stoltz is the first story. the second story starts with a young child being told an amusing story by captain koons christopher walken about a gold watch the young child grows up to be butch coolige bruce willis who we see being bribed to go down in the fight earlier on he of course doesnt and gets invoved in a car accident a shoot out and being raped by z peter green along with marcellus. in the third story which is my favourite we return to where two hitmen vega and jules samuel l jackson shoot dead some gangsters have a mirical happen to them and have to dispose of a dead body in the back seat of a car with the help of jimmy tarrantino and mr wolf harvey keitel. they then at breakfast all this happens at around 8-10am have to deal with two resterauant robbers tim roth and amanda plummer who we see discussing robbing the resteraunt at the beggining of the movie. all in all a fabulous movie which is very confusing and you can get something new out of the movie each time. 11/10 its that good
