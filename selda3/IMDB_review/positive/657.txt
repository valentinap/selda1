people will have interesting reactions to this film all of matthew vaughns movies have been good and he was able to push it further with this one i would call it an action comedy but there is more of an emphasis on the action than the genre usually has there are cool pov shots and it gets you right into the thick of it it mixes it up with some short moments where it doesnt cut so quickly as well as a few long takes that are particular nice the violence and comedy has a guttural component which a person like me really enjoys but it will throw some off the film is a throwback to old spy flicks while at the same time being a sort of parody it is humorous throughout samuel l jackson plays an odd megalomaniac who makes you laugh more than shiver which goes with the tone of the movie it is nice to see samuel l in the role of a bad guy i have no doubt that many will enjoy the henchwoman who has a different element to her colin firth fits in with the particularly suave spying and the newcomer playing the protagonist taron egerton handles both the action and comedy well mark strong is always a good actor for movies with dark humor it is fun however those who are sensitive may have trouble enjoying it it is not a film for everyone but that makes it better for others i personally think it is vaughns best work 875
