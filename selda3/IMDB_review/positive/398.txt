the shawshank redemption is a movie about time patience and loyalty -- not sexy qualities perhaps but they grow on you during the subterranean progress of this story which is about how two men serving life sentences in prison become friends and find a way to fight off despair.the shawshank redemption is a brilliant film that is beautifully acted with and insbiring and uplifting message message of hope. in my opinion the film should have at least one oscar to show for its brilliance. it is truly sad that know one could see how superior shawshank is to the wearisome forest gump. i think that if shawshank had been released more recently it would have hands down won best picture it is one of the few films that are worthy of being called perfect
