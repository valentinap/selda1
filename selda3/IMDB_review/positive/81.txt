when batman begins was released in the year 2009 i watched it and wondered seeing the ending scene where the joker was revealed to be the villain in the next installment of the series that well how christopher nolan is gonna incorporate the funny playful and completely insane character of the joker in to his dark and serious version of batman.. so when i went to watch this movie i was ready to see the heath ledgers joker cracking some jokes blowing up lots of places killing tons of people going way beyond insane and of course laughing a lot.. but the joker i saw was rather just the opposite. he did blow up buildings he did kill people he did go insane and laugh but he did all of this with a motive and a touch of control and calmness to it.. its been a while since i have seen a movie where the villain shines more than the hero and in this movie heath ledgers joker completely stole the show. everything he does seems reasonable and the things that he says feels honest and true. the movie grips you throughout its 152min runtime. christopher nolan nailed it and showed how comic book characters can be taken out of their colorful world put them in a dark and serious movie and make it work.. other actors also played their part well christian bale was good as batman/bruce wayne aaron eckhart was brilliant as harvey dent gary oldman maggie gyllenhaal michael caine and morgan freeman played their roles beautifully. this movie is one of my favourite movies of all time for those of you who havent watched it yet i recommend you watch it as soon as possible because this kind of gems come rarely..
