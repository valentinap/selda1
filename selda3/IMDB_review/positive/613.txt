pulp fiction is one of those movies that gets to you every time you watch it. this film is hands down one of the greatest icons in the film industry. it structures out a plot through different stories at different occasions and brings a one line connection throughout the whole story. tarantino is not only my favorite film director but one of the most skilled at what he does. he provides an edgy plot with violence and references that happen in real life. although pulp fiction may be far fetched from actual reality but it still is a realistic fiction piece. the characters are well formed and controversial and has distinct personalities throughout. this film is by far my favorite and one of the most well written pieces the world has seen.
