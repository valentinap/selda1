the lord of the rings: return of the king is a striking powerful and beautiful film with an amazing storyline. this is the final journey for the fellowship of the ring to complete their mission through battle passion and love. i believe in this film this is where the true relationships of the characters start to form and become strong and meaningful. without spoiling the film for you i will now talk about the soundtrack. for me the soundtrack is at the heart of this film. it is filled with so much emotion i even get teary when listening to it. a brilliant soundtrack along with an amazing story means you get an excellent film. i definitely recommend everyone to watch this although this film requires full concentration so perhaps only watch it when you have time to get the best experience.
