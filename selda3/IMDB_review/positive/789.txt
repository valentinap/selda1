ive seen this film many times before  and every time i watch it it just seems to get better there really is nothing bad i have to say about this film  because the overlying message of the film is infinite  and its just such a timeless classic . i cant imagine the movie without tim robbins and morgan freeman in their respective roles so bravo to them  because ultimately these two characters are the heart of the story. while there are some scenes that truly stand out to me  you just need to do yourself a favour a watch this amazing film. its one of the best of all time and i can promise you that you will enjoy it
