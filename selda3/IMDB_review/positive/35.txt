with all of the talk about heath ledger getting an oscar i feel that it is only right to state that that was not him. arkham mustve given the joker an early parole to appear here because for all accounts that was the joker i saw on screen as this was the most realistic portrayal of my favorite villain that i have ever seen. it has been a long time since i have clapped at the end of a movie but it seems i was not alone as most of the packed audience i was viewing with had to agree. this has to be considered one of the best movies of the year the scope and vistas were spectacular and this was batmans against the joker in a tour de force effort that both the writer and producer should be proud of
