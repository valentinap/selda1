so this movie contains the best acting roles in the respective careers of john travolta samluel jackson uma thurman and bruce willis on top of that and maybe in support of that it has the best dialog ever seen in a movie what more do people want this is a masterpiece in a totally different category than anything tarrantino released before or after and people who dont like excessive violence more than 10000 people are shot to death each year in the states so really open your eyes it is not like this comes from nothing this movie is completely realistic in that aspect
