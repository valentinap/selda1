its my favorite movie not only because tarantino is a genius but because it have a lot of the greatest actors in it and is a complete masterpiece with violence blood bad words love and everything you want in a movie it is the best tarantino film for sure. usually i ask myself why does anybody make a movie like this it would be the best thing happening.because the movies we see today are almost all bad. so if you want to watch a great movie if you like action if you like gun shots if you like blood if you like black humor if you like john travolta uma thurman bruce willis tim roth if you like samuel l. jackson and if you like quentin tarantino and if you have not watched this movie yet go ahead and watch it.
