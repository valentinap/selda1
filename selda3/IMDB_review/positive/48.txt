where do i start when i first heard of the shawshank redemption i immediately wanted to watch it mostly of its title so as i always do i looked it up on imdb and looked at the rating. it was the highest ranked movie on imdb and of course i would give it a go. the beginning was very interesting with andy being convicted of double homicide and seeing the lean-back of what happened. him being found guilty serving two life sentences in the toughest prison in america shawshank. i thought it would be another overrated boring movie like the godfather but no it caught my attention from the start and never lost it either. the dramatic scenes it gives you a glance of how it is in prison the emotional scenes. it is all a masterpiece there is a reason to why it is the best movie i have ever watched and probably will ever watch. the amazing acting plot and moderate length. the last scene with red walking up the beach towards andy and the credits slowly rolling in it makes you beg for it to never end. when it comes to movies i can sometimes get a little emotional if its a good movie which shawshank is. it definitely deserves the spot as #1 i cannot understand how it didnt win an oscar. i really recommend this movie to anyone who wants a good weekend but get a load of potato chips and soda since you will finish it all up very fast.
