this is the best movie i have ever seen. in a way i feel i am in a prison of life myself. restricted to doing certain things. sometimes i get frustrated and feel as i should runaway to some place where i could feel free. i hope and dream for it sometime. this movie just reminds me of my feelings so much. i love andy dufresne most in this movie. although critics say tim robbins didnt do enough to express the character but my personal opinion is that he was made for this role. i can go on and say more but i said the most important thing which i feel whenever i watch it. i am glad to visit imdb. i never heard of it before. some 7 years ago i saw it at no.2 in the rankings and decided to watch it immediately. only other movie which even comes close to this is citizen kane. but that is about past and this one is about hope and freedom. i give it 11/10.
