quentin tarantino has one the most brilliant minds ever not only does he make great movies but he always finds a way to keep you interested in whatever it is that going on exception jackie brown which is a review ill save for a day when i have time to complain about how awful it was so as i was saying tarantino is a brilliant and i think the way he lays the story out in this particular movies couldnt have been any better he had the perfect cast to pull of what i believe to be the best movie of that particular year i honestly thought when i first saw this film that samuel l jackson and john travolta were going to be a horrible match side by side but the scenes with those two are what made me love the movie so much willis and rhames scenes were great too the situation they were in was kinda effed up but none the less entertaining the only time i lost any interest in this movie was when uma thurman had her moment of glory but when she overdosed it kinda pulled me back into what was going on weird i know but back to my point the movie was great and i give it a 10/10 i know this isnt a great review but im not good at this kind of stuff so bite me
