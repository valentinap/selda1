pulp fiction has everything that you can want from a movie: a great story with great characters great actors a great director & 2 hours and 40 minutes of film that keeps you glued to the screen. quentin tarantino brilliantly weaves together 3 stories to make a film that is a true masterpiece. the dialogue is truly excellent and the acting from samuel l. jackson john travolta uma thurman bruce willis ving rhames and many others is outstanding. i highly recommend this film and give it 10/10 stars.
