if you liked this movie see true romance written by quentin but directed by tony scott what can you say about pulp fiction one of the finest films and most influencial a masterpiece in time study and dialogue such real characters that it makes my head spin i hope he does another writing credit soon cause no one else writes dialogue like quentin its one of the best ever period  we get guy ritchie and jeremy clarkson travolta and samuel l jackson play vincent and jules a couple of bantering hit men working for marsellus ving rhames who is highly protective of his wife mia uma thurman and about to conclude a payday from a fixed boxing match  marselluss fighter butch bruce willis is haunted by a childhood encounter with his late fathers best friend a jaw-dropping cameo from christopher walken everyones destiny plays out with that of a couple of freaky stick-up artists played by amanda plummer and tim roth in 1994 all the talk was of former video-store clerk tarantinos indifference to traditional culture that patronised his sophisticated cinephilia and in fact 20 years on the writerly influences of edward bunker elmore leonard and jim thompson seem very prominent don delillo began the 90s by warning that the us is the only country in the world with funny violence maybe pulp fiction was the kind of thing he had in mind unmissable
