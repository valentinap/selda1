the shawshank redemption should be played throughout the world in all schools to teach people the hard life of prison but the bond between friends and the idea of hope. morgan freeman is a second to none actor he lays the role perfectly and i could not think what the film would be like without him. all the other actors perform perfectly. this movie is a movie of inspiration and one of which will get people through harsh times. this film always restores my faith in mankind i simply love it. i first saw this film sitting on my brothers desk and i was intrigued by the idea of a film set in prison where hope and other morale values were the storyline instead of violence and havoc this is a amazing film which brings pride to the actors and crew who produced it. the setting of the movie is one of perfection the gothic grounds and the stunning facilities astound me iam finding it hard to put in to words how much this film means to me i would say it is one of the greatest films ever made in my time and i love it.
