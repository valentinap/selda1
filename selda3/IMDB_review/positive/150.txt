truly a masterpiece. this film was more than worthy of its 11 oscars. the fellowship was stunning the two towers was inspiring but the return of the king was truly the greatest film i have ever seen. the thing that is most amazing about the return of the king is that it fills the jigsaw of its predeceors and does it with such epic granduer emotion and inspiration that i know very few people who were not amazed by it. i myself have read the lord of the rings by tolkien and in light of this can say that this film has to be one of the adaptations in recent times. peter jackson i feel simply could not have done a better job in using the beautiful new zealand landscape to portray tolkiens vision. without a doubt the speech roars and sheer numbers of the rohirrim at the pellennor charge in the sunset is truly the greatest sequence of film i have ever seen. people say the ending is too long i say it was perfect as it gave a heart felt and fitting deneaumont and ended a truly remarkable trilogy that will not be soon forgotten.
