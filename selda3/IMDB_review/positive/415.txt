the path of the rigtheous man... when you hear this im sure you still get the chills. the best 90s movie because of the plot because of the changes that tarantino made in the perception of time in films. because of the astonishing performances of everyone in the cast. because of the soundtrack... a movie that nobody will ever forget.
