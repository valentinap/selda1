wow christopher nolan created an absolutely amazing batman movie. i loved everything about the movie. batman was always my favorite superhero. i watched batman begins all the time as a kid and it became a favorite of mine. then i saw the dark knight in a movie theater when i was 7 or 8 and i was totally blown away by it. the dark knight was perfectly casted. christian bale made an incredible batman heath ledger as the joker was the best acting performance of all time and i doubt anyone will top it anytime soon. there were so many great scenes like the interrogation scene the chase scene the bank heist intro joker crashing the party joker exploding the hospital and jokers magic pencil trick. batman is the best superhero ever and the joker is the best super villain ever and the dark knight is the best movie sequel ever.
