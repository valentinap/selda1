this is one of those movies that you will end up watching again after a while and forget just how good it is i think they should start playing more reruns on the tv as far as the plot its a batman movie. if youve seen one you know what is going on. i think the main reason i enjoy this trilogy more than the others is because it seems to be darker grittier than the others if that makes sense.. the movie keeps you on the edge of your seat right from the beginning. i like all of the movies from this trilogy if i had to choose i would pick this one as the best although ... i will change my mind on occasion they are all really good. if you are looking for must watch movies i dont think you could go wrong with this. if you like it i suggest the rest i include this movie when suggesting movies to my friends all the time. enjoy p.s. - dont forget the popcorn
