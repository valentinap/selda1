well...lets just say im 12 years old...the first time i watched it i was 7 now i still watch it every single day. not many words can describe lord of the rings some of them maybe mesmerising unbeilevable...but for me it was pro bely the most effecting movie i have ever witnessed. when i watch it i always get goosebumps...always never once have i not been star struck by it. now to all of you tolkien haters out there who call lotr nerdy lets just say f*** you now honestly i recommend these movies to pretty much everyone. now i admit that there are too many endings6 to be precise but who honestly gives if you spend 5 years of your life loving this movie intensely no matter how many endings it has they will all make you cry.
