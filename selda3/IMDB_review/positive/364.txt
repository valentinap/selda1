their are a lot of films now a days that are just so bland and uninteresting. but this film comes to none of that every second of this movie is just so fascinating from the dialoge that some characters share or just the insanity of the situations that occurs. in my opinion this film is just about how crazy life can get and quentin tarintino takes it as far as possible. the acting is great in this movie but even if this movie had terrabel acting it wouldent matter because this dialog is jut so realistic that any one can pull it off. but overall this movie just fascinates me every time i see this movie theres something new i notice about it. ill see the camera do something ive never seen before or ill learn something new about the characters i didnt know before. its a wild ride from start to finish. i adore this movie to death
