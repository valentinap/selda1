if there was a rating higher than ten this is the only movie in the world that deserves it. i say this with all seriousness. i loved this movie. this movie has everything anyone could ever want. tolkien fans {i am one myself} and everyone else will not be disappointed. for the very few people left by now who havent seen this movie do so immediately :] lord of the rings is a beautiful work of literature and the movie comes near to matching its brilliance. in the short documentary entitled ringers lord of the fans someone says that the power of lord of the rings is almost spiritual and i agree. pete jackson definitely captured the magic of the books and you dont want to miss it.
