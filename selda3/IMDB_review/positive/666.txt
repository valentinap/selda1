one of the movies worth to watch always again and again....the movie entertains you from the very start to the very end.no matter how many times you watch the movie you would not feel bored at all. it is one of those kind of movies which makes a place in your mind as one of the best movies watched and worth to be watched again and again.a movie which is at a level which is very high.indeed the christopher nolan trio-logy makes the batman comic character look very good. christian bale is one the the best hollywood actor i have ever seen.. his acting as batman and bruce wayne is too good.heath ledger on the other hand definitely played the joker character too goodhe really scares the audience by his acting. this is one of the best movie made by christopher nolan and definitely for more movies from christopher nolan and jonathan nolan.
