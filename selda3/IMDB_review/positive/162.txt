this was the one movie i had been waiting for all year so i wasnt disappointed when i saw it yesterday. i knew that there were some important scenes cut from the movie but it didnt matter to me because i know they will be there in the extended version dvd set. it was fantastic to see aragorn become who he was born to be it was his courage and belief in frodo that inspired many of the others to continue on. i think anyone would want someone like sam to be their friend his friendship had more power than the ring itself. i honestly cant decide which of the three are my favourites because i love them all but this definitely is a trilogy that ill never forget.
