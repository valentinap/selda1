this is without a doubt one of my favorite films of all time ill never forget watching this film for the first time with a good buddy of mine afterward we couldnt stop talking about it and spent a great deal of time explaining plot points to each other we finally decided that we just had to see it again so we did and all of our questions were answered and our theories proven correct the story is nothing less than superb every time you think you have the movie figured out they throw you for another loop but not too much as to get you irritated trying to figure out the plot this is most definitely a film that deserves at least two viewings before you can truly understand and appreciate the story the characters are all excellent as well although i was sad to see jack harmen emilio estevez get killed off so quickly i liked his character the cast is extraordinary tom cruise plays ethan hunt perfectly jon voight was the perfect choice for jim phelps emmanuelle beart was very good in her role henry czerny was superb as kittridge jean reno was an excellent addition to the cast ving rhames was a very nice touch and really added a lot to the film kristin scott thomas was lovely as always although played a somewhat minor role in the greater scheme of things vanessa redgrave was another nice addition to the cast and finally emilio estevez as i mentioned above played a small role and played it quite well i can see why some of the big fans of the show wouldnt like this film due to certain plot points that i cant give away so if you are a big fan of the show be forewarned you may have some issues with the film personally ive never seen a single episode of the old television show so i had absolutely no frame of reference which i believe put me in a better position to appreciate the story i feel that i have to mention the action scenes in this film spectacular the scene where kittridge and hunt are talking in the restaurantjust awesome the entire last 20 minutes of the filmunbelievable the filming the action the special effects and stunts alone make this film worth watching but luckily there is so much more to appreciate if you are a fan of tom cruise or just crimemysteryaction films in general be sure to check this one out at least twice this is honestly one of my top 20 films of all time i truly hope that you will enjoy this film thanks for reading chris
