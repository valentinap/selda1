im a fan of david fincher movies like se7en 1995 the curious case of benjamin button 2008 the social network 2010 are top notch but im a big big fan of fight club and no movie of his has been this good but i think gone girl came pretty close though both movies are just little different but the twist is mind blower gone girl focuses on the dark side of domesticity that how a family can be this disturbed ill try no to spill any spoilers but ill tell you that the spoiler is revealed at the middle but the amazing thing is that it still hooks you to watch the rest and the ending i think cant be that good ben affleck as nick dunne was amazing but omg rosamund pike as amy dunne aka gone girl was brilliant excellent and marvelous i will only say this that she has the every right to win the academy since this is an adaption to gillian flynns book which she also writes the screenplay which i think was very clever from fincher to choose gillian for this job and she excellently done it the movie is very much to the book and everything goes as i hoped if you are choosing the movie to watch first its okay but read the book also its brilliant this is a mystery thriller movie and all the fans of this genre must watch this
