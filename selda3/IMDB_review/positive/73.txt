when i rented the movie i was doubtful whether to rent it or not. then i started watching it. from the very 1st moment i was kinda sure it wud be worthy watching this  the serious violence of american gangster movies crime movies and films noirs mixed up with the wacky violence of cartoons video games and japanese animation  and the fragmented story-telling structures of such experimental classics as citizen kane rashomon and la jet’©e. the oscar-winning script by tarantino and roger avary intertwines three stories featuring samuel l. jackson and john travolta in the role that single-handedly reignited his career as hit men who have philosophical interchanges on such topics as the french names for american fast food products  bruce willis as a boxer out of a 1940s b-movie  and such other stalwarts as harvey keitel tim roth christopher walken eric stoltz ving rhames and uma thurman whose dance sequence with travolta proved an instant classic.
