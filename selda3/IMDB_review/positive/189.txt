this movie rock. best super hero movie of all times maybe. the joker stole the entire show. hes like a savage tornado on gotham city and only batman can stop him. the joker is not the only bad ass in town. two face is also here to make the life of batman a living hell. this film is not only an action movie but also a psychological drama. never in a batman movie a director explore so deep the mind of a super hero. christopher nolan make a wonderful job. the choice of heath ledger was a little bit critical but his performance shut all the critic up. and aaron eckart is the best two face ever. ok its not tough to top the performance of the other but.
