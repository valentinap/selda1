pulp fiction is trully one of the best movies of the 90s its wondarfully made and entertaining from begining to end its not a standardly played movie instead its not in sequence and comes together at the end its trully ogininal the performances are also great my favorite being john travoltas if you havent seen this movie see it at once it will be a classic
