the simpler it was the better it became. the movie just showed me what i need to do in oder to become like him. thats how great the movie was. a real detective story minus the characters cape and horns. the movies complex plot was a product good understanding of a simple story. i like the way bruce wayne was portrayed a renewed man pretending to be a spoiled brat. this is just a good way to hide his true identity by being what people expect him to be. like the art of war when you are strong you pretend that you are weak. a true player of the system so he can continue with his work. the joker in this movie is just great evidence of great acting. when you begin to see the character and not the actor you begin to understand that heath did a great job on the joker. i remember the joker not heath. the movies theme and music became my last-song-syndrome great  by hans zimmer. the theme was really thought off and studied well understood the need of the story. all i can say is this is what great movies are all about.
