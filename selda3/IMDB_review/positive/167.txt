this was a reflection of the count of montecristo especially the jailbreak scene. but still i find it fascinating enough to impress me and have a lot of ingredient included in it. this is probably the most amazing movies from the nineties apart from forrestgump and back to the future and all. it also reminded me of the series the oz its cool and all but theres this mainstream way of showing jail and high school as the same in hollywood a lot. probably so but im afraid that not to be true.and one more thing i noticed was that viewers seems to be confused a number of times as the story slips from one another scene and is really complicated. that is it started as a man who have been betrayed by his love to whove been framed then jailed bitched from there and rules there becomes everyones favorite and the warden becomes his worst enemy and teaches him a lesson while he was on the go.
