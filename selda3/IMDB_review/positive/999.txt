i remember when i used to not like fantasy movies that much i thought what most people think. cheesy/unrealistic/weird/freaky...you get the point. when i saw the 1st film i changed my mind i found myslef not only liking it but i loved it. the characters grow on you and they are oustanding in the last film elijah woods performance of frodo was particularly good. these movies may seem childish to some people...but if you begin to accept it for all its magic battles and creatures you see something else. this isnt just a bunch of fancy words with wizards and fairy-tale creatures....its truly a wonderful story that is as real as anything. do yourself a favor watch these movies. youll be glad you did because the last one is truly amazing. ive yet to see a better film and i dont think i ever will.
