the dark knight in my opinion was the most remarkable action movie i have ever seen. the storyline action scenes make-up and actors make the movie feel like its not a movie at all. its real life. the storyline is creative and memorable. the beginning has a great hook and makes you suspicious. at first i found this movie to be kind of scary and dark only because im deathly afraid of clowns. but as the movie progressed i began to fall in love with it. the action scenes in this movie are so fantastic theres no word to describe it. the joker constantly comes up with new games and adventures. my favorite scene was when the joker was driving the truck and batman flipped it over. i have never seen anything like that
