the shawshank redemption is the best movie of all times according to over a million voters. when i saw this movie i was amazed because of the plot of this movie and that was something that made this movie so special. i also liked this movie very much because of the cast of this movie. tim robbins andy dufresne and morgan freeman ellis boyd red redding made one of the best performances of their life. deserves to be noted that bob gunton warden norton made an also good performance. i really recommend this movie to you and i am sure that you will love it because its a movie that can teach you many things about life and the relationships between people and friends.
