unlike previous letdowns this year return of the king was excellent. a perfect 10. coming in at 3 and a half hours the movie is really long...but until the last 20 minutes you really dont know. the plot acting effects and story keep people glued to their seat the entire time. sean astin deserve atleast a nod if the statue as best supporting actor oscar. elijah wood could recieve a nod for best actor. this movie will definately win best effects best musical  and could win best movie this year at the oscars. it was that good. you should go see it right now. stop staring at the computer screen and go. this movie is that good.
