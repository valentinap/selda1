mission impossible a 1996 film directed by brian de palma is a great film i do know others have found it jarring with a confusing storyline and i have to somewhat agree however there are many other elements which make this a very enjoyable film  first and foremost i love the cinematography  the tilted angles which shows how chaotic the situation that ethan hunt played by tom cruise is put in jim phelps played by jon voight expertly plays his mentor in an interesting role ving rhames stars as luther stickell the only other character besides ethan hunt who is in all 3 films so far emmanuelle beart as claire phelps also makes an appealing love interest the action sequences are topnotch especially the helicopter sequence at the end and the music is very fitting by master composer danny elfman i would recommend this film  a high 8 out of 10
