the return of the king is the best movie ever made to the best trilogy ever done. this movie deserved the eleven oscars it got including the editing. without the editing this movie wouldve been over four hours long. even though this movie is about three and a half hours it dies not feel like it. the scenes are intense and can tend to be emotional. gollum is the show-stealer again. as the ring is taking frodo away from strength gollum uses that to get the ring back eventually and drive sam away. it was kind of sad to see gollum die along with the ring in the fires of mt.doom. aragorn deserves to be king of gondor. he was amazing in this movieplayed by viggo mortensen. i am glad that legolas and gimli were used for comedy. with all the drama and action there needs to be a bit of comedy before the action overwhelms the movie. the acting is perfect. i liked most of the characters. it was sad when theoden died. he was great in this series. the music by howard shore is even better. you can hear some celtic tunes during some scenes. i loved the song into the west by annie lennox. the effects and the cgi is excellent especially during the battle scenes towards the end. peter jackson really put his name into the record books. this is the best fantasy epic in fact the best movie of all time. i rate this movie 15/10if the rating system went any higher.
