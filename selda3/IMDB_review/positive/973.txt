i think this movie is the best it had the best special effects ive ever seen also the best actors who played their role really well. it also had a great background music which i totally loved. this movie really deserved all the oscars they have won : all the scenes in the movie made a great representation of tolkiens stories. i definitely was captured all the landscapes in the movie new zealand rules if people havent seen it they should because its really entertaining. by now ive seen it like 20 times or so. the dialogue in the movie are really complex which made me think a little at least for me its good. everyone must at least see one of the 3 because they all are great.  he dares to go the next step in filmmaking and wins the audience over. due to the extreme amount of violence drugs language and sexuality i strongly advise the faint-hearted and children to keep way away from this movie. otherwise if you dont mind a bit of naughty fun and a huge exciting spark in your movie-life then see this now pulp fiction is definitely an experience you wont forget easily.
