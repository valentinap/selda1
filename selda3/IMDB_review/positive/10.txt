yes it is definitely one of my top ten films i have made the point in the past that if an alien came down to earth and didnt know what a film was that this would be what we should show them it is a masterpiece in storytelling and general entertainment it is split into eight short chapters each with their own strengths but none which manage to disappoint you can jump in at any point during the film and be entertained as it does not focus very heavily on story but rather portrays the perfect mix of action adventure comedy crime drama and lots lots more it has a universal appeal and had me personally on the edge of my seat watching it due to its phenomenal tension and suspense i could watch it 100 more times and would not get bored ive said it before and ill say it again: this is the perfect film
