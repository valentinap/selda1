i think my fan-boy mode has just kicked in. there are just so many good things about this movie i just... oh my god excuse me... i need a moment. the acting is excellent with the best performance coming from heath ledger the story is great the characters and the way they are portrayed are wonderful batman is most definitely my favorite fictional character of all time as well as my favorite superhero. the morals of this movie are also really great and very thought provoking. it really makes us question ourselves and society as we know it. the whole thing about batman being the dark knight as opposed to harveys white knight is incredible and serves as the basis of why i love batman so much. as a comic book fan i think that it was incredible faithful to the source material which is mainly the comic book the long halloween but it also has influences from the killing joke which is one of my favorite comic book stories. all in all i think the dark knight is an excellent film and deserved those oscars. 9.5 to 10 out of 10 for me.
