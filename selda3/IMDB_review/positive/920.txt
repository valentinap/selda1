ill admit when i first heard that marvel was doing a guardians of the galaxy movie the only thing i could think was really? in a rather disappointed tone as if marvel had lost their mind after iron man iron man 2 thor captain america the avengers yes iron man 3 thor the dark world and captain america winter soldier they green lighted a gotg movie? what were they thinking? then i saw the first trailer and it caught my interest but i still just couldnt picture it not along side the greatness of the previous marvel movies it just didnt seem like it would be a good movie to me i couldnt conceive of what possible plot they could have come up with for a move with a raccoon and a tree then i saw the fourth trailer on itunes and got rather excited from the fourth trailer i started to have hope but the big problem with having hope in a movie you know nothing about is that you can get that hope dashedquickly but i bought my ticket anyway giving marvel the benefit of the doubt after all perfect track record so far if anything it wasnt going to completely suck that much i knew first part of the movie before the marvel logo actually tugged at my heart then the part after the credits had me laughing so hard i instantly knew this was going to be a perfect movie and not a single moment of the movie disappointed me i laughed and i laughed and i was excited and i grew more excited and i laughed some more it was the best time ive had at the movies in years it has been forever since i left a theater that excited to see a movie again and i plan to see it many more times thank you marvel for giving me a new favorite movie
