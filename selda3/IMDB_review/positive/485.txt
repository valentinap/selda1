the dark knight rises is a masterpiece. its a movie i can watch over and over. it keeps you on the edge of your seat the whole time. heath ledgers role in this movie is excellent. he played the joker perfectly. the movie ends very well. its a lengthy movie but it doesnt seem very long because it keeps you interested. i believe this movie should be ranked higher in the top 250 honestly. at least number 2. this movie doesnt overload you on any one element. theres a perfect amount of action drama suspense and some comical aspects in there too. nolan did an excellent job on this movie and the whole trilogy actually. this isnt one of those movies where you can predict the ending or how things will play out this is the joker. the joker being in this one just throws you all over the place without making it confusing surprising would be a good word for it. there is so many plot twists. all in all. watch this movie if you havent already. its awesome
