this movie blew me away one word to some it all up is refreshing thats what this movie was to me finally something different original but intelligent the way the story is told the dialogue the cast  everything was right on the money the movie is filed with classic scenes memorable quotes and unforgettable characters i recommend this film to everyone who wants to see something fresh beware you must open minded fallow the story but dont worry even if its told in a special way it isnt avant-garde to the point where its impossible to understand it i just hope that tarantino can come up with the magic again i was disappointed with jackie brown i cannot blame him not every movie could be masterpiece
