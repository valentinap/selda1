this has got to be one of my favourite films of all time. i first saw it when it made it to british tv and have only just got round to buying it and ive watched it a few times since then. the characters have so much depth you end up loving them the more you watch this film. the acting is first class. the cinematography is first class. the sound is first class. the casting is first class. the dialogue is fantastic. all these elements and more make this a riveting watch and you end up wishing the film could be longer. this is one of the few times ive seen a film after reading the book thinking the film is an improvement. it seems to me it expands a little on stephen kings novella. this film deserves the rating it has here on imdb
