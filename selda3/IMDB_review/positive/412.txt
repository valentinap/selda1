the return of the king is a film full of ambition. that is what truly sets this film apart from so many similar fantasy adventures. the scope and scale of this film was enormous i do not think that there has ever been a film made with one quite as large as this one and im not sure there will ever be another. though not only is return of the king a true epic through and through it also has a ton of drama. this film has so much emotional resonance and it achieves this by simply playing off of these wonderful characters and who they truly are. when sam picks frodo up and carries him up the slope of mount doom one would almost feel their eyes begin to tear up. this film is not only a terrific actioner but it is also a beautiful film that might even force the more hardened moviegoers to shed a tear before all is said and done. when it is over there is no denying that the return of the king is one of the greatest achievements ever captured on film. i give the return of the king a perfect 10 out of 10
