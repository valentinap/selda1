my life is forever changed due to this movie. it is a movie of hope redemption and friendship. it shows a deep growing friendship between two prisoners andy and red. they each are shown growing through their distinct hardships at shawshank prison. as time passes hope wanes but a flame burns bright in andy. his hope and unrelentless nature carry over to his friend red. as reds long stay in prison comes to an end he sees the light at the end of the tunnel. andy has left it for him to see the way to freedom and he follows it. this film parallels my life and leaves me wondering if my advice will help somebody see the light. for some of those people time will tell. as for now ill be patient to wait and see. dont end up like brooks there will always be someone to help you out. there is someone out there that cares for you. thank you andy dufresne your hope is the flame of my life.
