this is for sure not the movie you can just leave behind in the theaters it is a must to have this in your movie collection. and like any true trilogy this movie is not the same if you have not seen the previous two installments. if you grew up and always loved batman and marvel movies and comics this one will not disappoint you. it is great to see all the characters come back and look and act even that much more fitting then you remembered them. christian bale played an extraordinary batman and i might say he could be one of the best actors to play batman. in my eyes this is an exceptional superhero movie it is masterful filmmaking by any standard.
