this film is really an amazing movie timeless. one of my all time favorites. about the long-can write something in a movie. masters said everything i needed there is not yet aware of the movie and i watched it for people to watch i would like to invite. than you. shawshank redemption is a very moving story about hope and the power of friendship. the cast is first rate with everyone giving a great performance. tim robbins and morgan freeman carry the movie but bob gunton and clancy brown are perfect as the warden norton and prison guard captain hadley respectively. and james whitmores portrayal of an elderly inmate brooks is moving. the screenplay gives almost every actor at least one or more memorable lines through out the film. as well as a very surprising twist near the end that almost knocked me out of my chair. if you have not seen this movie rent it or better yet buy it. as i bet youll want to see this one more than once.
