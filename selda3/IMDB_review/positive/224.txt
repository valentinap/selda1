this movie is certainly the best of the year  perhaps of the decadei think it probably impacted me more than othersbecause i have a similar age that the actor haveso it was kind of nostalgic in some situations i could see the changes that the actors were having in a subtle way and that was just very naturalits very interesting you see a 10 years old boy playing video games and in just some minutes the same boy looking for a job or looking for relationshipsit shows in a brilliant way how time its easily gonei dont really think it is possible to do a spoiler with this movie  but if its possible  perhaps the following paragraph may contain the end is fantasticin the very moment the movie is over  you thinkyou feel the moment present moment and you just know that life is built of little moments  and this movie was certainly one of mine
