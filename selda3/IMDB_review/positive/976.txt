i think the return of the king was the best ending. the acting was great and the special effects were spectacular. it was smart of peter jackson to do the trilogy during an era when motion picture technology involved computers. without computers it would have been difficult to make this trilogy. i enjoyed the superb acting of orlando bloom as legolas john rhys-davies as gimli ian mckellen for gandalf and viggo mortensen for aragorn. the four hobbits were performed by great actors. the battle in the pelennor fields and minas tirith was the best fight sequence i have ever seen in a motion picture. it defeats star wars and the matrix combined. the battle seen is the victor of the movies since its beginning. arwen had little importance but focusing on one hobbit named frodo is not good for attention grabbing. the alternation of scenes was the best way to keep the audience up. arwen was important to the last installment because it shows her love for aragorn. the ending could have been shorter but overall the film has little errors and more achievements.
