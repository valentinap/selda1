this is my 1st review on imdb  i dont like writing reviews for a movie after all its just a movie.....you see a movie and you forget... 95% of the movies you see and you forget soon well this movie really moves you and some of it remains with you ....gives you a great deal of idea how the real world is... each time you see it you feel light and get a feeling of satisfaction .... and more over if you like morgan free-man youll love of him after this one.... great movie... used to wonder why is it so highly rated.... well after seeing it.... i dont want to let the rating fall so i added mine and given it what it deserves...and i hope it remains at the top... i would like to thank the film maker and the production as a fan for a wonderful experience i got after seeing this movie :
