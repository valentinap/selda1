where do i even begin with the lord of the rings trilogy it is one of the finest film trilogies to ever make it to the big screen. peter jackson was admittedly an unexpected choice of director for the trilogy. before lord of the rings he made the frighteners bad taste meet the feebles and heavenly creatures. heavenly creatures was his first step out of absurd cinema and then after the frighteners came out in 1996 the lord of the rings: the fellowship of the ring was released in 2001 and became a critical commercial and prestigious success. the two towers had the same success in 2002 and finally the return of the king came and was the greatest of the lord of the rings trilogy and the first ever fantasy movie to win the academy award for best picture and went on to win the bafta for best film and the golden globe for best picture - drama. the return of the king won all these awards for the right reasons. it was epic gorgeous a story that has been told consistently great from start to finish and everything works. lord of the rings is one of those tales that will live on forever and ever. j.r.r. tolkien would be extremely proud even if his son christopher isnt proud of the movies. the lord of the rings: the return of the king will be remembered and still be considered one of the finest movies ever made. an achievement on an epic cinematic level and a cultural milestone.
