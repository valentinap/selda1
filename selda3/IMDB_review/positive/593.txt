quentin tarantino is the jerry lee lewis of cinema a pounding performer who doesnt care if he tears up the piano as long as everybody is rocking. his new movie pulp fiction is a comedy about blood guts violence strange sex drugs fixed fights dead body disposal leather freaks and a wristwatch that makes a dark journey down through the generations. seeing this movie last may at the cannes film festival i knew it was either one of the years best films or one of the worst. tarantino is too gifted a filmmaker to make a boring movie but he could possibly make a bad one: like edward d. wood jr. proclaimed the worst director of all time hes in love with every shot - intoxicated with the very act of making a movie. its that very lack of caution and introspection that makes pulp fiction crackle like an ozone generator: heres a director whos been let loose inside the toy store and wants to play all night.
