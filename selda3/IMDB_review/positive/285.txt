this is one of the most amazing movies ive ever watched. it is based on a steven king book which makes the plot not predictable. the story twists and turns while during the movie it seems that it is heading on a straight path forward. it tells the story of a banker which is accused of murdering his wife and her lover. he is sentenced to life in prison and placed in the shawshank prison where he meets a group of inmates which become his close friends during the decades he spends in prison. the movie tells the story of his life and struggles in the prison environment. any addition to the abstract will spoil the experience and perhaps be a spoiler. the amazing casting of both morgan freeman and tim robbins is amazing and couldnt be more accurate. i remember the first time i saw this movie many more viewing after that the movie just dont get old i was engulfed in it for the whole duration. a must-see movie for anyone and everyone.
