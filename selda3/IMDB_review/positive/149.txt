truly a strong addition to the marvel cinematic universe and faithful to its comics guardians of the galaxy does more than entertain the audience it takes the viewers to this level of awesomeness in a rather messy manner but its totally worth sitting through rocket and groot were my personal favorites i love the way the makers filled this movie with humor and style this is perhaps one of the strongest movies of 2014 along with marvels captain america the winter soldier perhaps slightly better depends on how you wanna look at it also id like to add that this movie is oscar worthy dont get me wronggroot is the best animated feature of the year so far and the visual effects were also pretty impressive only time will tell if this movie can maintain it i also love the fact that they are linked to the avengers via thanos if you havent watched it already go see it asap
