the movie was spectacular. the trilogy cannot be described in any word nor any string of words put together to form a phrase or anything else. it was unbelievably impressive. starting with the movie once again the acting was phenomenal. the emotion evoked and the empathy one feels for the characters is truly sincere. its amazing at how a movie can be four hours long yet not feel as if it was more than three or two and a half. the visual effects are incredible. the trilogy as a whole is unbelievable
