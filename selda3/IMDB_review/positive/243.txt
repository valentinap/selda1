this movie doesnt deserve a 10 it deserves a 11... this is the best movie i ever saw everything on the movie is great the story the acting the message just everything. i spoke with so many people that saw this movie and everyone of them said that the shawshak redemption is a truly masterpiece. if someone is reading this- please stop reading and go and watch the movies if you havent yet because you will see one of the best movies ever made in human history. it is the best rated movie 9.2 and when i see that rating im just asking myself why is there just a 9.2 instead of a 10
