the casting is top notch cinematography makes for a gritty realistic crime world. make-up and art direction could not be better. this movie feels really close to brandon lees the crow. i am surprised it did not receive an r- rating due to its dark content and wicked performance by one of the greats in heath ledgers joker. the pacing is excellent as well and the  establishes great character identification. suspenseful and wicked fun watch it with the lights out with a bucket of popcorn kick back and be blown out of your seat and here we...go
