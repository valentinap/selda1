there will never be another superhero film that can beat the dark knights its unbelievably good. it continues on from batman begins showing a more experienced batman in a darker gotham city. the dark knight shows batman pushed to his limits leaving the audience questioning whether he will give in. everything you could want from a realistic batman film is there and i cant think of many ways that this masterpiece could be improved. every scene is amazing and heath ledgers acting is better than any ive ever seen before making it impossible to look away from the screen. it is not necessary to watch batman begins prior to the dark knight however to fully understand the story id recommend it as batman begins is an outstanding example of an origin story so you might as well see the full trilogy.
