what can i add to all the other reviews here just my own feelings about this. i now realise i watched the film in one of the hardest times emotionally i can remember in my life. thoughts chasing themselves around in my head heartbroken paranoid and not well physically. total mess. my dear female friend who got me through it all told me this was a film to watch. i initially resisted thinking it was going to be lightweight pc fare. i dont know why i thought that. theres a lacklustre opening sequence -i think. then you get to see what kind of performance morgan freeman is going to turn out this time and you start to be interested. then this extraordinary scene flying over the prison and i think by then youre hooked. this scene is deeply moving not least because of the music. its difficult to see how thomas newmans music for this film could possibly be bettered - perfectly listenable to in its own right but when you do youre reminded of the boys on the roof in the sun enjoying their first beer for so long. theyve been touched by andys kindness. sometimes a kindness is thrown back in ones face but other times a gesture of gratitude is given back - like haywood getting up and offering andy one of his beers - and a powerful connection is made. the film is full of great hardships and unbearable sadness - surely scars that can never completely heal or be forgotten. but it is also full of joy and fun and hope. to capture all the above in a film is a triumph. i started watching the film fairly closed to feeling but as i watched the end i could not contain my tears unusually. so a moment when a film came along at the right time for me and no doubt for many others
