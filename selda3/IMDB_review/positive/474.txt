the entire lord of the rings saga deserves to be immortalized as such an epic incarnation of great fantasy. this whole trilogy was the reason why i became interested in the fantasy genre as a young adult. i remember seeing the two towers and the return of the king when they were respectively being released in theaters. both of the movies blew me away. they were unlike anything i had ever seen in my life. this was a driving force to me because now i wanted to read not only the lord of the rings and other tolkien books but also the r. a. salvatore and dark sun world books. this was such an influential movie to me and i hope that it is movies like this that are passed on to the next generation. good acting epic battle scenes convincing dialogue well-done settings and an awesome story all comprise the entire lotr trilogy. i say this as a die-hard fan of the fantasy genre first baptized by lord of the rings
