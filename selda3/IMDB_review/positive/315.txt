this is a masterpiece that words cant describe.in my opinion and many others this is the best movie if not ever at least of the 21st century no doubt. heath ledger was so so so awesomewho could ever thought that he could be the joker and not only be but playing it in the best way possible.c.bale is my favorite batman of all time and aaron eckhart was pretty good too. here has a 9.0 rating which in my opinion is not enough it should have had at least 9.5 but hey after all it has 1.2 million voters and 47.5% gave it a 10. this movie is epic is just so good i will never understand those who hate on this movie but this movie is so good and the best one out there.if you havent seen the movie go see it now you have no idea what youre missing even though i dont think there are many humans that havent watch this movie. i would say i give it a 10 but it seems so little for this movie so i give it 11/10.
