this second film in the dark knight trilogy shows us the real side of christopher nolans the dark knight. from all of the batman movies and series ever made this is the one who stands out to be best. there is no way of mentioning this film without talking about heath ledgers performance as the joker he is showing us the dark and magnificent side of the joker heath ledger gives possibly his best performance of his life in this movie we have seen jack nicholsen as one joker before but ledger came up with this incredible interpretation of the character not the soft side but the evil explicate character we see in the comics. the tics the mind-blowing plans from the guy who doesnt come up with plans. christian bale is clearly the best batman of my choice he does the dark batman to his own and makes him his dark knight the cooperation bale nolan and ledger have had through this film is incredible making it one of the best films made of my opinion  for a truly excellent game all the elements must come together. everyone involved must have perfect form. director darabont must have been at the top of his game when he put this gem together. of course the actors were excellent  morgan freeman and tim robbins seldom disappoint. the thing that makes this movie exceptional is that darabont coaxed the best performances out of the supporting actors also. bob gunton and clancy brown were utterly believable and bad guys dont come much worse than them. the other essential ingredient for a successful movie is simple: it must have a well thought out plot with a perfect beginning middle and end. so many movies fall over by getting at least one of these aspects wrong. not so with shawshank redemption. just like goldilocks said this is just right buy this one for your home collection because youll definitely want to see it again.
