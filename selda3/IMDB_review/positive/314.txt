this is a movie for anyone who loves science fiction the film had a long playtime but after ive seen the movie i understood why its a galactic experience with such detail and sense of a space simulator did you find movie gravity was cool so is this movie light years better it has a style similar to 2001 a space odyssey but everything in this movie has so much more to effort this isnt an adventure its more like an explosion of details and experiences through a drama perspective it has it all for the fanatical science fiction nerd to thrive and the movie does that to the maximum an excellent movie
