ive already mentioned that david fincher is one of my favorite directors and i think that next to christopher nolan are both of my favorites of the moment when i learned that gone girl would be the new finchers movie without reading the eponymous novel by gillian flynn i hitch with want to see you because he called me much attention to the kind of story that was because it is not just a suspected murder and i think its a movie that although many will say is to see it once because the surprise no longer exist in a second chance i personally did not see it couldnt praise fincher is one of the most known to the hour of handle stories with murders and this is no exception go way to adapt the great novel of flynn perhaps even so is still the movie without that fincher or is in the hands of another director would suffer less than any other of its repertoire even so it seems to me the task of effective fincher with the staging and on with the address in general perhaps it is not looks with the camera as it has done for zodiac 2007 perhaps not his best film but the best directed by him although raises too much the first material of which it has at its disposal in that area has not gone girl dodging decadence notorious or much less ben affleck and rosamund pike is look as ever especially the first because in my opinion never before vi as sober and speaking of pike an oscar nomination does not surprise me at all in conclusion with this the best performance for both since fincher worked with two actors who in their past does not have to wide acclaim beyond the indent shared of ben affleck and matt damon in good will hunting 1997 which led them to be crowned as the statuette for best original screenplay oscar however lucidity for both and i think more of pikes side that at times she steals the movie with her interpretation together with its director it seems that things are made easier too besides fincher makes affleck seems like a good actor with his interpretation of nick dunne but nor is it to diminish the afflecks interpretation because it is clear that this time he made it gone girl develops in any moment things with calm and does not reach to sacrificing too much that is why the surprises are functional and integrated into the story in an extraordinary way work on the creation of atmosphere is another of the strengths of the film as is worth by moments of a purely environmental music accurate and full of mystery really what works wonderfully and helps a lot with the burden of suspense that we all want to see perhaps many leave surprised after the outcome because it is not for less however many criticize its particular end which in my opinion it is just perfect in fact there is a great honor to everything that has been the whole movie i am not sure to say that gone girl is the best of fincher because i have in the head seven 1995 andor the fight club 1999 but what if i am sure of is that so far is the best of the year and could not be otherwise with fincher
