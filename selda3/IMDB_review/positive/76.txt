when i first saw this movie i was pretty confused and i had to see it a couple more times before i understood it all many critics hated mission impossible because of this i liked that it was very complicated it added to the mystery i think the part in the cia terminal room is classic very exciting this is one of brian de palmas best he throws lots of surprises at you tom cruise and ving rhames are always good together and i liked emilio estevezs part *** 12 stars
