this is a very very very great film. its my all time favorite. first of all the acting is f**king great. my favorite actor in the entire film is easily morgan freeman. he should have won that oscar the fact that he didnt is a f**king disgrace. now the music to this movie is not to memorable but is still great and sets the mood for the film. now the story line is brilliant. andy dufresne is accused of the murder of the wife and her secret lover so he is sentenced to shawshank state prison. there he develops a friendship with a prisoner named red. the sets in this movie are great. as expected. so in the end this is a great movie and you should really check it out.
