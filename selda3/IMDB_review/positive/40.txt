why shawshank redemption isnt rated 9.9/10 is beyond me. what has caused me to reflect and comment on this film is the small things...99.9% of movies miss them. a movie is a photographic montage of images with sound and is meant to represent a story. humans have always enjoyed stories from time immemorial huddled around fires in caves to modern things like facebook or youtube its all about stories. shawshank has many small instances that frank darabont included like when red leaves a small note to andy with a free poster when he returns from the hospital/isolation. another small instance is when andy gives red the harmonica it could easily not have been filmed but it touches everyone with its deeper meanings. its a collage of many small instances that make it meaningful and memorable over and over again. i am convinced thats why everyone loves this movie and watch it repeatedly its the small things that touch you. how many movies have given you the most important small message of all...of hope...its the most powerful of goals we can have hope really sets you free.
