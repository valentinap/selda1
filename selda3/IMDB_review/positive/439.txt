the lord of the rings: return of the king is the third and final installment of peter jacksons adaptations of tolkiens famous fantasy novels. once again the makers of the film have taken care with the costumes sets scenery models cgi effects and howard shores epic  to create a convincing depiction of middle earth. once again the cast delivers expert performances. john noble joins the cast as denethor and effectively makes him into a despicable and repugnant character. three of the performances in the film were particularly memorable for me. bernard hill once again brings authority to the role of king theoden and his inspiring presence on the battlefield left me in awe. miranda otto brings strength to the role of eowyn and makes the characters best moments unforgettable. ian mckellen once again brought his commanding presence as gandalf to bear as he tried desperately to hold everything together. this film follows the familiar format of the first two films in taking tolkiens work and streamlining it to create a well-paced film. the famous battle at minas tirith is on an unprecedented scale and the best fantasy battle ever filmed. as with the first two films i found the added scenes for the extended addition interesting but they didnt add much above and beyond the already great theatre cut.
