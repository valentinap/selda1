this will be a short review not because i do not have time but because of the magnificence it brought to me is in my mind forever more. i remembered seeing this in the cinema of my hometown in sweden it was the best of my life. i had goosebumps throughout the whole movie. a must see for those who have not. even now i feel like a kid again watching it. my childhood of sword-plays with sticks in the forestspretending to be fighting an army of orcs is a truth while watching this with surround sound. the costumes the characters i salute tolkien for this glorious work and salutes jackson for the splendid adventure he has captures on the cinema screen
