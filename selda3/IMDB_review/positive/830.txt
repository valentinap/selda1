it was a great movie. i would love to play a part in it i am a huge fan of all of the lord of the rings. i love how each one leaves you wanting more. you cant stop at just one. you must keep going... its infectious its got plenty of mysterylovefriendshipbattlesmagic its really just a great set. good verses evil as most movies have but so much morei am a die hard fan of lord of the rings all of them and that is including the new hobbit is awesome i can not wait to see the next one i will be at the theater as soon as it comes out everything i imagined as a small girl comes to life in these movies. its such a beautiful fantasyadventure movie for every child and adult who has an imagination.
