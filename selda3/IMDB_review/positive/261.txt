this is the second best scifi movie i have watched the first one i absolutely fell in love was the avatar oh i do love those movies the guardians of the galaxy has everything action drama humor it is simply worth watching the storyline is very interesting it is indeed great to watch the creation of someone who has put it on the screen i admire the way the actors play simply amazing i honestly was surprised that vin diesel was the voice of groot and actually after behind the scenes videos i discovered that lee pace is actually ronan amazing how sometimes you cannot even recognize some wonderful personalities really those who havent managed to see it  you must watch enjoy the movie
