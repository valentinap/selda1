whenever i see a prison or even think about it the first thing that comes to my mind is this film. maybe its because i have watched this masterpiece so many times that its actually made a place inside my head and will never go away. i just cannot explain how well this film is made. the direction and screenplay by frank darabont and the fact that it is based upon rita hayworth and shawshank redemption by stephen king makes it highly likable. moving on to the performances by tim robbins as andy dufresne and morgan freeman as ellis boyd red redding they shine just like a diamond stupendous performances by them. i still cant believe that it never got any major accolade and didnt even make much money but still it has developed into something sensational which cant be missed.
