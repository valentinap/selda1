i think the big question...or the question everyone actually cares about is this: is christopher nolans follow up to the critically acclaimed 2005 film batman begins the dark knight as good as everyone is saying quite simply yes yes it is. there is no doubt about it one of the most anticipated movies of the 21st century duly deserves every amount of praise lavished onto it. this is no ordinary superhero movie this is a character and dialogue driven piece not as action orientated as you might expect. i will not go into plot details because there is a lot of it. however a basic one sentence summary is: batman now has to face his most cunning and psychotic enemy someone with no real motives...the joker. now that that is out of the way i will start off with the actors and boy is there a lot to talk about. christian bale has done a tremendous job as our beloved caped crusader with him already blowing everyone else out of water with batman begins. bruce wayne has a flawed personality that hangs on the balance between righteousness and criminal. his perception of justice causes an emotional and personal shift whether he is a wealthy businessman who fights crime in a gadget-riddled suit or just a normal man who is sick of all the scum in gotham city and decides to give the law-breakers a dose of their own medicine. because of this and bales tremendous acting bruce wayne is justified and we emphasise with bales flawed hero more than any of the other actors. if there ever was an excellent batman this is it. the theme of right and wrong is played well with his character here. of course i am sure you all want know if heath ledger was that good. and i can safely say that he most definitely was. ledgers joker is not only the best but is now the greatest superhero film villain ever. his performance is truly terrifying chilling brilliant
