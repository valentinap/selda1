well directed well produced love the photography and the script is amazing quentin tarantino is one of my preferred directors and the pulp fiction was the first film from tarantino that made me start looking different for this directors work the arc of this script is super well created once the story connects all the scenes and characters in an order which makes you get into the movie the photography of this movie is also amazing very well planned in a way which brings all the atmosphere of the entire movie the characters are amazing super well acted by this super list of cast about tarantinos direction there nothing that i can tell  in my opinion this guy is a genius with enough sensibility to put the audience on the right climax at the right moment one of the best movies i have ever seen
