ill admit that this jolly vanilla stuff isnt my cup of tea and everyone practically has read the script already but holy fairy godmother cinderella is fantastic acting and visual are stellar they reach the magical effect intended and also a touch of humility it literally dazzles with sheer production value until you cant help but feeling that warm fuzzy sensation of disney magic cinderella lily james is a poor orphan who is enslaved by her evil stepmother cate blanchett we all know this already the movie has a task to just retell the story consistently thankfully the great line of actors does that admirably well there will be a certain expectation on how the characters behave for the main pair lily james and her prince richard madden look fitting she has innocent ambiance albeit slightly passive on her trial its a less empowering female especially after frozen and maleficent ronda rousey wouldnt have this problem however it stays true to its root and if you want someone to look likable and good in blue dress lily james fits the bill richard madden delivers a light persona as its his duty to be charming he does it so well i didnt realize hes the same guy from a more harrowing ball of game of thrones the best has to be cate blanchett as the stepmother shes cunningly annoying shes a mix between complaining soccer mom and supervillain basically the most pg portrayal of antagonist to invoke loathing from audience but not till the point of giving them nightmare helena botham carter as fairy godmother is a rather predictable cast i didnt follow the movies hype but when the character appeared i thought that helena carter would be appropriate then there she was magic script is fancy and suave but its also not over reaching the dialogues are engaging as they are delivered with confident they sound very poise and high class without being too cheesy production value and costume are downright mythical it seems that cinderella wants gold statues for the wedding and seeing how majestic everyone and everything look it may just grasp the rewards for next year cinderellas biggest magic is its universal charm a children fairy tale that is uplifting and enjoyable for all ages thats what matters most
