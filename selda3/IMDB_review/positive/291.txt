this is one of my favorite movies.i love the acting and characters.i think it is intense and suspenseful.i think it has one of the best versions of the joker.i like how it deals with the corruption of the police force.my favorite part is when batman interrogated joker.i think it was unique that batman could not save rachelsince usually the hero saves someone that has been kidnapped.i liked harvey going bad because it shows that even really good people can turn.i dont blame it on the joker though because harvey was a little bad when he interrogated the guy in the chair.people in internal affairs also called him harvey two-face implying he had a darker side. i would recommend this movie to any batman or drama fan.
