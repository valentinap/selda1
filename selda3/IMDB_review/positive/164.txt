this was probably my favorite trilogy of all time as throughout movie history there have not been all that many good fantasy movies that have been released so these films fill that void for me. this last chapter wraps up the story nicely as frodo and sam are very close to where they need to be and the army of sauron are trying to finish off man once and for all. this movie is a bit different than the last one in the fact that the hobbits frodo and sam and gandolf the wizard are more of the focus of this one rather than aragon gimli and legolos who were more the focus of the last one. this one has epic battles and great visuals as well. it is also very well acted. sean astin does a particularly good job as sam in this one as his character has a lot more impact in this one. all in all a very good movie that wrapped up a very good trilogy that was one of the few that did not have a weak movie in the bunch. i would write more but i am sure there are plenty of reviews that do the movie more justice than i can.
