okay this title is the key for tarantino in the movies. the storyline is perfect the conclusion may be sad but in fact its the life indeed. the action in the movie have strong scenes showing the life of a bounty hunter in the new ages. the movies can be difficult to people who do not like a detailed story showing the every details of all action/dialogs etc. if youre not a fan of the cult films may be this title is not for you. but if you are a big fan of the cult films just like me well this movie was made _ÑÊ_ÑÊfor you to watch this you must know some rules the end is the begging and vice versa. and what do i mean well in the tarantinos style of making films he dont start with the begin of the plot
