insurgent picks up shortly after the events in divergent with obvious intentions to maintain if not speed up the momentum of the franchise theres no doubt how fascinating the divergent universe is and while it shares almost the same elements that made many of the ya franchises today successful the movie has its own unique facets to separate itself apart unfortunately in insurgent those elements arent effectively explored and utilized once again movie makers fall prey to this mentality or should i say practice that seems to highlight the films visual panache but dismisses the utmost importance of effective storytelling i think ive gone redundant here but to be honest insurgent is no different and if youd allow me to make this honesty even brutal this divergent sequel tracks a deteriorating trajectory and you can imagine how the franchise is set to get even worse knowing the last book of the trilogy is going to be split into two movies this doesnt surprise me at all given the fact how film makers has been consistently regarding these popular franchises as merely cash cows in insurgent the plot thickens and not just that it branches out to several sub ones thats when the film begins losing its grip around the central story giving way to subplots that dont make sense at all if not barely as she searches for allies crossing one factions territony to anothers our titular heroine tris finds herself in a catandmouse chase with the enemy in this case jeanine kate winslet a name that veronically roth seems to suggest to be perfect for a character she molds as a supervillainess that embodies terror am i being sarcastic? of course iam lol and her loyal erudite followers tris maintains reluctance but when jeanine turns toward her loved ones our heroine succumbs and surrenders herself to the enemy this is so new insurgent draws in more actors on its payroll to play new characters but barely utilizes them up to their full capacity in the end its shailene woodley that mostly does her job as the central character on the films key moments she undoubtedly shines only her efforts arent enough to place the movies charm to the same level as hers no thanks to the chemistry the film seems to suggest four and tris have because i dont think i felt it it was missing the action sequences are well played i must say and the visual effects borders extravagance but against a weak and unfocused narrative insurgent is a film you better just wait to come out on dvd instead and not one to waste time and money on not unless youre planning to critique it the same i do
