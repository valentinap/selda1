the movie is about the fall of two heroes - gothams unofficial hero and gothams real hero. im talking about the dark knight and harvey dent. this amazing movie shows how easy its to fall to the dark side what harvey dent did. aaron eckhart is great in this role and heath ledger really shows what acting is.i really love heath ledger for his portrayal of the joker his best role. but unfortunately he past away and he got a oscar post-morten. the question if he really deserved the academy award is hard to answer he had a lot of really amazing competitors. im afraid to say too much in this review so my best tip is to buy it on blu-ray or dvd and watch it i promise you youll love it.
