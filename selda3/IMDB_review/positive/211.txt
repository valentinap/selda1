this movie is one of the best i have ever seen. i first read the book and i didnt liked it that much but then i saw the movie. and thats a things thats never happened to me before the movie was better than the book. its the other way normally. but in this case the movie is so much better i like the end more than in the book. watch the movie it is great.  but if you pay attention you shall see what he mean. in fact all the hole charm of tarantino is his way of make a good plot showing little details and thats make this unique at all. you can know all the hole life of the character just listening well the dialogs in the movie...and this is fantastic in a strange way. well my last word is: watch
