the muchanticipated interstellar arrived and immediately created massive explosions both on film and in the films response many like myself found it to be an unprecedented masterpiece others have called the film too outlandish or ridiculous due to its fictitious scientific perspectives this of course also happened with last years space thriller gravity and please take note interstellar is not gravity it is undeniable that both are true spectacles to watch but interstellar is a much more philosophical and emotional film it is a surreal journey out of our galaxy and feels vividly alive all while making you contemplate the realities of humanity and the spectrum of emotions we experience such as love and how its manner of existence cannot be measured in scientific terms that being said interstellar is a very scientific film yet it is one that brilliantly manages to balance out with emotional character development and astounding space cinematography it can feel stark or it can feel mindbending and its transitions are superbly executed spectacular cinematography and original storytelling come as no surprise when watching a film directed by christopher nolan best known for inception and the dark knight trilogy his entire filmography is astounding and highly recommended by me of course so those hyped for the film due to his involvement flocked to the theater along with matthew mcconaugheys huge fanbase since what has been labeled the mcconaissance a ridiculous term yes but lets be thankful hes gone from bad romcoms to the dramatic roles hes thrived in from mud to dallas buyers club the fact of the matter is as a piece of cinema interstellar stands out it has many odes to 2001 a space odyssey and even star wars due to nolans love for scifi however much unlike these films interstellar remains grounded outside of alien life whether interstellar dabbles into the supernatural is cause for debate due to the films scientific presentation mixed with fiction this is precisely why interstellar is an unprecedented experience it presents real scientific facts and asks tough philosophical questions yet remains a grippingly lucid scifi film discussing interstellar feels much like presenting someone with a gift and not wanting to give any hints as to what it is the films layers are cleverly peeled off and its progression is so beautifully carried out that there is truly nothing like experiencing it and absorbing its concepts and theories after it is over i suppose ive delayed discussing interstellars plot because it is a film in which every plot point is important and imaginative and giving anything away would feel like giving away a meaningful piece i will nevertheless present you with an introduction and very minor synopsis of the film interstellar follows cooper played by mcconaughey living with his fatherinlaw son and daughter in a desolate earth filled with extreme dust storms homes and human lungs are filled with dust as people struggle to survive with limited resources in a deteriorating and depleting earth cooper is a farmer who once flew for nasa before the earths descent and his crops  along with crops around the entire globe are dying due to the earths excessive drought and dust plagues upon making entirely unexpected discoveries cooper is faced with making the difficult decision of leaving his family for the exploration of planets sustainable of human life in a galaxy outside of our own with the spectacular anne hathaway at his side not to mention a sarcastic clunky robot interstellar becomes a humorous experience as much as it is intellectually stimulating and incredibly moving this is a film that simply cannot be missed due to its intricacy beauty and manner of evoking a response from all those who experience it for more of my film rants follow me on twitter calciumwaste
