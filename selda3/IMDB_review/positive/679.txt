one of the best and must watch movie which i ever enjoyed....shawshank encompasses friendships hardships hopes and dreams. and what is so great about the movie is that it moves you it gives you hope. even though the circumstances between the characters and the viewers are quite different you dont feel that far removed from what the characters are going through. it is a simple film yet it has an everlasting message. frank darabont didnt need to put any kind of outlandish special effects to get us to love this film the narration and the acting does that for him. why this movie didnt win all seven oscars is beyond me but dont let that sway you to not see this film let its ranking on the imdbs top 250 list sway you let your friends recommendation about the movie sway you. set aside a little over two hours tonight and rent this movie. you will finally understand what everyone is talking about and you will understand why this is my all time favorite movie.
