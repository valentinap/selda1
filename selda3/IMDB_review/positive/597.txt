quentin tarantino at his best this movie is mostly dialogs but it is so well written that you never get bored and it has the best product placement ever royal cheese :p this movie is great and still to this day one of my all time favorite movies amazing acting dialogues and screenplay each character has their own story and they are all likable characters and stories arent superifical they are in dept and likable it may not have a great message or anything but it is a great movie nonetheless also it is great to see bruce willis trying to act in a great non action movie they should do a lot more movies together
