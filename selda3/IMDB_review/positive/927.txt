if you havent seen this yet - get off of the moon and get to the cinema this has to be one of the best films of all time. minas tirith. nuff said 10/10  everybody did an excellent job with their individual flair of black comedy. the style was very familiar if you have seen quentins earlier work. i found this movie to be completely awesome something missing from movies nowadays. movies nowadays include a message but do not execute it the right way. pulp fiction though has no message and executes it nicely. its fun its gritty and its just over-the-top greatness. this is what i wanna expect from movies but sadly nothing can have that feeling you get when you finish pulp fiction. these facts combine to the fact that pulp fiction is one of my favorite films. it has no point  but the fact that is has no point puts it up there with the greatest. i had no expectations beforehand but afterword i had so much to praise. the entertainment the humor and the point. lying before yes it has a point. but it is too obscured to find out the real meaning. i love this movie and im sure you will too. dont walk in with expectations  itll ruin the surprise. the surprise is the joy and fun youll get with the film. pulp fiction includes great acting great fun and overall great entertainment. this is by far quentins best film... 10/10.
