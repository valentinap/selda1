quite possibly one of the best films ever made in terms of writing acting and pop culture reference. the dialogue is brilliant and intelligent. i definately dug it the most bruce willis and christopher walkens segment was hilarious in spite of the fact of delicate subject matter. i also enjoyed the that is a tasty burger segment.
