this is one of the greatest films i have ever seen. it has everything the battle scenes are wonderful especially and since the first hour is drama the action really gets to you and you feel like youre really there that is terrified. you care about the characters more than anything in this film so its scary watching a battle scene for the first time because its extremely unpredictable and you dont want your characters to die a few of them do. however the battle scenes are also very well done with a great mix of live-action and cgi. although this is a pg-13 film jackson really went over the limit with his battles  he totally rocked in the previous films. telling us to wait for the extended version isnt right. maybe jackson should have foregone one of the too many endings in rotk to give lee some film time. that said all the elements that worked in the previous movies were absolutely glorious in this film. the one new thing that i would add to so much that has already been written is that big kudos must go to the great tolkien artists alan lee and john howe whose artistry shaped so much of the imagery from the first moments of fotr to the final scenes of rotk. this historic trilogy would not have been the same without them. the lotr enterprise has clearly been a great labor of love from all who worked on it over the years and this final installment was a crowning achievement.
