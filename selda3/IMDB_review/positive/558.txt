shawshank redemption is probably one of the greatest movies out there hands down. its a story about a banker named andy dufresne who is sentenced to life in prison for killing his wife and her secret lover.at first for andy it seems that life has taken a toll for the worst while he goes through the first initial weeks in shawshank.fortunately he befriends a group of the inmates over the course of his time there. mainly a character named red who has some push on things that go down in the prison. red and andy learn a lot of lessons from each other and become really great friends over their course of time at shawshank. the dialogue in this movie is not only enticing but also has a bit of comic relief here and there. to me this movie mainly revolves not only the character development of andy as a man sent to jail for life but mainly about the human condition and what it is like to no longer be a free man. andys most important lesson that he learns in shawshank is that while they can take virtually everything away from you including your pride and your dignity they can never take your hope.
