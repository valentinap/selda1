ive never really been a major fan of superhero films they all seem too similar and they generally get boring after a while but batman: dark knight stunned me. fantastic acting- particularly from heath ledger r.i.p. and christian bale- made the film thrilling and suspenseful. the storyline setting and props where spot on and really made gotham city seem as realistic as possible. the film was also quote galore with the joker adding an utterly menacing atmosphere to the film. in terms of character development harvey dent was portrayed brilliantly originally being an authoritative policing figure who ultimately ended up as two-face a wreckless broken-hearted villain. the ending was also thrilling leaving it open and adding an air of mystery as to what was going to happen next with the final showdown also hinting at another batman film. however batman: dark knight rises was a great film but batman: dark knight is the better of the two. a must see film
