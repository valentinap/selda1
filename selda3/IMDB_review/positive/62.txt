when it comes to quentin tarantino op delivers and this movie is by far one of the best four in one stories or tales of violence and redemption out there true that the actors are pure talent but in connection with a mind-blowing storyline the result is easy grandiose words cannot dare to describe what feelings you may have while watching crime drama thriller and a little mystery in a tarantino movie can overcome decades of action movies the point is that im not trying to praise the director in any way i just think that its a must to express warm approval or admiration of him genius minds are a rare occasion to come in contact with gg tarantino
