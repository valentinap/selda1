samuel jackson john travolta  bruce willis - can this get any better  the dialogues are exquisite you will love the ezekiel 25:17 and will learn and say it every time u watch it  i can go on and on writing a review but all i really wanna say is please watch if youve watched it already then watch it again at any point of time if you find it confusing dont worry that would have happened to everyone  towards the end everything will be uncovered and there will be no questions unanswered left i can guarantee that anyone after watching this movie will not be disappointed and will become a quentin tarantino fan for life personally loved the soundtracks cheers
