this is one of the best movies about friendship ive ever seen also one of the best prison movies. i found it better than robert redfords castle. morgan freeman was perfect as usual and i can say that tim robbins reached the top of his performance and also his career. i wish this couple come together for another movie the kind of it is not important im sure the spectators will have the same taste as before. i watched most of the films of morgan freeman and i can say this was the best of his normally he prefers to play in films like sevenkiss the girlsalong came a spider... but i think he should think again that which kind of his films stay at the top of the charts...  all the other glitches are just that. if only you had given us tolkiens rendition here.
