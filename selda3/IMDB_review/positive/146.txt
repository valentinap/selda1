un predictable amazing film that is the only word to express this whole movie it is almost impossible to predict every scene that is shown for example when trabolta not sure with his names spelling carries uma who was dying and goes to the guy who sold the drug multitude of people would think that uma would die and trabolta falls in peril with the boss but guess what they success saving uma and did uma told the boss whole this nope she kept her mouth shut did this scene affect the story not at all everything is solved and actually this scene is not the final scene of the movie it was just the part of beginning but the most fascinating part is that in this movie the big story are pretty predictable but the little small storys elements are totally unpredictable how is this possible cause it is tarantinos film no respect for girls violence no respect for views visual he just make it the way he want to and that is the power that most of the directors cant have thats the power of the bravery you better watch this awesome film as fast as possible
