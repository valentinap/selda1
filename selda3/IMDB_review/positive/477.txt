the dark knight was the best of the christopher nolan trilogy heath ledgers joker is the best his raw talent and natural feel for the character will never be repeated the talent over all in the series was out of this world..michael cainmorgan freeman christian bale & gary oldman to name a few the passion of this trilogy really comes out in the dark knight why so serious & do you want to know how i got these scars have become house hold quotes my love for batman became stronger cause of these 3 movies everyone should see them rent them buy them but watch them they are that great i recommend a marathon of all the movies
