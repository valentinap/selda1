my story is one of fate. i went to the video store expecting to get terminator ii on laserdisc. it was out and out of desperation to rent something i asked for what was new. i was given the shawshank redemption. i had never heard of it quite honestly but i gave it a try but was not expecting much but two hours of time pass. the first time through watching it i thought it was good. nothing extraordinary. but something made me watch it again. and i was hooked. i cant explain it but this movie gets better every time you watch it. i ended up watching it about 8 times in that 4 day timespan. watch this movie as your bucket list of things to do in life. you really have not lived till you have seen it. i admit to being completely obsessed by the movie owning it on every medium imaginable and having all the books and posters about it. but do not let my obsession dissuade you. i do not impress easily but i can tell you this is simply the greatest movie ever made in cinema. every moment and every dialog of this movie fits in perfectly to create the greatest masterpiece in american cinema.
