i saw this film in 2008 for the first time and have since watched it over 30 times as i just cant get enough of the lotrs trilogy. i loved the film so much and the lotrs is now my all time favourite film series. it lives up to its previous two films and leaves you wishing for another film. i totally recommend watching the lotrs trilogy as all three of the films are absolutely phenomenal. the return of the king is a great film that rounds of the trilogy nicely it has the quest to take the ring to mount doom and many battle scenes with orcs surrounding minas tirith. the fellowship carry out the rest of the journey separately as they do not stay together until the end.
