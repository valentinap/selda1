when i first saw pulp fiction i thought it was a kinda cool movie  violent but in a cool way shocking but in a cool way i dont know how many times i have seen this film but i now see its so much more its a rich intertextual film going experience its a gangstar movie for lack of a stronger term its a black comedy its a renegade boxer story its easy rider deliverance and shaft its a film noir its a melodrama its romance and action its narrative flow is not just novel but near genious if tarantino was only allowed to be credited with one film in his amazing career this would definitely be the one
