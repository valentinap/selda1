interstellar  my experience love is the only thing that transcends time and space i am not sure whether i am intelligent enough to review this film but as a normal viewer i am going to share my views about the interstellar experience my interstellar experience started even before watching the film itself i spent some time brushing up my knowledge about the theories discussed in the film the advantage of being a physics student made my work easy in fact the movie became much more understandable in the near future our earth becomes more polluted and human beings have to find a new home to survive or at least to stop their species from extinction nasa sends a group of explorers into a newly discovered wormhole to find a habitable land for the humans this is just the basic plot of a wonderful experience this is a christopher nolan film and he wants the viewer to have some basic knowledge of physics to understand the film he is best known for the novelty in themes and the emotional approach he takes the dark knight trilogy director maintains his trademark of elevating the content than the characters nolan literally takes us to the outer space from earth to various planets through the wormhole one would really feel oneself as cooper while watching the film placing some unexpected events in between the writer amazes the viewer especially the climax the final phases of interstellar were mindblowing and thought provoking i was blown away by the ideals nolan placed in the penultimate scenes the concept of fifth dimensional sequences inside the tesseract came out as a surprise those sequences were beyond my imagination one of the best climaxes ever while watching the climax only one thought appeared in my mind how can this nolan be so brilliant and imaginative— special kudos to the nolan brothers for those excellent and heart touching dialogues even in the simpler scenes certain dialogues came out as wonder nolan wanted to express something which any space exploration film didnt express the eternity of love the emotional approach nolan takes to describe the fatherdaughter relationship between cooper and murph was heart touching he even draws a sketch over the life of space explorers how they spend years of their life selflessly searching for something that will be beneficial for the people on the earth keeping their lives at risk the unnoticed friendship between cooper & tars and the light humor they produce proves nolans mastery in presenting complex subjects in a simpler way christopher nolans films which are known for their utmost brilliancy in making also have memorable characters and interstellar is no exception oscar winning matthew mcconaughey perfected as cooper cooper will always remain as one of the most remarkable characters of all time he excelled in the emotional scenes i felt like crying when cooper watches the recorded videos sent to him from the earth such perfection anne hathaway and miachel caine too delivered memorable performances as amelia brand and professor brand anne was good in the emotional scenes especially in the scene she reveals her love for edmund miachel caine had an important role this time a lengthy one indeed the kid murph came out as a surprise mackenzie foy had all the emotions required for the character jessica chastain too delivered good performance as the adult murph casey affleck s negative shaded tom and matt damons extended cameo appearance as drmann were also interesting the two robotic characters tars and case too had equal importance in the story line tars will surely be remembered as one of the best robotic characters of all time music by hans zimmer and camera works by hoyte van hoytema makes nolans simple approach to the complex theme successful zimmer offered s matching the mood of the film in fact certain scenes were too silent to be enjoyed could have made better cinematography by hoytema was a work of wonder nolan didnt use any great graphics or anything he used limited amount of visual effects concentrating more on the subject so this film will be a better experience for the ones who believe that content of the film is more important than visual effects interstellar is more of an experience than a film missing this film on big screen will end in deep regression special note to the ones who are going for this film in this film explorers are seen rotating their space ship usual audience may not be able to understand the theory behind it ie the creation of artificial gravity there are many such moments in the film which are related to deeper physics so before watching the film just go through the topics such as artificial gravity wormholes neutron star relativity time dilation and tesseract an idea about these topic make the interstellar experience an easier one i will be able to understand the film completely only after watching it again i am fully satisfied with this experience i will be a able to rate this film only after watching it again in this universe there is time there is space there is gravity and there is love among human beings which is much more powerful than all other universal parameters i thank christopher nolan for this interstellar experience thank you for reading my views about interstellar yours truly— sooraj
