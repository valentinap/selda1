in this movie a man is mistakenly accused in murdering his wife and her boyfriend. he ends up finding away to keep himself occupy and finally helps out his new found friend. i really like this movie because it does show you that the system can make a mistake just like everyone can. all people make mistakes and since the government is run by humans of course there are going to be flaws. i had watched this movie for the first time with my dad and i loved watching it since. it does show that when you are determined you can do anything you put your mind to. i think anyone who likes movies about prison or even about the judicial system will love this film.
