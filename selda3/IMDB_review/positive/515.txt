the best of movie of the rebirth of batman. the dark knight shows how being a vigilante is more dangerous than the comics have portrayed. a lunatic the joker has zero remorse for human life. batman and the jokers depth is made buy a horrific childhood like most of the secret law enforcement and killers that have been apart of our society. the two characters represent light and dark as they are yin/yang to each other. one cannot exist without the other. the movie shows how humanity is fragile in the midst of chaos. chaos can only be conquered or controlled with decisions that at the core represent the human spirit and our desire to fight for our right to live in peace and harmony.
