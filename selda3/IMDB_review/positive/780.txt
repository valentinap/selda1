just like the two previous this one explores a action packed adventure/fantasy world with a extremely well crafted story line thanks to jrr tolkien books. not every adaptation from book to movie lives up to the hype but lets just say this one is relatively close. if tolkien was alive today i think he would certainly be pleased about the outcome of this brilliant trilogy. this movie has all the right elements andis a boys dream and the entertainment value makes this move next to perfect for its genre. i dont need to brag the movie speaks for it self. eleven oscars is all time record high and only two other movies has reached that benchmark. this is a true adventure classic and i truly envy those who have not yet seen this remarkable movie they have a amazing movie experience awaiting them. enjoy 9.3/10
