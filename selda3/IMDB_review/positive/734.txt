my biggest beef was on so much missing about aragon and i found most of them in the dvd. one of the vital elements in the fellowships strategy is to draw saurons eye away from frodo and here aragons role is crucial. the last debate in the movie is totally inadequate in explaining the suicidal march to the black gate but the dvd makes it very clear with the additional scene of aragon revealing himself to sauron though the palantir. he is the bait that sauron cannot resist. another important aspect is that aragon comes into the city of minas tirith first and foremost as a healer not as a king. the kingship comes afterwards. this is again brought out in the additional scenes in the dvd although still missing a lot of details from the book. still disappointing even for the dvd is that so little is given to the story of eowyn and faramir. the dialogue through which they come to accept each other could very well be the most beautiful in the entire book. the few shots in the dvd that trace the development of their relationship are far from adequate although thats a least a slight improvement from the film version. another disappointment is aragons arrival at the pelennor fields which is hopelessly lame compared with the original treatment in the book: amidst the despair of the rohan and gondor soldiers in witnessing the approaching black ships aragons standard suddenly unfurls at the main mast: there flowered a white tree and that was for gondor
