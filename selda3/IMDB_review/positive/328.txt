this film is pure class. i do not want to give anything away but heath ledgers performance in this is the best performance i have ever seen in my lifetime. shame it overshadows gary oldmans amazing performance as well. every aspect of this film is amazing the ideas the performances and the screenplay i remember coming out of the cinema in pure shock of how good this movie is. need to watch. incredible. christopher nolan is a genius
