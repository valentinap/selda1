my brother had told me about this a month or two before it was to come out and i watched the trailer and found myself really looking forward to the film i love action films and the fact that my brother had described it as alex rider but better set my hopes pretty high and i was not disappointed matthew vaughn is a great director and it is an unspoken rule in my house that if stardust is on tv we must watch it and i also loved kick ass this film had the slight gore of the latter which is fine by me since ive always watched films like that and the characters and aspects that dont turn out to be how they look on the surface in my opinion the perfect balance has been achieved between comedy violence action and even tragedyseriousness the actors used are amazing in their parts and it is a star studded cast of michael cain colin firth samuel l jackson and mark strong but i think that taron egerton gives an amazing film debut performance ive read some reviews where it has been described as laddish and brash but what else can you expect from a 15 rated spy film based on teenager from south london? in fact eggsys contrast to the typical gentleman spy is what makes this film so good we need more films that are like this one and push boundaries on the genres that we are used to i came out of the cinema desperate to talk about it with my friends but none of them have seen it so i will have to think about how good it is by myself it is also the first film that i have come out of cinema desperate to actually buy a copy of the film
