this is my favorite movie of all time i was 15 when i first saw this at that time i didnt think movies could get any better than true lies pulp fiction changed that for me it set me on my quest to get a better knowledge of film from then on i wanted to see films that had a good plot and that showcased good acting it made me want to see good films ive said goodbye to those pathetic action and comedy movies i began to see the films of bergman scorsese deniro kubrick altman the list goes on and on 10 out of 10
