seeing shawshank as the imdb #1 did not surprise me a bit. this movie has the heart & soul to be a favourite for a long time to come. i like the reality of the unfairness of the whole situation. there is no glossing over the painful stuff. he was innocent but still jailed. he did get raped. his chance did get wiped out to have his story confirmed. what a waste. i read some people calling this a feel-good story. perhaps in the end but other than the relief of freedom there wasnt much to feel good about. talk about a hard-fought battle. and it isnt even over... his life is better than it was but still sucks considering everything he lost considering he can never go back considering he is always a fugitive... if youre feeling bummed out about your own life this is a good movie to watch to realize that things could always be worse.
