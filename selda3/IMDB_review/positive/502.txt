the dark knight is a revelation in film making-both comic book and regular. usually i give comic book movies slack since the actors arent meant to be brilliant he plot is not meant to be mind-bending and meaningful and the theme is supposed to be something along the lines of heroes will always be there to save the day. however if i give christopher nolans masterpiece the dark knight slack i would be driving myself insane to put an infinity out of ten for the rating. the dark knight needs no slack put on it it is a great film. starting off with the acting ill end with the joker alfred michael caine bruce wayne/batman christian bale lucius fox morgan freeman and harvey dent aaron eckhart pull off the second best part of the film the acting is...beautiful. yes these actors are beyond good however the main attraction is heath ledgers version of the joker. you feel as if ledger is actually as insane as the joker and his acting is beyond brilliant and beautiful to the thousandth power rip. however that is only the acting the plot is great and the theme is something we should all remember. i wont spoil anything though you deserve to watch this movie for yourself. or better yet it deserves for you to watch it. overall: the dark knight is quite possibly the best movie i have ever seen the acting plot theme directing-i could go on-is just magnificent. if you havent seen it simply because its a batman movie you are truly missing out. nolans work of art is so brilliant and good that the dark knight isnt even a batman movie anymore. if you havent seen it you are truly missing out on something extraordinary.
