this is one of the best batman movies that i have ever seen. i believe that they did a great job. i love dc and this movie was able to remind me why that was. because there are all kind of superheroes. there is only one batman. when you are able to that this role on to the fullest and truly be come the bat.that is when you can make some thing good in to something great. there are a many other good twist and turns. they will live you in shock.the bat will face challenges. some will make him strong and other will leave him almost broken. in these without the joker it would be so lame. he bring the hummer. why so serious batman has all that anyone needs. he with be the catalyst for the whole movie. i have never seen someone out side of the batman cartoon be this go as a joker. when you watch this movie it fell like the joker is real. when you bring to people together that can become the bat and joker that is when you have made as a batman movie this was a once in a life time movie i dont know if anyone could ever be a better joker. if you dont believe what im saying then you need to watch it for your self. the you will understand why i think batman is so great for your self. to me the dark knight should prove one thing to all people. six words only there must always be a batmon.
