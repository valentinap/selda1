this is a great movie. being the second movie in the dark knight trilogy this is definitely the best. yes it can be disturbing at certain times but once you get past the violence and the dark undertone its a great movie that anyone above the age of 11 can enjoy. also the actors in this movie are amazing heath ledger plays a great joker and even has the laugh down. he is by far the best portrayal of the joker. also christian bale is the best portrayal of batman that i have seen and im sure that many fans would agree. he has the voice the looks and the acting skills to pull off the most bad ass superhero of all time.
