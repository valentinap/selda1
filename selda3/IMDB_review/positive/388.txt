the shawshank redemption is one of the few movies adapted from books that turned out to be good .. or in this case brilliant. although the movie supposedly takes place somewhen in the 1950s i can easily imagine it being transferred to todays time and standards. the thing that is most fascinating about is is that the directors [and writers of course] didnt use extreme clich’©s - theres no black and white painting just numerous shades of grey. robbins and freeman both are perfect for their roles as are all of the supporting actors. finally i can understand why a certain movies gets a high ranking.
