one of the best movie i have watched ever not once stopped my breath when i watching all 3 parts for the first time. i could not wait to get herring and the next.. i like it because it has used imaginative and beautiful places. i really like movies made _ÑÊ_ÑÊby words. especially when it comes to humanity and its survival the beauty of nature is very well shown and the evil forces of darkness. moments in which people come together and trust each other are ostentation of goodness soon i have not seen a film like this and i think that it is not made _ÑÊ_ÑÊyet why ima very good producers and i am sure that soon something will come very impressive as the lord of the rings
