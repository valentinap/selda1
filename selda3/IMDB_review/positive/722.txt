my wife and myself parents of three little kids rarely get to go to the cinema. two weeks ago during our holidays we got my parent to babysit the little monsters so that we can finally get out again. taking a peek into the papers actually *real* papers i had no internet access :-  revealed that the dark knight was the only watchable movie playing in the small nearby town. somewhat reluctantly we decided to give it a try. what the hell we thought we are on holidays anyway why not check a kids movie sorry to all fans of previous batman movies but thats just what i think of them. boy were we surprised after the movie it took us a few minutes before we both burst out this is one of the best movies i ever saw i wont go into any details for the multitude of excellent comments on this board already presents this movie as it is: a masterpiece especially the performance of the late heath ledger joker was unbelievable posthumous oscar anyone i actually felt quite nervous and actually even a bit scared during some joker scenes - something i didnt experience that often in a movie theater and yet we both felt that quite a few lines of his could have been from us... :- its a must please go watch it either in a real movie theater or in a damn good home theater. while the special effects in this movie are just what they *should* be a mere vehicle to transport the message the atmosphere of the movie just wont come over if you watch it on a 19 monitor with your 5.1 headset on... :- id gladly pay again to see it one more time
