umm i am speechless or in this case typeless to not even describe how this movie is. there is a turn at every corner and i mean awesome freaking out heart stopping scary stuff. also there are several beautiful visual effects going on here like the spectacular batman-jumps-out-of-window- into-plane-with-chinese-crook-in-hand stunt. that was awesome. the hospital explosion was great as well and harvey dies if you watched the first movie then prepare to get your shoes socks and everything blown off then this is the movie for you. i really sorry that heath ledger died though. he was a great actor in this movie. just watch it dont hesitate watch it. good luck.
