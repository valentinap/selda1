when i went into kingsmen i had no idea what to think i had not doe my research and went into the theater with moderate expectations thinking i was going to see a mediocre cheesy movie about british spies but i was so wrong kingsmen is about a ultra secretive spy agency that is trying to save the world although a very common plot this movie was made so that is was very unique despite a clich_ plot the longer i was watching the movie i kept on realizing how much i loved the movie it was filled with unique action an unforeseen plot and a great quirkiness that enhances the film so much along with all of these features the movie was filled with a class a cast it was a very well neededwellrounded movie
