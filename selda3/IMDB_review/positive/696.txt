of all the movies i must say that this had the best visual effects. this was my most beloved book and to see it come to life on screen was absolutely amazing. peter jackson once again worked his magic. the characters are still as amazing as ever. legolas has incredible stunts that make you want to stand up and cheer. eowyn becomes a hero. merry and pippin arent up to there usual mischief. gandalf is as awesome as ever. aragorn is a very important role in the film. gimli still brings some comic relief into the film. and arwen is still as fair as ever. this film is a must see by all lovers of tolkien although you must expect to see a few scenes missing the houses of healing the scouring of the shire and a couple others. it goes without saying that peter jackson brought home the gold with this one...literally. he won best director at the golden globes and the film won best dramatic film at the golden globes. now they need to bring home the little bald guy oscars on february 29 2004. film rating: 10/10
