seriously this was one of the greatest films i have ever seen. plain and simple. im not saying it did not have some silly stupid stuff in it that i could have done without but overall what a movie ledgers joker will never be topped. every scene in the movie that did not have joker in it i was sitting there going whens the joker coming back. i just simply could not get enough of the character. he was so deep and so true to form. i could not have asked for anything more from ledgers performance. i would have rathered the movie have been rated r and seen a little more gore because i think thats the only thing the joker was not able to display was his cruelty. but still a fantastic performance. oscar worthy i dont know but its got to be the closest any comic book performance has gotten to being oscar worthy. most of my guesses at the plot line were right on. bale can over act a bit at times. but none of it matters. ledger steals the movie and everything else takes a back seat to his performance.
