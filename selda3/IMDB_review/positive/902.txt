im not a wellknown film critic but this is my first film that i have gave a ten out of ten rating we all know that its that time of the year again for production companies to start pumping out their best material for the academy award season some companies think their is a system to putting together a great film other companies actually take the time to put together a great film crew and good actors this was one of those companies consider this film a headstart on david finchers race to an award for best director or best picture either one is fine everything about this film is almost perfect to the directing editing acting even the font for the credits
