this movie is an instant classic. everything about it is perfect - the acting the special effects the plot the music and the complete and utter emotion it contains. it will be remembered for years to come and its story will be passed down for generations. i have seen hundreds and hundreds of movies and this one will always be my favorite. this is the movie i will show to my children and tell them how great it is until they tire of hearing about it from me. i have grown up reading the books and this movie did not disappoint. nothing else has come close and nothing ever will. i hope for everyone to enjoy this movie and cherish it as i have and will. kudos peter jackson. continue to amaze and inspire us with your work.
