i was incredibly happy with the way peter jackson did the last installment of lord of the rings. he kept all the major plot occurences from the book and transformed them into a visual presentation of the book the ending was so parallel to the boo kthat it had near the same affect of instilling emotion into me as the book did. therefore i think that rotk is one of the best movies this year and in the history of filmmaking.
