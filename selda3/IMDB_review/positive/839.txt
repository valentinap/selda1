it is the most great film in the history of american cinema. robbins and freeman are fantastic. it implants hope in our soul. friendship relation between the robbins and freeman in the film is very nice. i know that movie is the first in the imdb schedule  and its really worth it. when i watch any movie i always return to your appreciation of it and relied upon but in this film ive seen just so i said it deserved to be the best and when i returned to the evaluation have really found is also.but i do not know why did not achieve high income while movie display but perhaps it was due to have been introduced in the early nineties of the last century and the film does not usually attracts young researcher substance or sexual violence.
