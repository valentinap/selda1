tarantino really nails it with this all-time classic there is really nothing wrong with this movie the acting is amazing with samuel jackson giving his best performance ever the story is immaculate and the directing is unbeatable the editing and directing go hand-in-hand with the unique pacing and grueling dialog tarantino definitely is the master behind a camera there are twist and turns throughout this movie that make your head spin the long dialog scenes reads tarantino all over it and also the thick blood and crazy death scenes i give this movie a 10/10 because it really shows what great acting editing camera work and directing can do to create such a perfect movie
