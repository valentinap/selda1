this movie is one that gives to wit the most part of being happy in this life. it is true that you might not be lucky enough in life but even in the midst of crap even when all your life has crumbled over your face hope is still your last hope. one night he caught his wife cheating and was thrown in jail for a murder that he had not committed and after all that he got raped what would you have done had you been in his shoes keep on hoping well andy not only had hope he gave hope to his fellow prisoners. the brilliant morgan freeman gives the cherry on the top in this movie and if he werent in this movie the movie would have lacked something for sure. there are scenes and lines that you will never forget in this movie and i have commented on hundreds of movies but very few i gave the full 10 out of 10 and this movie is one of those few.
