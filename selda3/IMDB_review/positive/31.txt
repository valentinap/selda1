with well adapted characters more direction than a compass and loads more power than a puch from mike tyson this film is an absolute must-see. tarintino the director which brought us reservior dogs and true romance has created what i claim as a top 10 in cinematic history.  casablanca one flew over the cuckoos nest raging bull the godfather reservoir dogs schindlers list tgtbtu taxi driver goodfellas l.a confidential apocalypse now fight club and so on and so forth. i would recommend this or the godfather for any person that wants to get in movies. since both are classics and impossible to dislike. 11/10
