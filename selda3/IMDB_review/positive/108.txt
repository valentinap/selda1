what a complete masterpiece this film is from the first line spoken to the zoom-out in the end. the actors are all great but morgan freeman and tim robbins really do outstanding performances. this is probably my all time favorite film and to anyone who hasnt seen it theres only one thing i can say: please do you wont be disappointed.
