this is one of those movies where after the it ends you will say that was 2 hours well spent action begins from the go and it is very realistic or at least they have made it look realistic on the screen unlike some other similar movies there is no flying or gravity defying moves here its more of a close combat and that really intrigued me precision perfect stunts and amazing cinematography with a touch of humor will definitely make you come alive the characters in the movie are really appealing a notable candidate would be the super villain calmhumorous and villainous all at the same time loved his character even though the movie is action packed it comes with a good story a very good one in fact so the bottom line is this is a great movie and worth your time
