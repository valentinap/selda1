its hard to put in words how much i love this movie but here it goes. pulp fiction is an absolute masterpiece. a story thats told in non-linear fashion and keeps you guessing what will happen next...even if youve viewed it before. its so amazing that its nearly flawless where to begin where to begin. the dialog is interesting yet realistic. rather than giving us frequent exposition which most filmmakers suffer from tarantino has found a way for his memorable characters to discuss pointless things that are fascinating to listen to while developing strong character traits. the movies time-line is complex but to summarize it in one sentence it shifts around both forward and backwards between sequences. the direction is sure-handed and tarantino isnt afraid to hold a shot that flows smoothly with the way its edited. the casting is first-rate this is the movie that helped revive john travoltas career and made the rest of the actors reputable to the hollywood system. for those who are concerned about the level of violence its actually not as graphic as it seems. yes its intense but if you look closely the content of it isnt gratuitous or repulsive. gene siskel touched upon this in one of his reviews with roger ebert. for example bruce willis swipes a man with a samurai sword. the victim is faced away from the camera so you dont see the weapon attack him. then when willis stabs the sword into the guys knee its out of frame and we only hear the sound effect & see his reaction. dont worry im wrapping this up. if you can surpass the hype and enjoy it for what it is you are going to have a fun two hours. hope you see it after reading this and enjoy your tasty burger
