i see that 700 and some people have given this movie a rating of 1 what a bunch of melarchy there is so much packed into pulp fiction that most movies asked to deliver the same would buckle under the weight the acting is great its nice to see travolta in a real movie the editing and story boarding are classic actually they helped redefine the term classic in the genre excellent movie a must see [perfect 10] rip mike sackman
