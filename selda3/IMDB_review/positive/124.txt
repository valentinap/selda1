well as the other more than 2000 review say it in my opinion this is the best movie created so far. it basically just how life is: you get punched in a face time to time but you have to stand up keep your hope and give value to your fellows because in return life takes care about your reward. oh yes and if you face any evil that you can stop do it. this is the message of the film if we follow it life may be as rewarding ultimately for us as for the hero. other films that moved me like this: forrest gump the curious case of benjamin button. imdb says i have to write another line in order for them to post my review so here it is xd
