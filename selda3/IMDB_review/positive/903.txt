im not a disney fan i never cared for the princess themed films i never understood why the queen in snow white or maleficent in sleeping beauty were at all threatened in beauty or charm or intellect by the youth in each film this film is absolutely brilliant it finally shows a view that makes sense from a story telling stand point it shows the grace and charm of a character who is not a princess by title and it has a clear beginning middle and end for all motivation on the part of principle characters this might be one of the single best narrated film in the entire history of disney and perhaps of all time this might be the single best character actress performance by angelina jolie since gia or possibly of her entire career this cast might be the most simplistic yet perfect cast ever put together to tell a small story in a tremendously beautiful way with universal messages that cross all relationships i knew i would appreciate jolie on the big screen what i didnt know is that the story is by its telling in this film now a classic story anything including the original animated version pales by comparison i cant say its the greatest film ive seen or the best this year or any of those things because it can not be put into any of those categories nor compared to any other film this film in some way i believe simply by the story itself and how it is told stands apart from any film ive seen in quite possibly decades i saw it went out to the box office got another ticket and saw it again and i plan to see it again if possible i saw the 2d version i am not a 3d or imax person and i am not a fan of bluray but this film needs to be seen in any and all formats if you thought the lord of the rings films or the hobbit films were beautifully done they cant even be compared to the telling of this tale maleficent might be the most brilliantly told story ive seen in my entire life and ive seen many many films in many genres i want to read it as it is told in the film and i think in the telling this version is the only version need ever be told absolutely magnificent im spellbound
