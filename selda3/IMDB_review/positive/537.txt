such an amazing movie. its a movie that you can watch over and over. only thing that i hate is the way christian bale speaks when he is batman. apart from that i love all batman films starring christian bale. favourite character is the joker heath ledger. such ashame he isnt here anymore though the dark knight rises is also a great film and for all of yous who havent seen it should go watch it now havent heard if they are making another one or not but i really hope that they are such an amazing series and i want more like i said the only thing i dont like about the films is the way chrisitan bale speaks when he is batman. but yeah its amazing
