my wife and i went to boyhood on its opening day in christchurch new zealand we had recently seen the trailer and were keen to see the film it did not disappoint us the acting was excellentso good that at times we found we forgot we were watching a movie rather than a documentary it was great to see an understated american movie rather than the overblown dialogue* and direction we so often seehear its a long movie but time just flew we have two adult sons and although life and culture in nz is not the same as shown in boyhood we found many situations in the movie which struck a chord for us i would write more but other reviewers have expressed it much better than i suffice it to say of all the movies i have seen in the last 68 years this one goes straight into my top 10 *what i call the seinfeld syndrome theres a joke coming raise eyebrows look at camera    did you get thatill say it again
