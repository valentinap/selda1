if you want a new story youll be disappointed if however you want the classic story retold in a beautiful simple way this will easily satisfy you we all know the story right? why mess with it? there are a few small additions mainly at the beginning to set the story we know and love but the majority of it is a reproduction of everything we cherish in my opinion thats a good thing my whole family thought maleficent was magnificent in the way it turned a story we knew on its side cinderella on the other hand we all loved because it embraced the classic plot without twisting it into something it is not visually the movie was incredible both my girls my wife and daughter thought everything looked exactly as they dreamed it should that is an enormous compliment probably their biggest complaint was that the trailers showed too many of the visual elements they wanted to be surprised with the unveiling of cinderellas dresses and the like other than that there was hardly any complaints go ahead and see the cinderella you know its wonderful
