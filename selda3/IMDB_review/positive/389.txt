the shawshank redemption is one of the best movies i have ever watched in my life. tim robbins is really a good actor and thanks to him this movie is such a success. also morgan freeman is really brought me the story. the story is excellentthe time has just flew with this movie. this movie just gets better with every showing. theres no some special effects and that is just great-just men in prison uniforms talking to each other. everyone must watch this movie.the shawshank redemption and to kill a mockingbird are the best movies i have ever seen. i do not judge it by its technical merits - i dont really care about that. i have read that citizen kane or the godfather or this or that movie is the best movie ever made. they may have the best technique or be the most influential motion pictures ever made but not the best. the best movies are ones that touch the soul. it takes a movie like the shawshank redemption to touch the soul.
