the first thing that came to my mind when i left the theater was oh man that movie was f#$@ awesome this movie is unbelievable. it is different from other superhero movies mostly because of its plot and the great dialogs but also the way the action scenes are presented. nolan has done a very good job and there is no way you will get bored or tired of the endless action. however the one and only feature that makes this film special is the enemy. the joker has become even more popular after the dark knight and became maybe the most likable villain. his goal isnt money or power he wants to see the gotham destroyed and corrupt its people as more as he can. but what makes him unique is that instead of killing batman which would make him reach his goal much easier he enjoys playing with him and torture him not physically but mentally. the awesomeness of this character completes with heath ledgers epic performance delivering the role of his lifetime. in my opinion this is by far the best superhero movie but also one of the best movies ive ever seen. if you like superhero movies you will love it if you are not a big fun of this kind but you enjoy a good action movie_Ñ_ you will love it
