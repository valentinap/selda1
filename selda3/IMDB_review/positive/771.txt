lets get straight to the point. the plot is set out to perfection. it doesnt rush itself and tells the story brilliantly. the way it elegantly portrays the jokers sick humour when threatening the 2 boats containing prisoners and citizens. not to mention the tension when one boat has to blow up the other leaves you hanging on the edge of your seat. the film also shows that batman is shown not be a unbeatable hero and has a side of realism that christopher nolan directs really well. but my favourite thing about the dark knight is the excellent acting of the late heath ledger and his role of the joker is quirky sinister and what makes the dark knight one of my favourite films of all time.
