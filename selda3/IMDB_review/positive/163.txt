this was the best batman movie ever. rip heath ledger but he brought the joker character to life. i personally would have called it the joker instead of batman because if it wasnt for the joker then the movie would have been boring.however i did enjoy a lot of the action scenes like the opening of the movie when the men with the clown masks were breaking into the bank. also the scene when the joker is trying to kill the comissioner & batman ties the rope around the vehicle & it flips forward. i thought that was a very cool special effect.i wonder if they are going to add robin as batmans side kick in the next one. cant wait to see the next chapter.
