the greatest movie ever made.. period. pure and simple it is what every director hope to achieve. the film will keep you glued to your seat if you know what it means.it will bring tears to your eyes. it will make you think how you have lived your life so far...or in fact how you have wasted it. it will teach you the value of freedom which we enjoy without giving a second thought. and it will leave you with a sense of happiness which you will experience only rarely. the performances are simply mind boggling be it tim robbins or morgan freeman or countless others. and it is difficult to believe this was the debut of frank darabont as a director.if you havent already seen it... please do otherwise you are missing something.
