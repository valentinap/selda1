some people are a bit hesitant to watch this movie due to the length of it and the tendency for the first movie to drag on a bit but even if you found the first 2 movies to be a bit boring for your taste you should by no means hesitate to watch this movie. the return of the king is the most beautifully made movie every piece of the movie from the story to the action to the visual effects to the acting is just absolutely stunning. i have personally been looking for movies that can provide the same experience that this movie provides and there is clearly no match. the movie concludes the lord of the rings series showing everyones final push to end the reign of sauron. the movie starts off with the story of how gollum came to be which if you ask me has been long overdue but a great addition. the movie then continues to show the struggle frodo is having bearing the influence of the ring and sam continues to show his support for frodo despite gollums attempts to undermine sam and trick frodo. the rest of the cast find out that sauron has plans to destroy gondor and each contribute a role to stop saurons army. the movie continues to drag you to the edge of your seat when i first saw it i wished that the movie wouldnt end but when it did it left a satisfying bittersweet feeling for those who followed frodo from the shire in the beginning. if you havent watched it put it on your list you wont regret it.
