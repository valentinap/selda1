pulp fiction continues to top lists of the best movies ever it continues to mesmerize everybody that sees it it continues to be seen as the best movie the cast has ever been in and the best movie tarantino ever directed people that either watch movies on occasion or watch movies as hobbies love this people with thorough knowledge of film love it even more i would consider pulp fiction to be the best film of the 1990s beating out other classic in that decade such as schindlers list and terminator 2 like most tarantino films he does not put everything in chronological order that is a genius movie on his behalf that forces the viewer to stay until the end even those very very very few that dont like pulp fiction were obligated to stay till the end that is also what made tarantinos first movie reservoir dogs so thrilling also tarantino shows his knack for awesome dialogue that only he can deliver pulp fiction has three parallel story lines: the first deals with a couple called ringo and pumpkin tim roth amanda plummer that are also thieves they open up the film discussing the pros and cons of robbing a restaurant the scene is brief but the characters and dialogue is memorable vincent vega and jules winfield john travolta samuel l jackson are two hit men sent to retrieve a briefcase for their boss marcellus wallace ving rhames containing a golden object that is not shown nor told another genius movie on tarantinos behalf a few deaths and survivals along the way have them questioning their beliefs this is probably the funniest story pulp fiction has sometimes been labelled as a dark comedy this is the story with most of its elements this also has the one with the best and grittiest look soon after the incident vincent is asked to entertain wallaces wife mia uma thurman while he is out of town they have a good time until she overdoses on heroin that vincent got from his drug dealer lance eric stoltz although a small story the dialogue is just as sick as in the other stories and the character development is very deep although this is the only bit with mia she is developed deeper and stronger than many characters in full films the last is about club fighter butch coolidge bruce willis wallace pays him a hefty sum to throw a fight but after having a crazy dream bets the money on himself and fights so hard that he kills his opponent he goes on the run with his girlfriend maria de medeiros from wallace this is the story with the most excitement and the least amount of comedy some bits are shocking but all fit together bruce willis as butch is just as badass and heroic as john mcclane as i mentioned earlier the all stories are done out of order but are all tied in in a very intelligent way writing memorable dialogue like this is very hard creating awesome characters is even harder while making the movie look good and putting it out of order is the easy part pulp fiction has everything a good movie should have to the extreme that barely any other have achieved only tarantino could do a movie this good
