i thought this was probably the last one ill see. i really liked this one i recommend it i just think they are never going to be the same after this one because of heath ledgers late passing. i really appreciate the acting selection. i have seen every batman up until this point excluding some of the cartoons and i believe that my kids will watch this i just think they are getting too dark these day so i actually walked out of the last one. i can kind of see me going back i had some beer before i entered into the theater so perhaps that just made me sleepy but overall i think this on the one before the one i walked out on was pretty good. nice job. thumbs up to the casting director. real big thumbs up there
