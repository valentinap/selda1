ive seen the dark knight many times. once you start watching it you just cant stop. -batman begins was the perfect change for the usual batman - atmosphere. - -it was easy for us to accept things in the dark knight because of the first movie. -the dark knight was the best of the trilogy because of heath ledger. -the dark knight rises was surely one of the best movies in 2012. but honestly without the dark knight the trilogy wouldnt have been nearly as popular as it is now. also christopher nolans name suddenly is all over the planet.
