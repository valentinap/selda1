it starts out with two talking about job it continues with two people talking about job actually all this movie shows are two people doing their job but these are different people throughout the film tim roth and amanda plummer give a good reminiscent view of true romance while john travolta and cool coiffured samuel l jackson simply do a job - it is just that their job is killing people their killing scene is one of the most nerve wrecking imaginable especially for the victims due to jacksons quite eccentric behavior bruce willis and ving rhames turn from partners in betrayal to enemies to partners in revenge in an unheard of plot twisting sequence the flic actually looks more difficult than it is by far we have three stories woven into one apart from the pre-credit intro and the subsequent travolta / jackson opening stories #2 and#3 are told first and then rounded out by #1 #2 vincent vega and marsellus wallaces wife shows what could have been - under different circumstances - the beginning of a romance and what turns into pure horror due to mixed-up addictions #3 the gold watch shows prize fighter willis who - more or less - accidentally breaks a deal and thus is not longer safe in town before he can run away he has to go back to his apartment to pick up his gold watch that his girl-fiend had forgotten after an encounter with travolta he bumps into ving rhames whom he had the deal with after this the movie gets really weird - and good then in #1 we are shown travolta and jackson who kill a few guys who did wrong witness a miracle and see a quite normal business day turned into bulls**t when travolta loses control of his finger - enter tarantino and keitel the movie ends with plummer and roth in a different-angle version of the pre-credit sequence what makes this movie really good are the dialogues plummer / roth travolta / jackson travolta / thurman willis / rhames willis / taxi driver angela jones keitel / tarantino and sequences like the christopher walken scene this movie is so good that nobody misses the box fight which could have made a good scene all in all this is a true cinematic masterpiece
