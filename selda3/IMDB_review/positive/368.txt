the trilogy of the lord of the rings is the best trilogy ever made and it is amazing... of course that dont have everything that are in the books like: -tom bombadil -barrow wights -erkenbrand -the grey company -the gondor reinforcements in ships from other cities -the lords of gondor like elphir hirluin... -dol amroth and prince imrahil and their charge to help the rohirrim -battle in the shire -the scout of gondor that send the red arrow -ghan-buri-ghan and his people -sam use the ring and other things but the movies arent the book is not because of that that the movie is better or worse the movie is an adaptation not the book... my advice 1st of all is to you see the extended versions have some more and cool details that make the trilogy better : the scenarios are amazing the mountains and all this the backgrounds are amazing i think it was a great production : so my congratulations to the all people that act indirect or direct in the movie and all the fans of tolkien that make possible all this huge success... now wait for the hobbit : in short words: lotr -> epic : sy for my english portuguese here regards rodolfo fernandes costa
