the acting in the dark knight was very well done as was the directing. heath ledgers joker was exactly how i think the joker should be played and his characteristics were perfect. christian bale was also playing the perfect part. i think that the dark knight was a lot better than batman begins i think the dark knight had more depth to it. every part of this film was brilliant the music the acting the atmosphere everything personally my favourite scene was the opening scene as it sets the film up perfectly. which is why im choosing that scene for my gcse film studies coursework. i think that this is one of the best films i have ever seen. the best film of the year and possibly the decade.
