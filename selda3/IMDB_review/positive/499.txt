the dark knight is an amazing movie the script is very well written the acting the visual effects its really hits you on an emotional level which is something most films dont do nowadays. i recommend it to everyone who loves batman even if you dont like batman youll still love this movie. it is probably christopher nolans most successful films next to inception. if you want to be emerged in a real life gotham then this is the movie to see though the old batman films portray a very comic book-like gotham this one shows that anything including the villains even batman is very possible to happen. if you enjoyed the origin youll most definitely like this one. it has your action adventure comedy thrown in and out throughout the movie and even your romance.
