i went into this movie with a high standard because of all of the movies nominations and awards that critics have approved as a deserving addition to this movies accomplishments i also had skeptics on the plot as it was considered to be basic and that nothing really happens but where it hit me most was at the end where i could look back on these chapters of this kids life that made it interesting and worth wild to have all these experiences that a normal kid should have of course since the title of the movie is boyhood it focuses mainly on the boys early life but i feel that a diverse audience can find something relatable stir up some emotions as supporting characters effect and intertwine with the boy the dialog also adds to the realistic downtoearth atmosphere that the audience can immerse in and feel comfortable in though this movie neither focuses on really though times in the boys life or even the greatest of his childhood it shows how important the present moment is and to be able to look back on a memory and enjoy the life you have overall this movie was something i thought about for a while if a movie can do that and sort of change me personally i believe this to be worthy of its acclaimed recognition
