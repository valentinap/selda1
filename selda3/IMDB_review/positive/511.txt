the chief conceit of boyhoodfollowing the same characters over twelve filmed yearswould be little more than a gimmick in a lesser directors hands but under richard linklaters gentle guidance it becomes a singular achievement a film as freshly conceived as it is entertaining and thoughtful linklaters primary concern here is time and the ways we process our awareness of it his conclusionthat we are really of the momentseems borne out by the episodic way in which he depicts a child ellar coltrane who seems to grow into the role as he ages ultimately becoming remarkable simply by being identifiable experiencing events both mundane and lifechanging encounters with alcoholic stepfathers are the films most harrowing sequences and you can see coltranes impressions of them being burnished into him coltranes wonderful performance its hard to believe hes actually acting is enhanced by equally impressive work by patricia arquette and surprisingly the usually pretentious ethan hawke the directors daughter lorelei linklater is an absolute delight the film takes its time searching for its ending when it finds it its simple and openended fully appropriate and moving linklater has always been able to zigzag effectively throughout his career effortlessly navigating between hollywood entertainments dazed and confused school of rock and more personal esoteric work waking life before sunrise boyhood seems a watershed moment for him a rumination on what the universality of his themes has meant to himand in their ease and eloquence what they mean to us i cannot recommend this film highly enough
