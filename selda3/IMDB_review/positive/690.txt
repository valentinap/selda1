on every level acting photography sound costumes direction and plot you are absorbed into the story. it is as fresh today as the day i saw it in the cinema and has yet to be bettered in its genre. you as the audience believe that the actors arent merely reciting the dialogue but have become each character they represent. peter jackson could so have easily followed the blockbuster formula to conclude the film with an epic battle but we are respected as fellow members of the story/crew and given the entirety of the story. though it completes the story i was very unhappy it had to end as you want to know what happens next over all the leading characters lifetimes. this is a totally outstanding epic which will be enjoyed for decades to come.
