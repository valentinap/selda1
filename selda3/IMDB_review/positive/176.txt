this one is by far the best of all batman-movies in my opinion. it has suspense right from the start and keeps you gripped till the end.the acting is simply brilliant. heath ledgers joker is the coolest villain ever and for me it is the best acting performance in the movie history apart that the directing from christopher nolan is amazing. the staging and screenplay is fabulous. you dont want to miss this one out even if you do not like superheroes surely one of the best movies ever. not my personal best but it is definitely in the top 10 so to all you movie lovers: if you have not seen this one yet do it now
