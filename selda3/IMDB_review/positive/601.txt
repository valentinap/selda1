pulp fiction truly changed my life the fragmented presentation of the movie in stories superb dialogue the fact that the settings and characters are just so cool and many other film-making touches makes this movie magnificent it made me realise actually how much i love movies the first aspect to take note of when you watch the movie will be when you see the cast at the time seeing john travoltas name acting as the supposed leading role in the film saw the resurgence of his career and he acted brilliantly its the one role he plays where on sometimes forgets its the famous john travolta acting enthusiasts of other tarantino films will recognise harvey keitel tim roth from his other works and if one is really sharp steve buscemi and even christopher walken samuel l jackson was to show the world how good an actor he is in this movie also amongst the cast names in the opening credits at the very end after about 12 names comes bruce willis last undoubtedly not least a noticeable touch the script is of epic proportions tarantino and avary created stories which especially the last two can be appreciated in many ways with powerful significance dialogue is superb throughout bringing both astute humour and reality to the picture the music chosen surely makes the soundtrack one of the best of all time i love and appreciate literally every shot in the movie there is only one line in the film i dont like when rachel talks back to say good night rachel is the only part of the entire film i dont like and the line fits perfectly with the character i just hate the character the more you watch this film the more one gets out ive seen it over 50 times and i get something new out of it almost every time from script interpretations to things one doesnt have a chance to see or hear the first time it was made so that it would be appreciated for the multiple viewer there is much more i could add but most has all been said before ill end by saying seeing certain movies can bring great personal moments this movie can be seen as a great asset to the world of film in my opinion its the greatest ever made
