it is really amazing movie i have ever seen in my lifetime. the cast and the story of the movie are really successful. andy is a passionate character and he is convicted of murdering his wife and her lover despite his claims of innocence. it is so touching to spend almost two decades in the prison. old-fashioned prisons in the 90s are full of bad guy who dont expect anything from the life. and  they dont think how we escape here. however
