it is great how they portrait the joker with his jokes and smiling. the whole entire movie is rally good drama. every cut-scenes is carefully taken and well prepared and i think is really awesome. the fighting is great to even thought you dont see so much fighting in this film because i have always think of the batman is more like a cool detective dress up as a bat that uses really cool toys. i dont know exactly if this film follows any comic book because i havent read any of them but i like how they introduce the joker and two face. the its film based more in a way of curing the city of the criminal activity and gangs which i think is great.
