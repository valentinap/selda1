one of the classic movie ever made. lots of enthusiasm is shown in the movie apart from all the suffering prisoners have to face. must watch movie. still capturing the box office. shawshank is a true story and a must watch for any new member. tim robbins has done a fantastic job including morgan freeman. the story line of the movie is really more biased then any other top bench marking movie. stephen kings story is brought to the screen with great elegance and excitement. it is an extraordinary motion that people will be talking about in 50 or 100 years.no action no special effects - just men in prison uniforms talking to each other. the shawshank redemption and to kill a mockingbird are the best movies i have ever seen. i do not judge it by its technical merits - i dont really care about that. i have read that citizen kane or the godfather or this or that movie is the best movie ever made. they may have the best technique or be the most influential motion pictures ever made but not the best. the best movies are ones that touch the soul. it takes a movie like the shawshank redemption to touch the soul.
