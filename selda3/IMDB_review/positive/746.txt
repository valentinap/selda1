maybe im writing a review too late for this movie but i think i must write something for this. shawshank redemption is a truly a class movie that teaches us many things like friendship and never gave up your hope. unlike other users i think this movie deserves to be in imdb top 250 list. today imdbs top 250 list approved and considered by everyone. so everybody must see that this movie is in top and must watch it to see why imdb puts this movie on top and not godfather. i really like the role of red by morgan freeman. he really acts like a experienced jail-mate. andy dufresne is okay too. what i really like is that i really love the end. maybe this is the best ending ever. i really like how red laughs to andy about pickaxe and andy dig 19 years  wow  to made a hole in the wall how he escape and become a person he made it up for wardens dirty job how his dreams come true and lastly after 5 years in jail after andy escaped how red not decided to suicide decided to follow andy. best movie ever... 10/10
