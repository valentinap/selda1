the lord of the rings: the return of the king in my view has to be one of the best if not the bestconclusions to any trilogy in movie making history. when i first heard that peter jackson had begun filming the lotr films i was a little apprehensive as id not long finished reading the books. i thought there was no way hed be able to do them justice and that the films would go the same way as many trilogys had gone before by starting on a high but sadly lacking at the end. my apprehension however was not needed. the return of the king stayed more or less quite true to the books. the size and scale of the battles is immense and the sets scenery and cgis are thoroughly stunning.i cant wait until the extended version comes out on dvd so as to see the bits that had to be omitted due to time constraints. peter jackson can now sit among the big boys of direction and i only hope that if he gets the go ahead for the hobbit it will be made in the same style and panache as the lotr trilogy. i would recommend lord of the rings: return of the king to anyone
