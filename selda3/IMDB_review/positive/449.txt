the lord of the rings - the two towers is truly an amazing film and the middle part of the sweeping lord of the rings saga of films by peter jackson. it is obviously very highly rated and critically acclaimed but for whatever reason it is not as loved as the first and third parts of the lord of the rings franchise. the first part obviously sets everything up and begins the journey and part three is all about the climax and resolution with some obviously really huge stuff going on but part two has just as much action. id rank them: part 3 then part 2 then part 1 in order of enjoyment and how much action there was in each film. my only downside for part two is that it ends kind of abruptly in a weird place it would have been better to have the story go a bit longer in part two instead of saving the spider etc and so much more for part three.
