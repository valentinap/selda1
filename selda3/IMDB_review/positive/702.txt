now after about 9 and a half years after we first watched the lord of the rings: the return of the king i and my friends decided to have a tolkien movie marathon watching the lord of the rings trilogy and the hobbit. as much as i adore tolkiens book and jacksons movies this is my absolute favorite. this is it you now the war saurons fall and aragorn becoming king. the top of the movie the absolute thrill is the arrival of the dead commanded by aragorn and its just a joyful felling watching them through minas tirith killing orcs. the cast is great but my favorite is sir ian mckellan. i thin he should have won an oscar for this role. hope that the hobbit 2 and 3 will be better. absolute success for jackson for that he has found inspiration in tolkiens book cause i dont think anybody else would have given us movies and cast as good as it is now.. so for that bravo cantt wait for the second hobbit movie :p
