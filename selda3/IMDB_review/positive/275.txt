this is the best batman movie out there. heath ledger as the joker was the perfect choice as he made joker almost real. he became the joker and i was so fascinated about his acting skills. such a shame he has past away r.i.p heath ledger. i love christian bale as batman he was a really great choice and i dont really care about how the voice is overrated as people say its really good anyway. the only thing i would have loved was more scarecrow in the movie. even in the dark knight rises and in batman begins i wanted more scarecrow because cillian murphy is such a brilliant actor as scarecrow. this is my favorite movie. everyone should have seen it once at least. in my case ive seen it over 30 times.
