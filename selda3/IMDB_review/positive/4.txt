you know its really not the most entertaining movie ever made. you might look around the theater and see people yawning or even sleeping i guess its not avatar where you get cgi things or these 3d animation movie they make these days nor any batman or superman thing to thrill you with the action. what makes this motion picture special is that you will grow to love this movie  the first time you walk out of threatre you may not think of it as the greatest movie ever made  but theres something about it which makes you see it again and again and each time you see it you learn something new from it. you may be impressed by these great budget movie they make these days but you surely wont watch it a hundred times literally. count my words you will watch this movie that many times. its a story about hope as many people have already said in the review also about friendship and almost all these great human emotions. great great soundtrack by thomas newton is like a cherry on the cake. the movie is so realistic and so much real at places it actually makes you angry yet its not a depressing movie like schindlers list or a fairy tale one like forrest gump  its just a story which gives you hope and strength to face life and value it. believe me lol i have watched a lot of movies and this is the best one.
