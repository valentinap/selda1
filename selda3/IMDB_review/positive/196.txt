this movie is unpredictableif you avoid the many movie clips that is it is heartwarming yes it has action yes they also mixed in a lot of comedy and adventure it has a little romancevery little it is well written with great special effects and so it is really easy to recommend to the pg13 movie crowd i intend to buy it the second it comes out marvel and disney are going to make a ton of money on this excellent film it is the best of all the marvel films they have done i state that not owning one comic book or reading anything at all about this characters i hope they start working on the sequel as soon as possibleand that they keep the same writers and the same director
