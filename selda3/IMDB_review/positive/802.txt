its very rare that you find such diversity in a movie now days. i like the story and its concept.a thumping good ode to friendship hope wit wiles and wisdom brimming with crackling characters and topped with the most twister of twists since the crying game. the shawshank redemption is a powerful and uplifting not to mention oscar-worthy film. in 2006 it was ranked as the greatest film ever by empire a film magazine. the year it came out it was nominated for 7 academy awards but did not win a single one because of a movie you may all remember forrest gump. its the no-bull performances that hold back the flood of banalities. robbins and freeman connect with the bruised souls of andy and red to create something undeniably powerful and moving. some of the shawshank redemption comes across as outrageously improbable. yet the film keeps pulling you back with its sense of striving humanity slowly turning the tables against evil.
