i think pulp fiction is the geatest gangster movie of all time i like mob films but this is the best in history it is extremley bloody films i think that samuel jackson bruce willis and travolta have acted their best in the film i am big fan of this film and i would put it in the top 3 of my favourite my favorite part is where jules shoots bret in the arm that part is actually quite funny i would definitely rate this as a ten if there was a rating over ten it would go to the top i think the 3 actors and quentin tarantino a adding part of the movie
