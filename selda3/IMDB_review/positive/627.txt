pulp fiction is a 1994 crime-drama directed and written by quentin tarantino staring jon travolta and samuel l jackson as two bamfs and bruce willis as butch let me just say before i dig into this that i have a massive bias to this movie ive seen pulp more than any other movie in fact the reason why i even took this class in the first place can be directly linked to my admiration for pulp that being said tarantino really showed that hes got game in this film many people say that hes just a really big fan simply steals shots from other directors and one can certainly see the similarities between the shots but tarantino manages to make it his own every time even if the set up is exactly the same the shots he uses are able to stay tarantino- esque its also hard to point out one particular thing in this movie that stands out as the cinematography editing sound story acting and even the wardrobe stands out what makes this movie different from the rest is the non-conventional showing of the story its non-linear its almost aggressively non-linear for years ive been trying to figure out what the order in which the stories are told mean im sure theres something there but i havent really been able to figure it out that being said though it doesnt hold the movie back at the end of the day this movie is everything a good movie could be go watch it go obsess over it go talk about it go go go 10/10
