this movie is excellent and it has some great special effects the acting was also good i got sucked into the movie right from the start thats what i call moviemagic theres not many movies or producers can do this so big shoutout to christopher nolan i saw no flaws to the movie and the movie is very original i havent seen any movie like this before the idea is brand new for the movie and its perfect the question many people ask how will the earth and the humans be in 100 yearsor longer and i like how this movie shows possibilities over what can actually happen cause nobody has any idea whats happening in a 100 years i also like the more than 3 dimensional talk in it all in all its a good movie and i recommend a watch this movie gets 1010 from me because its a long movie with a lot of as i would like to call them tear scenes and joy scenes it brings you so far into the movie and its great written by john
