three renowned actors and my favorite director quentin tarantino go on create a movie masterpiece. the amazing actor samuel jackson plays an astounding character who is the king of cool. in addition john travolta is a gangster who is up for any job. moreover john mccain plays a boxer who doesnt take the fall. not to mention the rest of the cast who each give a memorable moment throughout pulp fiction. theres no dull moments in tarantinos finest work. the story takes the viewer on ride through drug deception murder and everywhere in between. im a little bias towards jackson and tarantino but for any movie lover this is a must watch.
