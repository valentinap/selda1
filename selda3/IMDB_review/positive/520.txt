the best batman that there ever will be the joker was amazing rip heath and the acting was on point i love this movie it is a great movie sure some parts made you feel scared of the joker and all but none the less this movie is so good start to end if you have not seen it then go do so you will enjoy it. do not read any further if you have not seen it i am going to write spoilers exit now i like the part where the joker hits batmans vehicle with a rocket and then it turns into a bike and the computer says goodbye that was so epic and not just that but the part where the joker says how bout alive is so well acted this movie is great in all and shows how the joker can go against batman because he is smart and half the time he has chances to kill him but the joker tricks and stuff
