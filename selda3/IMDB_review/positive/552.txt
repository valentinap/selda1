since the 90s came to a close ive been considering what the best films of the last decade were. the more i think about it the more i become convinced that pulp fiction will be seen as a milestone in american filmmaking. for one it is simply an incredible film in its own right. wonderfully drawn characters an incredibly compelling non-linear storyline and dialogue that shaped popular culture. from a historical perspective however it also represents a lot. it represents the emergence of independent films. before pulp fiction independent films were a rarity for the academy awards and now at least one best picture slot is guaranteed for them. it also virtually created the careers of john travolta now one of the top box office draws sam jackson and quentin tarantino. but most importantly it raised the bar in so many ways. the way it told the story that gags it used to get laughs and thrills at the same time and every other element of the film are now the standard that every other movie should be held to. an incredible film and an incredibly important one as well.  the characters the dialogue the music the colors the crazy plot. i wish tarantinos follow-up to pulp fiction had also been an ensemble piece but my guess is that he wanted to avoid being pegged as a certain kind of storyteller. in my book hes only one kind of storyteller: a great one. outside of short cuts this is the best film ive ever seen. 10 stars.
