yes stephen king writes drama. he also wrote stand by me the green mile and dolores claiborne. he has definitely been typed as a horror writer when he is an amazing tearjerker. this film is amazing. words cannot describe just how amazing this film truly is. i thought that i would not like this film as it looked like a bad sports movie. but when my science teacher told me i should see it because its a movie where you just go wow. i did and i was literally in tears by the end. not in tears of sadness but tears of joy. because the film was simply so beautiful. not very many films have made me cry. of course i cried at the endings of marley and me and toy story 3. but there are only 3 films ive ever cried at. some people say citizen kane or the godfather are the best movies ever. false. they are overrated. this film is a diamond in the rough. most people are stubborn and wont even take this gem into consideration. it truly is the best movie ever. the music the direction the cast. i wont give anything away you need to see the film to appreciate its true beauty but i will say that the music in this film puts john williams to shame and the movie reminds us that even in the most bleak of situations life can still be great. it is a great movie because it reminds us that hope is something that nothing can quench.
