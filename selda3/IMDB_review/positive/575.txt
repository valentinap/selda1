return of the king is one of those rare movies that i have so much trouble coming up with a decent review because im absolutely speechless. return of the king is also one of the rare films that actually surpass the hype. i have rarely been so emotionally exhausted in my life time. its a known fact that i dislike fellowship but adored two towers so i had high hopes for this one. return of the king has so much action going on its honestly hard to keep up. there is something going on at every turn with unbearable suspense. all the characters are even better this time around especially frodo. i was amazed at some of the selfishness he had this time around instead of the goody two shoes routine he usually did it made for some really gripping suspense. the performances are absolutely incredible for the most part everybody has truly grown up. i avoided the lord of the ring series for so many years because of the constant over hype people gave the series. well its nice to be proved wrong once in a while and return of the king especially shut me up but quick. bottom line. return of the king is a masterpiece plain and simple. its one of the best movies in the history of cinema and i thank peter jackson for giving me 3 or so hours of wonderful cinema. the two towers is a masterpiece itself but it does not compare to the brilliance of this one. even if you arent a fan of the genre this is still an absolute must watch. 10/10
