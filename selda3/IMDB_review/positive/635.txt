probably yes acting was good plot brilliant i mean stephen king wrote the book but it cant match the film. when i sow this movie i thought thats it this is it best movie ever. sure you can find people who didnt like it and when i ask why and try to guess what then happened they just confused themselves they can say reason why they dont like this movie... when i try to read comments with 1/10 star i cant find comment with good reasons that could make me realize that this movie is a bad movie if there is no reason then this means that its the best movie ever madethe only reason people are giving 1 star is that they dont like ratio 92 they want to do more effect by pull this high ratio down i really hate them : sorry for my bad english language i live in europe my english teacher is big cow with no knowledge...
