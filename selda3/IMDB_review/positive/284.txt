this is one of the movies of all time. theres action beyond belief and humor that breaks down the tension that really works. there also enough emotion to round out the experience. the joker is one of the best characters of all time. hes truly amazing. r.i.p mr. heath ledger. christian bale is of course one of the best actors ever. its truly a gift to watch them on screen. see this movie it will make you a better person. the ending is perfect and amazing. every time i watch it pick up something new. there was a lot of effort put into this. better than batman begins but not as good as inception. its actually surprisingly under rated.
