this movie has stuck with me since i saw it opening weekend as im sure it will for many of its viewers david fincher is someone ive come to admire as a filmmaker with his movies like se7en and social network so i obviously was interested in seeing this especially after watching the first trailer fincher and his marketing campaign made a smart move in not showing any big plot points in the trailers yet managed to keep you intrigued not something you see a lot of these days in movie trailers since this is a spoiler free review i wont go into too much of the details but this is probably the best performance ive seen from rosamund pike and the same for ben affleck i first noticed pike in movies like jack reacher and the worlds end and now i have a lot more respect for her as an actress ben affleck ive always liked as an actor before even in his directorial efforts and this id say is one of his best performances tyler perry who ive felt indifferent towards really impressed me here as the lawyer who helps ben afflecks character face the accusations against him neil patrick harris on the other hand made me feel uncomfortable in the wrong way nothing against the guy though but i dont think he was the right choice for the character he played gone girl does an excellent job of showing you how a persons life can crumble to the ground based on a few lies the media throws around just to bump up the viewership ratings and how a lot of us tend to believe everything that comes out a reporters mouth without considering that theyre might be more underneath the surface than what theyre showing you it also stands as a harsh and cynical commentary on marriage and how it falls apart based on how you treat your spouse and without giving anything away the marriage portrayal in this film makes me never want to get married or have a relationship put this in the hands of a lesser filmmaker gone girl wouldnt be getting the response its gotten its pretty clear that fincher is sitting behind the camera with his bleak tone dark color palette and how pessimistic everyone feels about life in general combine finchers direction with the screenplay by gillian flynn the author of the book of the same name there are so many twists and turns that suck you right in trying to figure out what happens next and has one of the most shocking scenes thatll blow your mind gone girl is a film that people will remember for a long time myself included and im willing to call it one of the best of 2014 i look forward to whatever david fincher does in the future
