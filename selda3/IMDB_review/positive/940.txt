id give this movie an 11 if it were possible. the lord of the rings: the return of the king lives up to its extremely long title. its a long movie. once youve seen the extended edition theres no going back. many key scenes were cut from the film. even today the special effect hold up better than many halfassed films on the market. epic is the one word to define this franchise. for long i have debated whether the second or the third film is the best. i cant decide. the music is beyond words. howard shore has crafted one of the best original s ever up there next to star wars. the lord of the rings shows hollywood how battle scenes are done. if youve never seen this die in a hole. long live the king.
