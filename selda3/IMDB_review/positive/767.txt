lord of the rings the return of the king is arguably the best movie in the history of movies. it is almost perfect if not perfect. peter jackson will go down as one of the greatest producer/director of all time. so many times we see great books series butchered on the big screen but not this time. this is 2nd best movie series of all time the only reason its not first is because star wars wasnt a book before the movies which made it a little harder to make. but if you are just looking at how well each movie was it is the best series of all time. im not gonna go into much detail because i feel like a review on here should just let the person that is reading it know if the movie is good or not. if you have seen the first 2 than get ready to be blown away. finally you get to see what happens to the ring and all the characters responsible for getting the ring to the place they can destroy it. will they get there if they do will they lose anybody else what happens trust me watch this movie along with all of your questions being answered you will also witness one of the greatest movies ever if not the greatest.
