on lord of the rings in general: this is how film making should be done this beautifully woven piece of cinema deserves all the praise and attention it gets it is truly a labour of love and care the tremendous amount of effort put into these films makes it a must see for anyone wanting to see how a big budget fantasy blockbuster should be made theres nothing bad about this film and if there is then people would be looking for things that are bad and thats just knit picking. everything from the writing casting acting production design art cinematography lighting music sound everything is spot on with this these films. on this film in particular: the best of the three thats right this is the first time i have watched a trilogy/ sequel and can put my hand on my heart and say that these films get better as they go along mainly because it reaches the ultimate climax it possibly can without losing any momentum and steam from the first films and has the best pay off you could ask for changes have been made from the books of course but every change jackson has made from tolkiens novels is completely justified for its use in a cinematic context i honestly cried at the end of this film and thats not an easy task for me to get me as invested in this world and its characters as jacksons trilogy has well lets just say it takes a lot only pixar has achieved the same with me and ill be lucky if any other film is capable of making me do so again. what is there more to say a beautifully made film with a wonderfully dramatic climax you really do get the feeling of being on a journey with these films you feel enticed with the characters as they embark on it and for a 3 hour film to do so without losing any momentum as with all three of them well thats an achievement in itself. it honestly deserved every award it got and then some.
