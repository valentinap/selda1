this doesnt bode well for my reading career gone girl is spectacular a strong contender for this years best picture i couldnt recommend it more highly reading the book isnt necessary the differences between the textual and visual are minimal reconsider the commitment lingering on your bookshelf this is one flick you wont want to miss if youve got a better half bring him or her along both men and women will thoroughly enjoy its long 145 minutes total but should hold your interest throughout the screenplay for gg is by gillian flynn the same woman who penned the novel if gone girl offers any inclination toward the quality of gfs alternative texts lets hope sharp objects and dark places are greenlit director david fincher doesnt have a distinct public persona like tarantino or an iconic physical appearance like scorceses that doesnt detract from his mastery of feature film direction iconic motion pictures like fight club se7en the social network and the girl with the dragon tattoo highlight his filmography if a storys a stairway gone girl is a multitiered double escalator its extremely well written and the tension is like radio static vibrating angrily amidst the coiling  the pacing is kinetic the story constantly switching gears the humor is occasional in a realistic fashion the selfawareness is pointedly subtle the characters are sympathetic and well rounded is it even necessary to mention neil patrick harriss performance? cant we just assume he was fantastic from now on? how about ben affleck everyones favorite punching bag? folks who doubted him should be flogged with a sofa cushion upon recommending gone girl a friends initial hesitation hinges on afflecks involvement first of all thats like saying youre missing the nsync concert because you dont like jts pipes benny was never bad at acting by any stretch of the imagination folks cite 2003s gigli and daredevil as fleck daddys downfall i cant speak to the former but a final thought on the latter at fourteen years old a group of friends and i thoroughly enjoyed daredevil in the theater plus it gave us a walk in the shoes of a blind person whether we appreciated it or not we were educated on a lifestyle none of us understood i can still cite multiple scenes in detail and i havent seen daredevil since that initial viewing my basic point is dont skip gone girl because of a strong opposition to afflecks acting ability rosamund pike is lightsout shes a semiunknown but a look at her filmography proves she deserves more notoriety ive a feeling well be seeing more of her in the future the remainder of the cast is just as good but too much detail may trigger a spoiler so ill leave it at that the warm weather left with the hummingbirds but at least there are solid flicks repopulating theaters
