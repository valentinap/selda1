this is on of my favorite movies of all times not to mention that quentin tarantino is probable one of my favorite directors on top of it but this movie is just one more prime example of why that is the performances of john travolta and samuel l jackson are riveting to watch and leave the viewer wanting more let us not forget the cameo performance either wonderful job to quentin for pulling of yet another stunning performance on the big screen the screen write is unprecedented to anything that has been released until now and has set the bar for future films to come if you are looking for a film of the decade you have found it this is definitely a film to last through the times
