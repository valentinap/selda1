what to say about the shawshank redemption i shouldnt really have to say anything because when most people hear about it they already have a pretty good idea of how incredible it is. this movie is freakin immaculate. darabont and co. have created not only the most inspiring film in ages but one of the most emotionally significant films to date. the movie teaches things to us that we need to know - messages on hope perseverance and friendship - and it does it with marvelous eloquency. all in all the shawshank redemption remains one of the most spectacular films i have ever seen - a master piece of art. perfect.  the characters the dialogue the music the colors the crazy plot. i wish tarantinos follow-up to pulp fiction had also been an ensemble piece but my guess is that he wanted to avoid being pegged as a certain kind of storyteller. in my book hes only one kind of storyteller: a great one. outside of short cuts this is the best film ive ever seen. 10 stars.
