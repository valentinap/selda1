the dark knight tops batman begins enormously. the line-up feels so different but only a small part of the cast is new. if you thought the first was good then this is the ultimate superhero film. the fact is it doesnt even have the feel of a superhero flick. yes you have the hero going around in a costume complete with a mask and cape and yes you have the villain disguised by something and wearing an iconic costume but if you actually look closer youll see the hero is a vigilante and youll see that his suit is very lethal and isnt a red and blue spandex outfit. and look closer at the villain and youll see he is absolutely crazy and insane but is also very very clever. the star of the film however isnt bats. its heath ledger as the joker. his death a few months after the release of the film was tragic so he left the world with one of the greatest characters of 21st century cinema. he is the glue of the film. the storyline is very good without being too serious. a bit of humour is injected but at the right dose. see this film and you will be amazed.
