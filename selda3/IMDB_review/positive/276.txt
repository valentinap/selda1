this is the batman movie i waited my entire life to see adam west the animated series and maybe michael keatons batman were decent but this film is on another level of awesome - and i mean it when i ask why it took so long for someone to do the batman franchise a solid favor. the characters portrayed by christian bale michael caine heath ledger gary oldman aaron eckhart maggie gyllenhaal morgan freeman and the music of hans zimmer really come together for swell time for a batman fan. another aspect i enjoy is the city-scape of chicago throughout the film. as a person from the midwest that kind of sweetens the deal.
