im not going to give any clues to the plot this film needs to be seen without knowing the end its very rare that the entire audience remains silent and seated when the lights go up brilliantly acted  ben afleck and rosamund pike were superb they played 2 very complex characters incredibly well i found it very hard to feel biased towards either of the main characters which i think was intended the film is very pared down in how it was shot which enabled the viewer to completely concentrate on the characters there were admittedly some parts which were less believable but they didnt take away from the overall enjoyment i need to see this again and again
