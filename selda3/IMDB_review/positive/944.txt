i wont possibly say anything new about this movie as its very professional certainly best movie of the year etc. but i want something to add - its sure one of the best movies ever made because of love of all team to tokeins book and material. its something you cant describe it because effects for example - yeah theyre great but you have seen them before. but how they are done how is acting is done soundtrack music everything - it shows that many for them - for actors artists for all team - it was magnum opus. work of life. made with love. best movie ever made in fantasy genre - and best movie of the year. oh and certainly the best triology ever made period.
