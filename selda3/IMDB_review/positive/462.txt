the first time i saw this movie was at a friends house i was only 11 at the time and i never really understood the real content of the movie but as i grew older and matured i watched it over and over again and now that i know what it is all about i can appreciate it a little more the movie became my life i would watch it almost everyday and never get sick of it i would show it to my friends and anyone else who was interested in watching it i dont know why it took me like it did but there was just something about it a film filled with great one liners and sayings that would make you look at the world of crime a lot more differently very offensive in more ways than one but if you can manage to look past the endless use of four letter words than you will probably like it if you havent seen pulp fiction than see it because you will miss the number one movie of all time
