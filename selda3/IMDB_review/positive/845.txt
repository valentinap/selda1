it is a movie made by a passionate film maker whose passion could be sensed in every set pieces and story elements .i happened to be very fortunate to get to watch it on its opening day 18 july 2008.and whatever ill assumption i made before entering the theater was completely vanished and i was speechless from its glittering imax footage action chase sequences to human emotions  everything is top notch i hardly believe ever there could be any film made with such perfection. this is not an ordinary movie which is made from computer graphics footage but believe me the stunts are for real and performed under strict guidance and a lot of practice and a lot of hard work . talking about the story  you could sense minute details of human emotions and it feels so refreshing that you would definitely be not forgetting at all .it seems pretty rare for some blockbuster movie to offer that thing. 10 on 10 from me worth more than 100 time watch
