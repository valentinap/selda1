this movie completes the series perfectly jackson is a genius. this movie is a must watch for any and every person no matter the race or gender. the only thing that is not good about this movie is that it has an end. its quite depressing. i have watched this movie at least once a new year and ever road trip. its very entertaining kills time inspiring awesome action scenes and the work on the uruk-hai and the other beasts is incredible. i only hope they make a remake that is even better than this movie if thats possible. all those haters who say that this movie is boring then they are missing the point and i would love to see what movies they find interesting. if there was a rating higher than 10 i would give it hands down. overall = amazing 10/10
