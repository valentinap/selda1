mission impossible tells the story of wrongly disavowed secret agent ethan hunt trying to prevent the theft of a list of all the secret agents in the world with the help of two other disavowed agents played by ving rhames and jean reno while all this is going on he must find the true mole in his agency that set him up mission impossible is the perfect film for anyone who enjoys a good spy movie the plot is quick and to the point it never lets up for a minute unfortunately when it comes to spy movies im left stumped with some of the details with mission impossible even though they talk about things that are hard for the layman to understand it can be easily figured out before the end of the film but who cares anyway? the action scenes are amazing particularly the famous sequence of ethan hunt dangling from a ceiling and catching a sweat droplet so it doesnt trigger the alarm since im young i never had the pleasure of watching the tv show but if it was anything like this movie im sure id truly enjoy it all the roles in the film are played very well i particularly enjoyed the fact that ethan hunts team is made up of well established actors such as jon voight emilio estevez and kristen scott thomas youre saying great cast this should be good then without a moments notice theyre all dead in the first 10 minutes mission impossible is an amazing thrill ride movie just what youd expect from the director of scarface and the untouchables 810
