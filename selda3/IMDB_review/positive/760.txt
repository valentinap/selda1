love them all. great movie and story action magic and drama. the cast as they have been all the way are excellent.i am a massive fan of the first two films - i loved them.frodo baggins and sam continue their quest to destroy the ring led by the untrustworthy gollum. meanwhile the rest of the fellowship prepare for another battle to hold a human city against an onslaught of orc.peter jackson has done it. he has created an all-encompassing epic saga of tolkiens lord of the rings books and after coming away from the final chapter ive never seen a series like this. i must say that the lord of the rings is an amazingly powerful visual experience.as a film though this is amazing. a true lasting legacy in story telling and now cinema. bravo mr. jackson
