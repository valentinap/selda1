this is one of the best ive watched the movie trilogy. i dont see tdk just as a superhero comic book movie because screenplay was written in a perfect way. created by nolan batsuit-mobile perfect design. the most beautiful thing in the film to return to the jokers and ledger as the joker was created to be such an amazing acting. when good and evil sits down to have a talk like an interrogation scene everyone in the audience shuts up and listens to what they have to say. thats i think this movie is great. i just did not like the actor who portray the character of rachel dawes. other than that nolan and his team did a great job. they can make 100 movies but we will feel its something missing perfect acting one of the best actors of all time nobody can be better than ledger as the joker.
