the best movie ever made period. i wont go on a very long and detailed review on the storywhich is magnificent and perfecti just want to say that this movie is a pure piece of art. the acting was perfect im really disappointed that the actors didnt have enough recognition for their performances actually the overall movie was underestimate by the oscars especially.this movie shows why cinema is an art powerful and heart full art. see this movie youll now what im talking about. i really tried to notice some gripes or problems but i cant. this movie is touching sad beautiful powerful and perfect. by the way f**k the academy awards for dumping this movie and do for forrest gump for the trophiesbut its just trophies... still a shame that they decided that. 11 out of ten totally deserves it.
