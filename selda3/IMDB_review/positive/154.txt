today i had the pleasure of experiencing richard linklaters pet project boyhood this is easily the greatest cinematic experience ive had in a long time considering linklater is one of my favorite working directors i am happy to say that high expectations were surpassed this is his best work to date the concept of filming for 12 years couldve easily come off as a gimmick but thankfully linklater who is one of the least selfindulgent and relaxed directors out there uses this ambition with natural depth and substance the 12 year deal is icing on the cake this is top notch filmmaking on a technical and emotional level one of the best traits about linklater is that he never overplays tearjerking situations or gets unrealistically dramatic he really understands the human soul its an epic yet charming honest and down to earth film i feel like just about anybody could resonate with it in some way i can easily see this going down as a universally loved american classic right next to films like 12 angry men pulp fiction and one flew over the cuckoos nest i strongly recommend it to everybody its truly a film that deserves to be seen i cant thank everyone involved with making this masterwork enough for being so patient i think it dethrones there will be blood as my favorite film of the 21st century thus far go see it
