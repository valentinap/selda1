one of the best movies that i have ever seen.it truly transcends time and is an epic in all proportions.people just dont make movies like this anymore and this is one of my favorite movies of all time. the movie is about andy dufranea banker who has been wrongfully acquitted of killing his wife in cold blood and send to shaw shank prison.the movie shows the various hardships faced by andy and how he does not give up hope and carries on with patience and finally becomes free. the climax is absolutely spellbinding and will leave you aghast.it is a truly great movie and i was aghast at finding out that this movie was a failure in the box office.but now almost everyone recognizes this movie for what it truly is - a masterpiece of storytelling.
