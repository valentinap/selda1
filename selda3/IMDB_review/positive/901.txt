im not comic book fanatic dont read them at all. not even real batman fan... but still i can surely say this is the best movie i ever saw. the plot acting effects story soundtrack... everything is just perfect. the way you can make such non-serious stuff like comic book character in to really serious movie is simply the work of art which this movie really is. when i see better movie then this ill let everybody know about it. actors are all great for the roll. so sad about ledger. even tho hes not with us anymore after watching this movie i consider him the best actor of our time. hell the best actor of all times by my opinion. this role simply made him that.
