this trilogy is the best ever. i love it  every time i watch those movies i realize that ill never be bored to watch them again. every thing is awesome from the story - till the screenplaypicturemakeupfashion design and the exceptional actors that make those movies a cinematic masterpiece and now after 10 years remains just as good from my point of view i think viggo mortensen would have deserved an oscar  best actor  for his role as aragorn  it fits him like a glove . congratulations to peter jackson and his entire team for his achievement and i look forward to see the movie  the hobitt
