i wont put any spoilers in this review  but i think everyone with a brain has already seen this or at least should want to see this movie because it is one of the greats of all time. i do think that christian bale did do an excellent job playing my favorite super hero  batman but this obviously isnt the reason this movie is on imdbs top 100 . heath ledger has one of the most spectacular acting performances ive seen in my life  i am 16 plus the plot line is amazing and well written. i typed this review mostly because i was bored but also to express my love for this movie. i have the movie at home but if it comes on tv i dont even think about passing it by. this is a movie for the history books
