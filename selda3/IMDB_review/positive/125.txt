weary beyond words hobbit companions frodo and sam continue their journey to destroy the one ring with the sinister gollum still their guide. the film opens interestingly with gollums origin story capturing his descent into depravity and madness finding the ring in much the same manner in which he lost it. the ring has the power to affect its bearer and not for good. with the battle of helms deep over and sarumans power gone the attention focuses on the capital of gondor minas tirith. there the race of men must make a last stand before the growing might of an unseen enemy while those visible are more of a threat than ever. the return of the king in its way is as much aragorns story as it is frodos
