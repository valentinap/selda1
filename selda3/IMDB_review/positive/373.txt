the thing really blew my mind about this movie was how the 3 dimensional 4 dimensional 5 dimensional spaces met at specific time when i heard about those dimensional spaces at first time i couldnt even imagine what it looks like but christopher nolan helped me out even though its just an one side of fiction to see i found so many knowledge of physics on this movie i was wondering if there is any other living earth or something? the answer is still not sure we dont know how 4 or 5 dimensional spaces work unless we go through in also the time difference really does make sense to me maybe someone in the other galaxy comes to us that person or something may just spend 10 minutes to get here and we may just face hundreds of year wow its truly blowing my mind
