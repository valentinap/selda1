kingsman the secret service is anything but an average action film or average spy film its much more the film genuinely blew my mind because of its take on modern day action spy films the comedy tint was absolutely brilliant  if there werent as many funny scenes it still would have been good but just not as good as it was i loved it taron egerton is great in the film as the main protagonist  eggsy the film revolves around the young man who trains to become the next kingsman colin firth was the most standout character alongside taron egerton colin firth was incredible in this film  sheer fantastic acting also its good knowing that we had so many great costars in the film the likes of samuel l jackson mark strong mark hamill and michael caine woah what a fantastic cast i enjoyed everyones role but my favourite in particular was probably colin firth as galahad samuel l jackson was funny in the movie and played a rather unusual yet interesting and good villain valentine i seemingly enjoyed every single thing about the movie  the opening the soundtrack the acting the visuals the comedy the action the little scenes of romance  the whole film was outstanding and so unique i say unique as in its take is so completely different from other generic action films or the simple spy film you get now and again and yes i liked this movie better than any james bond filmwith maybe the exception of moonraker and a few others nonetheless kingsman is an unexpected comedy joyride that explores inner levels of action adventure comedy and more i hope you go and see the movie  i hope you enjoy it simply inexplicably good
