stupid people will enjoy this movie but will say its really not all that great. smart people will say this movie was beautifully done and almost perfect. yes the ending was long but necessary. just think of how many characters were built up throughout the three movies. they all deserve an ending. try to think of the movie as 3 hours long and think of the ending as like the clips they show during the credits or an extra feature or something like that. somethings i would have liked to see different or removed: { the ending was too perfect. there should have been more tragedy. however you have to remember that peter jackson had no control over this. the book was already written a long time ago. the scene with legolas jumping on that elephant thing should have been removed or somehow reshot to make it seem less crazy. i know elfs are strong and more agile but it was still a little crazy. maybe some plot changes but the book was written a long time ago so i cannot dis the movie for those. thats about it i think. } watch it more than once...read the books if you have the time...and try to understand. great overall. peace. remy.  i mean who else could have played jules except samuel l. in conclusion see pulp fiction it will be like no other movie youve ever seen if you are worried about the language it fits in with the movie so when you think about it its not really that bad.
