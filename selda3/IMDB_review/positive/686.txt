one action scene after another and action is putting it lightly.you will sit on the front of your seat the entire movie. when you think you can sit back for a breather bam another action scene even bigger than the one before it. after this movie is over is the only time you will be able to sit back and relax. the faint of heart should not watch this one. nolan has made an enormously profitable smash with the batman franchise but at the risk of sounding priggish i cant help thinking it may be a bit of a career blind-alley for the talented director who gave us brilliant and disquieting movies like following 1998 and memento 2000 whose inventions still linger in the mind. the dark knights massive box-office success has surely given nolan the means to write his own cheque and in addition something sweeter still - clout. i hope that he will use it to cultivate movies that are smaller and more manoeuvrable than that great armoured batmobile.
