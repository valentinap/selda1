the lord of the rings the return of the king is an outstanding movie full of everything you could ever ask to be in a movie. there is romance between sam and rosie and aragorn and arwen who almost could not be together because of the war and faramir and eowyn. there is loads of comedy specifically speaking of merry and pippin but also between gimli and legolas when in the fight scenes. my favorite quote of gimlis is always: certainty of death small chance of success what are we waiting for i can not help but include a small giggle no matter what mood i am in. another scene is when legolas just takes on the giant elephaunt with many men in his way and gimli still manages to keep that as one: that still only counts as one this movie is of course action packed. thousands of blood-thirsty orcs completely built for killing march to the gates of minas tirith. after a few blows from the gondor catapults throwing chunks of the city the massive army breaks into the city destroying everything in their path. just as all hope fails aragorn gimli and legolas come to the rescue. of course they couldnt do it alone the three heroes come to the rescue with a massive army behind them. what kind of army you may ask a dead army. the deadly army of the dead joined forces with aragorn to assure their own freedom. the true meaning of the movie however is friendship. in the darkest times of middle earth 2 hobbits had what everyone in the world could have. each other or their own friendship. it seems as though the only hope in the world which they were lied with these two hobbits who berally knew how to wield a sword. carrying the one ring and each other frodo baggins and sam gamgee finally save middle earth and rid the world of its evil inhabitants just by keeping hope in front of them and holding on to each other. basically their faith in each other and their friendship saved all of middle earth. i hope that you enjoy this movie as much as i did.
