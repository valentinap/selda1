the return of the king is my favorite movie. it concludes a marvelous trilogy directed by the genie peter jackson  this last opus has absolutely everything a spectator can dream of: incredible special effects that even in 50 years wont seem outdated actors that believe in the story they are telling us if you check the dvds bonus youll see how all actors were deeply attached to their characters music that will lift you up to the clouds a story certainly inspired by tolkiens books but still really catchy but in another hand jackson edited the books to make movies even more interesting and i could go on and on and on ... congratulations to all the ones that have contributed to the making of this film
