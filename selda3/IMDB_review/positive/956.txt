i was still in high-school and first lotr:fotr came out. i watched posters all over the place on the bus stop in subways and everywhere. i went to watch a movie and saw the trailer. it has very ancient type look and has no interesting feelings. the only part that looked very surprising was the end of the trailers with humongous army. then one day i was surfing the web and hit the download link on kazza if people may know what kazza was at that time. after few hour the download was complete. so i sat on the chair in front of the 15 inch computer screen with video size of iphone screen 600*400. after more than three hours my mind was lost in that small screen. i could not believe what i saw. i was a spectacle of life. a sheer journey to the land of fantasy warriors and elves  i kind of fell in love with arwen at that time. then i realized that some how the end was not complete. it stuck in my mind for few days then started surfing the web again. eventually i found out that it was the first part of the trilogy. and after 10 years its is still the best movie ever made. the movie rewrote the scale ad scope of making movies. i hope the hobbit turns out to be of similar calibre.
