yeah must admit. this is my fav movie of all times. if tarantinos reservoir dogs was amazingly shocking this time is maturely shocking. it is just that way tarantino drives the audience that leaves me thinking. samuel l. jackson john travolta and uma thurman just rule. the scene where the last two dance at the jack rabitt slim is one of the most simple and yet beautiful dance scenes in time. so does the restaurant scene with honey bunny and pumpkin...its a total standout its that way that samuel jackson treats the situation...really a blow-out a must see. all over the movie the audience keep thinking on what if... what if i shoot right here right now yeah what its just the way tarantino plays with the wild emotions hiding into ourselves...he just blows peoples minds with this movie tarantino has to be accepted as tha master he is both directing and writing.  and though i like reservoir dogs more pulp fiction is not too far away of being as great as that. and i must say too that pulp fiction should have won the oscar that year instead of forrest gump.
