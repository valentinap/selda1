my boyfriend and i got invited to a prescreening first time ever and we had no idea what kind of film this was going to be i knew the actor from the kings speech and my bf told me this was by the same director who had done x men first class which i think is the best but because of the main actor i thought this would be some british comedy i was not prepared for this hilarious crazy action film its really really funny and its very violent i dont know whether many women are going to like it i do but i prefer south park over sex and the city and i usually hate chick flicks it is a comedy but not what youd expect and despite this being not at all like xmen i absolutely loved the film and samuel jackson is in the film if you like spy movies and if youre not offended by gory violence and very dirty language go watch this film the last 30 minutes or so are like the craziest ive ever seen in an action film and i have seen a lot of action films believe me the storyline is a bit like men in black without aliens and the young actor who plays the rookie is perfect in this part the film might not be very realistic but i thought this was one of the best action comedies i have seen in a long time
