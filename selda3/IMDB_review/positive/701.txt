now here we are with the big one. the film that is often called the best film of the decade. the gigantic mass of epic known as the lord of the rings: return of the king. everyone looks at this film as the best. in fact not only the best but the best by far is what people consider this film to be. it was nominated for 11 oscars including best picture and won every oscar it was nominated for. it was a huge success and yes this film is fantastic. it is one of the biggest adventures i have ever seen. everything that was great in the first two are great here also. the writing visuals acting are all top notch stuff. so is it the best in the trilogy well i consider all 3 to stand together as one huge film experience. if any one of them didnt exist the others wouldnt be as good. all of them standing together give us a complete and epic adventure. 4 stars out of 4
