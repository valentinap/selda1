peter jacksons lord of the rings trilogy comes to its epic conclusion in fine style: frodo and sam enter mordor while the battle of the pelennor fields begins largely as a feint to draw saurons army away to allow the ringbearer clear passage to mount doom. following the ring meeting its fate all story lines are brought to their resolutions in a half hour or so of winding down. jacksons visualisation of what happens inside mount doom is faithful to and improves upon tolkiens source - once again tolkien threw away one of his set pieces in less than a page. the one false note is gollums final expression - i would have expected agony rather than blimey thats a bit of a surprise there are at least five separate end-pieces - the fellowship reunited aragorns coronation the return to the shire the grey havens and sams return home it is possible to argue at least a couple more. the film could have been ended on any of these and there are those who argue that it should have been. but although the film could have ended there the story could not and credit to jackson for adding a half hour capstone to a ten hour film in order to properly resolve all that should have been resolved. i feel this particularly strongly since this closing section contains two of my favourite moments. one is the moment in the tavern - the four hobbits traumatised by war sit together in silence in stark contrast to the trivial carousing in the opposite bookend tavern scene in fellowship. and the other is frodos final look back. if elijah wood never delivers another moment on screen as powerful as that one and im sure he will that is enough. a towering achievement in all respects.
