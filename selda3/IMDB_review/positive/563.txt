shawshank redemption at first wont strike you as a great moviewhen u look at the castexcept morgan and other things but believe me its the best the story and the cast simply overwhelms you its such a great film that one would want to watch it again and again. the movie gives a feel that not many movies can give. it gives you sense of contempt that you had taken the right choice in seeing this film. well it was released when i was very young i could find time to see it only now. and i still feel i should have seen this movie long before its worth every second guys dont miss it its the best  but the most important fact is that lotr is not only an adventure: it is a great lifes metaphor and the end of this trilogy complete the sense of life that tolkien want to tell us: never stop searching for new experience never think of having arrived there is always something you can discover and it can be both good and evil. the last image of the film when gandalf the elves and frodo are leaving the middle-earth is the perfect conclusion of the greatest and the most epic saga of all time.
