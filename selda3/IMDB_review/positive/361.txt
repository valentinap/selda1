there are only a few movies that one will see in their lifetime that affects the course of your life. i have loved the shawshank redemption since i first saw it but only recently had its powerful effect shown to me. in short order i lost my father to illness my wife to separation and my career to anger and dismay. lost in depression mired in pain and alone in a large house i watched it again. between brooks suffering reds hatred of hope and andys response to his final isolation i stopped feeling alone. it is simple...get busy living or get busy dying. this movie gave me the strength to start over. the movie is popular for many reasons but it has a healing power for people trapped in their own shawshank.
