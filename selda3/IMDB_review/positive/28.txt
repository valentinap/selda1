words cannot explain the thoughts i have on this movie unlike the new xmen i think the more you think about it the more you like it although both movies were equally good guardians has a good humor vibe throughout the movie with a compelling plot and an ultimately brilliant outcome of a movie i may even see it again i have read the comics before the movie was thought of and let me tell you it was very true to the characters and let me say i had doubts about vin diesels talent between groots small role in speech but now i dont think anybody else could have matched how well he performed marvel can surely be at the top of greatness at the moment with its movies however i highly doubt that and i cannot wait for the next installment of superhero action brought to us by marvel roll on josh brolin and his take on thanos
