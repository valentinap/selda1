when i saw pulp fiction the first time i knew instantly that i have to see it over and over again the cast directing story and everything matched completely in a way that i love them to match tarantino made an outstanding job in this film and i was very very disappointed when the movie did not receive oscar for best film or best direction this loss made me realize for sure that the best ones are not the ones to get the so called highest recognition but anyhow pulp fiction is and probably always will be the movie that i want to see over and over again and also the one that i want to remember for the rest of my life >
