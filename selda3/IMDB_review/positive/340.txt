this film along with all of the the lord of the rings trilogy are the most amazing films i have ever seen i have also read the book and the ending could have stuck to it more spoiler: saruman dies at bag end in the hands of grima wormtonguethe shire is burnt and turned bad because of them- a great scene but still entirely excellent. i especially love the fact that viggo mortensen aragorn sings and billy boyd peregrin/ pippin took... all the actors and actresses are terrific the film deserves the 11 oscars that it received. i am a peter jackson fan and tolkienite all the books are brilliant and the films match them... such a fan that i have the soundtracks i want to thank also howard shore the london philharmonic orchestra ben del maestro renee fleming sir james galaway and annie lennox for the soundtrack... and to enya sheila chandra elizabeth fraser and emiliana torrini for the fellowship of the ring and the two towers soundtrack. i cried....many a time... all i can say is watch it... see for yourself :
