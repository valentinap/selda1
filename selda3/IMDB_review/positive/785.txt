ive watched this film several times and i really enjoy it i think films wouldnt be the same nowadays without tarantino i fell in love with tarantino with this film and i started watching all of his works including the films that werent directed by him this is his best motion picture and its one of those films that you just cant miss like the godfather or irr’©versible or a clockwork orange or the shining you may say it sounds stupid but to me this film has the soul of the western ones you can see in it all the references of the best pictures ever made it has great violence the good one the one that tarantino talks about when he says that movies were made to violence and nothing else
