my overall review for the movie  it was amazing. its a masterpiece. i mean i have never watched any superhero movie this good. what an acting performance by heath this is the only villain which is more liked than the actual hero. and a whole lot of good direction by nolan. hattsoff to him.the story overall describes the fearthe pain and the agony that dark knight suffers. this movie is a must must must watch.n addition to new characters like harvey dent played superbly by aaron eckhart by the way all significant characters from nolans previous film batman begins return for this new adventure. police lieutenant jim gordon played by gary oldman bruce waynes faithful butler alfred played by michael caine waynes go-to guy for fancy gizmos lucius fox played by morgan freeman and assistant da and waynes love interest rachel dawes played this time by maggie gylenhaal are all back and have respectable roles to play here but the dark knight is ultimately about batman and the joker. its a much darker film than any of the previous batman movies and it goes into directions that few comic-book films have taken before. much of that edginess comes from the joker and his sinister plans. not merely content at killing his enemies the joker chooses to psychologically torment his rivals by forcing them to question what they stand for.
