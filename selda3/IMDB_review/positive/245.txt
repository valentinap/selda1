this movie defines excellence in the field of comic book heroes and in the field of cinema. its a crime that this film wasnt nominated for best picture because it clearly was the best film of the decade. no other comic book hero will ever surpass this film because you cant beat perfection and this movie is perfection. i can say that i have seen the dark knight at least twenty times and my life and yes at times it gets boring but i keep watching because i love watching perfect films. if i see this movie come on television i always record or watch it. i wont skip out on that. it will be hard to make another batman story with the fact that christopher nolan has changed comic book movies forever with this one film
