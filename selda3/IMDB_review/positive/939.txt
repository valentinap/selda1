id heard about this film a few years ago and id heard it was good. i was lied to. this film wasnt good it was outstanding i cant believe i never watched this sooner from the opening scenes where the mysterious andy dufresne is being dragged into hell to the credits as red runs across the beach to him this film was in a word perfect no holes to spot almost everything was completely accurate probably some of the best script ive ever heard and a brilliant story. normally if a film goes over two hours i start to get a little bored and i end up wanting the film to end but this was completely the opposite i never wanted this to end and the hefty 140 minutes get you wanting more and the story drew me in so much i felt as if i was there. normally with films adapted from stephen king books they dont do so well on the big screen but this has proved that wrong overall i like this film because its realistic it goes into great depth and the story is so gripping you cant take your eyes off the screen and this film will always be there at the top as one of my favourite films ever
