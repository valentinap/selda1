whenever this movie comes on i have to watch it. this movie is very compelling and if you have not seen it im not going say much to spoil it for you. this movie takes place over a few decades of wrongful imprisonment of a banker who is accused of killing his wife. the time spent in prison is sought with so many horrors as i saw it especially for a man who never should have been imprisoned. the end is great and after the movie is over they just leaving you hanging on a whats next like no other. i have seen many movies leaving you or trying to leave you hanging but every time i see the shawshank redemption i wonder what occurred after the beach.
