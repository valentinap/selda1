one of the films that you must watch in lifetime. a film about long-term imprisonment that takes its time to convey what the slow crawl of a lifers existence might feel like. thoroughly gripping and pretty refreshing. ten years ago the shawshank redemption was a low-key prison film that didnt recoup its costs. slowly it has become one of the most popular movies of all time - and for some it has even been life- changing. it is a strange comment to make about a film set inside a prison but the shawshank redemption creates a warm hold on our feelings because it makes us a member of a family. many movies offer us vicarious experiences and quick superficial emotions. shawshank slows down and looks. it uses the narrators calm observant voice to include us in the story of men who have formed a community behind bars. it is deeper than most films
