in 1995 when i was fourteen out of the blue i saw in a newspaper that one of my favorite stephen king stories rita hayworth and the shawshank redemption had finally made its way to the silver screen. it wasnt showing at the hoyts/greater union cinemas rather a local independent/art-house cinema. of course that didnt bother me so i went. over 2hours long shawshank swept you into another world. stephen kings short-novel was very faithfully adapted. three pieces of brilliance stood out then and still do today. 1 first the film was brilliantly paced never a dull moment. having read the short-novel before hand didnt diminish any expectations. 2 second a brilliant cast. sheer brilliance from morgan freeman and tim robbins as red and andy dufresne. very strong supporting cast in bob gunton - the cruel warden sam norton other inmates: gill bellows as young tommy williams james whitmore the elderly brooks brilliant expansion of character that short novel only dealt with in two paragraphs. yet the show was stolen by clancy brown. browns legendary performance as captain bryon hadley one guy you clearly didnt want on your case 3 finally what remains in my mind the most from reds last parole-hearing to the end of the film. words cant simply convey the emotions this was what i didnt except. it was so powerfully done. my favorite quote: andy dufresne: get busy living or get busy dying.  enough said.
