this film is brilliant just brilliant. i watched this film expecting just a normal movie but when it ended i knew it would stay with me forever. every decade has one or two groundbreaking movies the 70s had the godfather and apocalypse now the 80s had platoon and raging bull the 90s had the shawshank redemption and pulp fiction and the 2000s had gladiator and the lord of the rings. there were a lot of good films in the 90s and this is up there with the best . the story is about a man called andy dufresne tim robbins who is wrongly convicted and sent to the shawshank prison. when there he meets red morgan freeman and then the story takes off. the acting is incredible and freeman and robbins deliver the performances of their career the script is incredible another great collaboration between steven king and frank darabont and it didnt win one single oscar this could have been good enough for three oscars at the least true the competition forrest gump and pulp fiction were good films but the shawshank was certainly good enough to win a couple. so if you havent seen the shawshank redemption buy it rent it and watch one of the most powerful and moving films ever be prepared to be blown away.
