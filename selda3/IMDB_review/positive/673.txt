one of the best new movies to have come around in a long while its definitely my favorite angelina movie by far she was exceptional in her role she made me love maleficent before maleficent was just some character in an old disney princess movie that really made me feel nothing for her at all this film brings maleficent to wonderful life she is honestly now one of my most favorite characters of all time this is definitely not like any disney princess movie if thats what you may be thinking its dark and beautiful and if it wasnt blatant about being disney you might not even know this film is definitely worth a watch it has taken a place on my favorite movies list for sure
