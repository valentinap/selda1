on a winters weekend when i was six my family and i having not seen a lotr film before watched the trilogy. and yes it deserves a capital. then i watched it for the battles the epic battles. now i watch it for the story nostalgia and of course the battles. i have watched each of the trilogy many many times. ive watched them in the car on an old portable dvd player that only lasted two hours and ive watched them on each of the three tvs my family has owned in the last nine years. ive grown up with the films and the games of the films the top trumps and the knock-offs of the films. nothing can replicate the plot or the spectacle i know but something to remind me of them is enough. and i am therefore finally reading the books yes im looking forward to the hobbit trilogy note no capital not yet at least. but i am always looking back at lotr.
