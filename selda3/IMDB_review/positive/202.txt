this movie is so famous believable and intriging that many rumors are circulated about it as if it were more than just a movie which is basically all that it is pulp fiction is a perfect example of how effective a good film can be while becoming a part of american culture its one of those times when you want to seek the director and badger him with questions only to not recieve answers because shallowing a deep masterpiece would only take away the magic pulp fiction is not an exercize in creating thick plots but one in creating believable charasmatic characters all they do is talk simply because theyre cool funny charming fictional people whom we love to see talking the movies primary way of entertaining us is by showing us how each person talks uniquely and like every great film it relies heavily on performance its one of my top ten and i give it a ***10****
