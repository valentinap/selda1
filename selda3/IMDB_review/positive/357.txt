there arent many films that can capture you and absorb you for almost 3 hours boyhood did i went into it thinking it would be another inflated award nominated let down having heard about it for some time now and moving from excitingly wanting to see it to feeling as though the hype had taken over graciously i was wrong the characters and story whilst simple and quiet absorb you and lead you to invest in wanting to see how this normal life of a boy and family filmed for 13 years changes nothing happens? depends on the viewers perception of nothing and if its storytelling or spectacle you want i love both in films but would choose the storytelling characters and heart of boyhood over any recent films if not most films excellent
