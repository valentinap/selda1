this movie im not going to call this film the imdb #1 movie but i really cant deny that this is fantastic. the cast the  the writing and the power are all here in this film and filled with strength. its one of those movies that you will continue to think about even after the film is over. it is about a friendship a life an evil and a hope. a hope that is considered in many ways to be bridge to insanity inside the prison walls. we see these people as years of time goes by. we see friendships grow and topics change. it really puts you in the prison and makes you feel whats like to behind those bars. you feel the friendship the hope the darkness and the pure horror of it all. 4 stars out of 4
