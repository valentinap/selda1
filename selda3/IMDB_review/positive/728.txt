my favorite movie of all times. excellentbrilliantexquisite.... soooooo emotional and so epic at the same timethe best example is the scene when king theoden encourages his soldiersand tells themthat they have to fight because there are greater things at stakes than their lives. i cry every time. the battle for minas tirith is very dramaticmakes you sit at the edge of your seat all the time. the ending contains very tolkien-like feelinghappiness mixed with a bit of grief and loss. if there is anyone on this planet who havent seen it yetknowyou are very wrongthis movie is worth your timeand it will give you so much pleasure.
