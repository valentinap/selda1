when i first rented pulp fiction out of the local filmtown video store i didnt know what to think i just thought that three hours of talking who cares but when i saw the movie second timei was completely blown away bruce willis as bad as he wants to be gives everything he got while playing the role of butch he is frustrated angry scared and out of is mind at the same time well who wouldnt be if he had a mob like ving rhames tryin to catch him john travolta and samuel jackson is the most perfect on-screen duo ever seen travolta a gentleman hoodlum tries to talk sense to jackson who experienced a religious awakening during a normal payback assignment uma thurman plays her role like its in her blood she plays mia wallace a drug addict and mobs wife she kinda reminds me of courtney love it is amazing how quentin tarantino can make a conversation about european fast food restaurants sound interesting tarantino is genius i tell you genius a three-hour film full of dialogue sounds boring but this is anything but that damn i shouldnt have written this now i want to watch it again
