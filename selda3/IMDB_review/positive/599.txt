pulp fiction where do i even begin to review a film like pulp fiction let me just start out by saying that i have never seen another film like pulp fiction this was my first quentin tarantino film and in my opinion none of his other films have even come close to this masterpiece one of the greatest things about this film and also something that sets it apart from most any other movie is that it revolves around the dialogue the conversations between characters in pulp fiction are unlike any conversations between characters that i have ever seen in a film because they are absurdly realistic this film is the most quotable movie i have ever seen to the point where the last scene of the film i know almost every line usually if a film tries to revolve around the dialogue it ends up being really boring this is because not many directors can do dialogue the way that quentin tarantino does dialogue the acting in this movie is also incredible this is my favorite role that samuel l jackson has played jules winnfield and also my favorite role of john travoltas vincent vega as well as my favorite role of uma thurman mia wallace and tim roth ringo there is not one weak performance in pulp fiction tarantinos non-linear non-story based masterpiece is the most unique film that i have ever seen it is entirely left up to your own interpretation nothing in this film is explained for you you are free to think of it however you want and make up your own stories once you see the film you will no doubt be left with questions such as what is in the briefcase one of the longest standing questions asked of a film people try to come up with the answer but the truth is that there is no answer the answer is whatever you want it to be never before have i seen a film that leaves so much up to the viewers interpretation and does it so well if you do not see this movie you are missing out on one of the best movies ever made and possibly the most unique film that you will ever see this quentin tarantinos masterpiece by far pulp fiction obviously gets a 10 out of 10
