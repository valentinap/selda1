this isnt just a fancy superhero movie...its beyond that. it deserves every amount of praise lavished onto it. putting aside the plot and the taking the performances of everyone involved in the movie are beyond excellence. christopher nolan is as usual at his best. nolan strikes with his non- linear storytelling in his own style. we will be blown with his sublime work. this is definitely the sequel we deserved. christian bale and heath ledger were phenomenal. the joker has made evil look so good... this is the first film i know where the joker who plays a negative role had such a positive impact on the film.
