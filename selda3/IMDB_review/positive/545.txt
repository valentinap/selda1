sorry entire cast other than heath ledger. heath blew this character out of this role. they could have called this movie the joker. his role made me become a huge batman fan. i already collect movies but i went in to high gear for the different covers of the movie especially when he was on cover. i have a framed picture of him where he is standing in the street when he thinks he finally caught batman. the poster has his and christian bales facsimile autographs. im still searching for more different covers. jack nicholson is one of the greatest actors but sorry mr. jack nicholson heath made you look like a novice actor i highly recommend this movie. has a great story great acting great directing but out this world acting from heath ledger. he is a actor that will be missed
