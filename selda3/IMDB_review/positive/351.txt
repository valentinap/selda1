there is no other word to describe this film everything from the casting to the choice of music is perfect in my opinion there is humour violence shock it has everything a film needs and they are all portrayed in a sensational way for people who havent seen the film it is a collection of stories all jumbled out of chronological order and all are somehow intertwined the individual stories themselves are wonderful and i would watch them on their own the way that tarantino has put all the stories together so that we still arent sure how they all connect until right at the end is amazing the film somehow has a gritty reality to it even though some of the events that happen are ridiculous they are believable all the same the amazing thing is that tarantino always manages to produce incredible films this is imo the best film that he has made and probably ever made and for any fan or in fact anyone who has not seen this film yet go out and buy it now
