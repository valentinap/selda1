i saw this movie and i wanted to rush to imdb to write a review about how incredible this movie is but instead i decided to wait and let the movie sink in for a little while i have been thinking about this movie for two days pretty much the whole day not many movies do this to me then i saw the movie again and it was just as incredible as the first time i saw it i dont want to give too many details or even any on the story because you just have to see it for yourself ive read some of the negative reviews and those people mostly complain about the laws of physics being broken yes some of the things done in this movie are complete fiction and others are theoretically possible but the genre is called science fiction so distorting some truth is perfectly fine in my book
