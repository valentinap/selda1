one of the greatest movie ever made. the storyline the acting and of course the ending - all perfect.. definitely the strongest of the movies in the trilogy. the movie itself is breath-taking exciting incredibly emotional and tough in so many different levels. i get the same stunning feeling every time i watch it. christian bale & heath ledger really managed to pull it off #the scene when batman has to choose between saving rachel or harvey dent.. damn and how the joker manages to break even one of the very best. and then twists him leaving him suffering as a changed man making some really bad decisions. not to mention all the chaos he made in gotham.. until batman shows up attempting to clean up all the madness. i am still not 100% sure if joker actually won at the end or batman kinda succeed.. anyways this is a movie that will be watched in many many centuries. r.i.p heath ledger
