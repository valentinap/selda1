the dark knight is a rare example of a movie where *everything* is in place. christopher nolan doesnt cut corners. this movie easily surpasses even the highest expectations and i immensely enjoyed watching it. the plot was convincing and original. the script was smooth and clever. the dialogues were interesting and memorable. the camera work was top quality. there was absolutely no scene where i would think something like hey ive seen this before *and* the original was better or hmm this served no purpose. heath ledgers performance was outstanding. i mean others were great too christian bale gary oldman michael caine but... heath who portrayed the joker was just brilliant. unlike many other movie villains who are basically pitiful clowns his clown is a true villain. hes the guy you dont want to encounter even if youre a masked vigilante because the price is too great. the joker has no weaknesses and no inhibitions. like the devil himself hes smart charismatic dedicated scary and in his own sick and morbid way funny. worse yet he corrupts people he finds the seeds of evil in the darkest corners of their souls. the dark knight is a true masterpiece. even if you dont like batman movies in general chances are youll enjoy this one. 10/10
