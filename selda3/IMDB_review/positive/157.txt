to be honest i enjoy reading a good novel more than watching a film. you usually get far more character development than in a movie e.g. puzos the godfather. but not with shawshank. this is the closest thing film has to a perfect story. the characters pacing plot monologues and every other element contribute to an inspirational yarn with a fulfilling ending. brooks suicide is the only film scene that has ever moved me to tears and if you watch just one film in your life - let it be this. not a film which others have tried to mimic for a good box office e.g. lotr: the return of the king the godfather but an original stand-alone film that in my opinion will never be surpassed in quality
