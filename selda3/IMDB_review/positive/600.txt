pulp fiction turns a lot of people off at first with its violence and its nonlinear plot but on subsequent viewings the movie improves by leaps and bounds. every time you watch it you will catch more nuances you will recognize the skill of craftsmanship that went into making this film. im not even talking about tarantino even though i feel this is his best. watch how many details the actors put into their roles the small gestures and looks that make the dialogue sizzle. samuel jackson and uma thurman are obvious standouts and tim roth and harvey keitel are also quite good. christopher walken steals the show with the most memorable single-appearance role in recent history. so even if you didnt care for it the first time give it another try. and if you liked it the first time buy a copy and watch it until it wears out like mine just did
