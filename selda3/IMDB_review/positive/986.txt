i suppose that someone sometime may tell the story more accurately but i doubt very much that it will ever be told better. nothing could ever replace the books for pure escapism but peter jackson has managed to evoke both the feel and texture of tolkiens masterwork without pandering too much to clich’©d hollywood extravagance. the cast are superb if sir ian mckellen is remembered for nothing else other than gandalf i feel sure he would not complain the cinematography stunning and the pace even over the 8/9 hours for the whole trilogy is matchless. for those who have read the books as i have for many years i would suggest watching once to get all of the niggling storyline changes/omissions out of your system then just watch as a pure wonderous unadulterated piece of epic epic cinema. im sure i will love it forever.
