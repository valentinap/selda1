my ex-girlfriend refuses to watch this one and shell probably still live a fulfilled life but for those of us who can never regain our innocence you have to admit this is one hell of a movie some of the sharpest funniest dialogue ever written yes a bit contrived at times some times tarantino sounds like hes trying to sound like tarantino but still stunning the verbal sparring is every bit as exciting and violent as the blood and bullets and little bits of brain interesting postmodern take on spirituality camus wouldve been proud even if jules conversion was based on the possibly incorrect assumption that god had directly intervened in his life postmodernism says hey what they hell go for it its not any more or less true than anything else so more power to you praise be to god interesting tarantino is sometimes criticized for being too clever with his influences and allusions but i dont think thats true of pulp fiction yes we can see shades of kiss me deadly deliverance etc but i dont think they take over the movie also the music works in the movie but not in my opinion on the soundtrack cd tarantino was once asked if he had intentionally put songs like jungle boogie in with the intent to be campy but q said that basically he didnt care what was considered corny and what was considered art he just knew he liked it probably gives us a little insight into his view of movie making too
