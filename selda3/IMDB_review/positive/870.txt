in short this film is nothing short of amazing beautifully shot witty writing and with angelina jolies impeccable acting skills this film was always going to be a hit it is truly magical  everything you dreamed of once playing off with the fairies in the imaginary worldof childhood if your looking for a film that gives a sense of escapism this is it angelina is truly underrated whilst the makeup and costume add to the power of her character it is the true aura of herself that brings maleficent to life only she could give the character a true malevolence yet be heart breaking at the same time you really end up feeling for her and realise perhaps all is not always as it seems i would definitely recommend to anyone that is debating watching this film  who knows you may just find your wings
