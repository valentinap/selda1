pulp fiction begins with a pitch and ends with a homerun the movie from start to finish is one great roller coaster ride it will make you laugh at most with the close to real life dialogue the chemistry between the characters in the movie especially john travolta and samuel jackson john travolta and uma thurman tim roth and amanda plummer and bruce willis and maria de medeiros will keep you highly entertained at the end of the movie you will only wish it never ended the quirky dialogue combined with the fast paced violence is just as good as mixing gin with tonic quentin tarantinos style has influenced a legion of film directors throughout the nineties including bryan singer james mangold and paul thomas anderson he pretty much shaped the decade of movies with pulp fiction reservoir dogs true romance and jackie brown and popularized independant movies all around pulp fiction is the best movie i have ever seen watching this movie alone is what a real movie-watching experience is all about i give it a solid 10 and no competition whatsoever by any other movie watch it yourself and you will know what i mean
