this is the best of the dark knight trilogy in my opinion. heath ledger is fantastic as the joker also i feel he kind of gets put in the back burner but aaron eckharts harvey dent/ two face is also fantastic and the special effects on his face are incredible. bale will always be my favourite batman and this story is brilliant especially the tension between the two boats at the end. kind of annoying they changed the actor of the rachel character only to have her go and get killed but thats only one small gripe in an otherwise perfect film. id also like to mention the fantastic opening sequence in the bank that has to be one of my favourite scenes in any film hopefully the second man of steel film will be as fantastic as this second dark knight movie
