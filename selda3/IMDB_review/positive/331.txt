this film is just too good for words to describe go and see this spectacle it will blow anyone away im not the biggest fan of fantasy adventures but this has blown me away and what an ending for the the brilliant trilogy. return of the king is better than the other two lotr films in my opinion but all three films are a joy to watch over and over again cant praise peter jackson enough as i said earlier on he created a peace of film making which is too good for words to describe and everyone should go witness this spectacle
