there are no flaws in tdk. the acting the story the characters everything was absolutely amazing. the highlight of this movie is obviously heath ledger. his brutal haunting and somehow charming performance perfected this movie. christian bale did great as bruce wayne/batman. though the character didnt emote as much as i thought he shouldve but its not cbs fault its the writers. aaron eckhart did great in the transformation of the hero to the villain great great performance and cool effects on his face. all in all its a pretty amazing movie and i recommend it to anyone and everyone  you start slowly after a while you get attached by the time you reach the middle of the movie you simply totally forget about anything outside the screen and feel a mixed stream of emotions going through you head before anything else then comes a last 20 minutes of heart storming that is surely enough to raise the adrenaline to extreme levels even in diabetics i felt warm strong happy and all other emotions one can think of i felt i was the one who won who got out of prison i was simply fully satisfied. this movie must be used as an anti-depression by therapists this movie proves that oscars are either money bought gifts or that who ever in charge of them are so smart that they couldnt give any oscar to the shawshank redemption knowing that the movie is on different - much higher- rating scale than the oscars.. its simply over qualified
