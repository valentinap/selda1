the best movie i have ever watched . heath ledger was the master piece. the entry of the of joker was brilliant there are some really exhilarating set-pieces especially the one that kick-starts the proceedings: nolan starts off with a high-tension high-anxiety bank raid carried out by a dodgy crew all in joker masks all whispering among themselves about the crazy guy in clown makeup who hired them to do the job. why isnt he there personally wait - is he there personally summary : batman christian bale has been able to keep a tight lid on crime in gotham city. but when a vile young criminal calling himself the joker heath ledger suddenly throws the town into chaos the caped crusader begins to tread a fine line between heroism and vigilantism . the plot thrown by the criminal joker to test the sanity of batman and the city of gotham .
