pulp fiction is hands-down one of the greatest movies ever made. the cinematography is excellent the characters deep the tale supension and the plot well-written. quentin tarantino has outdone all previous efforts with his exceptioal tale of two hitmen a boxer a suitcase and the wife of a mob leader. all in all a terrific film that everyone should own and watch multiple times. i tell ya there is so much to miss on the first viewing multiple viewings are mandatory
