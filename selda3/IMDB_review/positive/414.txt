the perfect ending of the best epic movie in the history. do not try to compare the first or the second movie with this you must see it as a 10 hours movie. sorry there is no lord of the rings next year...damm  the film is just a big crazy amusement park. most important to me though and im sure many others would have to be the storys structure. have you ever seen a chronological timeline of the film its crazy. its like when the film is in the correct order it doesnt make sense anymore. it wouldnt fit the film because its too much fun for an a to b. the way quentin tarantino weaved the films content together is so extremely impressive because it works so well. the film just flows. the transitions are so fluid. and the story itself is just so interesting that the way it shifts around itself creates so much intrigue and makes it so thrilling. just as integral as the way the story is presented is the characters that present it. vincent jules and butch are really just normal people in the world of pulp fiction but to the viewer theyre so much larger than life. not only do vincent and jules have an unforgettable chemistry as partners but what was really incredible to me was the chemistry vincent and butch had as enemies without even really knowing each other. the conflict between them created by just two encounters is astounding. jules though jules is excellent. a great character played by a great actor. samuel l jackson steals every single scene hes in. his monologues are legendary. this man must have needed some great vengeance and furious anger to be able to deliver those lines the way he did. he was one bad mother. i remember seeing parts of the film as a kid and wondering what the rest of it would be like. i thought seeing the whole movie would be like opening pandoras box on my concept of what a movie could be. looking back i think i was right.
