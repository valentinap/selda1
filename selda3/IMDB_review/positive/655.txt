personally i was and i am ashamed to say this quite late to join the huge number of film fans that would hold the shawshank redemption within their top 5 films of all time - if not number 1. if youre wondering mine is the princess bride childhood favourite but thats beside the point. i think the first time i watched it was in 2006 and i instantly fell in love with it. i now watch the film at least 5/6 times a year without fail and i am hardly ever far from tears of joy by the end. if you use the old analogy of if an alien came to earth show them how... to make a film you would show them this as the blueprint. just brilliant.
