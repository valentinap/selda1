in the far western reaches of south west wales i was lucky to be born to a father who had immaculate taste in film. at the tender age of 14 when i started to understand the complexity of human emotion i was introduced to this beautiful film. i remember the first time i sat and viewed the film my father put the vhs in the video player and left me alone to begin my relationship with this film from the age of 14 i reckon i must have watched this old film twice a year since and every time i still think this is probably the best film i have ever seen. just thought id express a little of how i feel about this film hope you dont mind. al
