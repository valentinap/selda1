the two best things about this film are the story-telling techniques and the imagery both proving that quentin tarentino is the finest film maker of our time the story jumps around in both time and place switching between a large set of seemingly independent characters and stories which all intersect to make a whole far greater than the sum of its parts and the juxtaposition of images is amazing: the rich drug kingpins wife overdosing on the floor of a low-level drug dealers home  the mob enforcers covered in blood in a suburban middle class house  bruce willis walking down some stairs carrying a sword wearing a white t-shirt splattered red with blood standing in front of a blue background and proving that there can be honour among thieves you dont so much watch the movie as experience it
