this film is a true fairy tale its dark its raw and its written from the dark raw experience of women maleficent is about what happens when your prince turns into a frog its the personal inner journey to recover from a physical trauma and emotional betrayal by those who are closest to us and who we trust the most its about how to survive that type of horrific evil without becoming evil yourself its message is that profound the critics complaining about this film want fairy tales to stay in the same onelovefitsall mode where people are either good or evil and that all one needs is to find romantic love and marry a good prince or princess and you will live happily ever after safe from any pain or sorrow but real life is a lot messier than that its actually evidence of how rare it is to see womens unfiltered subjective emotional landscape portrayed on film that it seems many of the critics cannot even wrap their brains around it no matter this film is so sensually visually stunning and viscerally emotionally cathartic that sheer word of mouth enthusiasm is going to make this a blockbuster no matter what the critics say and its equally rare to see a protagonist whose inner landscape is more complex than simply extracting revenge destroying their enemies androll credits people are more complicated than that fairy tale we are sold in every other action and adventure film that only serves to reinforce the psychopathic values of revenge and bravado sometimes a film is so ahead of its time that the critics are behind and so philosophically deep that its message is incomprehensible to the more superficial among us this is one such film woolverton and jolie have crafted a masterpiece dont miss it
