the dark knight is an perfect attempt from nolan to show actual dark side of society. where hero must pay penalty for chaos created by villain. this is an critic and perfectly meant to disclose acting skills of each comic characters of batman franchise. all credits has been given to ledger who drove this movie from an ordinary comic movie to epic one. interviews of heath was perfectly showing how much heath was involved in character the joker observed lip sucking gestures in interviews. any where we never saw heath in movie instead it was an agent of chaos. this movie is never overrated. this movie is over qualified for rating
