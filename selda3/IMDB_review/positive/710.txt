not being a huge fan of superhero movies i didnt have much expectations for batman begins. however viewing the 2005 christopher nolan production i was pleasantly shocked. then after my huge expectations for the dark knight christopher nolan blew my expectations to the dust. will the same happen with the 3rd and last film the dark knight rises quite simply yes my big expectations were once again blown away. what a production this is a true cinematic experience to behold. the movie exceeded my expectations in terms of action and entertainment. the editing sound  visuals direction and action are all top notch. this movie is amazing. it is interesting like all of batman are. when the end of the movie comes you start to turn surprised and you do not hope that. although this is the best thing of that movies. im in love with them. i do not know when this movie ends you are like: oh my god really it just happened there are no words to explain the feeling this movie causes in you. i love it. i suggest this movie to all the fiction lovers like me. you gonna love this movie. seriously.
