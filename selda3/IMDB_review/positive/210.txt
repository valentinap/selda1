this movie is one of the best ive seen if not the best i feel mr jackson should have gotten an oscar nomination for his role as jules forest gumps tom hanks wouldnt have stood a chance  john travoltas performance was good but could not beat samuel l jacksons portrayal of jules the hitman i liked the scenes being presented asynchronously giving the sense of peoples worlds being connected but they the characters not really being aware of the interconnectivity of their lives roles the violence in the movie is not gratuitous hope im using this word correctly  the car scene was especially good as was the cleaning of the car scene  dialogue excellent  and getting medieval on your ass will forever be with us  also going over this neighborhood with a blow torch and a pliers  what i also liked was the realism of the movie  i mean no cops around when you need them  in another movie the screen would have been swamped by blue and whites but not here  just pure unadulterated violence
