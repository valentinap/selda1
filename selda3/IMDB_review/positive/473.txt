the epic conclusion to this outstanding story. i have never watched a series of films that have been made with utter perfection that as you stare at the end credits you are left in awe of the pure brilliance of peter jacksons work - reflecting on what you have experienced throughout the trilogy. the combined flawlessness of the the acting the script the filming the special effects and most importantly for me the music have made this film a rarity of unmatched excellence that sets the bar for all other films. an outstanding achievement in film making that should be seen by all. a 10/10 for this film along with the previous two.  violent but in a cool way. shocking but in a cool way. i dont know how many times i have seen this film but i now see its so much more. its a rich intertextual film going experience. its a gangstar movie. for lack of a stronger term its a black comedy. its a renegade boxer story. its easy rider deliverance and shaft. its a film noir its a melodrama. its romance and action. its narrative flow is not just novel but near genious. if tarantino was only allowed to be credited with one film in his amazing career this would definitely be the one.
