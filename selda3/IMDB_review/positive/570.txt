richard linklaters boyhood might be one of my favorite movies of all time it works because it shares mundane and even quotidian details about everyday life in a way that enabled me to relate and reflect on how things have worked out in my own life as a boy boyfriend man husband and father scene after scene i was moved by familiar things depicted in the story songs neighborhoods classrooms teachers public placesfood and even conversations to me the genius of linklaters 12year filming timeline is that he was able to show how peoples personalities remain fixed over time and yet life experiences operate to deepen and redeem our characters those who come to this film looking for abstraction or arthouse pretentiousness preciousness? will be disappointed but if you watch this movie with attention to how your heart is reacting to characters and their development in each scene you will be strangely warmed maybe even encouraged and certainly challenged by the simple questions life poses that often take years to answer
