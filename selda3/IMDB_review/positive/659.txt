over the summer i had seen the advertisements and commercials for the movie guardians of the galaxy when i first saw the commercial all i could think was this looks silly and then i saw the fact it was part of the marvel series and i was torn whether or not to go watch it while it was still in theaters it did not look good but maybe it would play a big role in the marvel movie series but i did end of going to see it for the heck of it and absolutely loved it overall the movie was humorous very entertaining and in my opinion a great addition to the marvel series and even gained a rating of 92% on the movie critic website rotten tomatoes throughout the movie the thing that stood out the most was the humor part of the movie there were parts of the movie i just could not stop laughing because it was so silly and just so amusing to watch and enjoyable i mean the way you know it is a humorous movie is when you come out of the theater repeating lines and talking about parts of the movie and still just laughing as much as you did when you saw the movie and this is a movie that passes that test another killer part of the movie that made it so good was the soundtrack that went through the movie the biggest role the soundtrack has to a movie is to provide the noise for times where there is not dialog and just brings a smile to your face in the movie the main leader of the guardian of the galaxies starlord he plays a tape his mother gave him that brings back the classic musical hits that you just cannot help but sing along to and just smile while remembering the good old days overall the acting was pretty superb and each actor brought their own flare and became the character very well even just in the voice overs for characters such as rocket and groot apart of the movie that i really enjoyed was the way each actor had their chance to make their character shine and make them seem important and walking away you realize that each character had importance to the group and the actors all came together to form a pretty solid team called the guardians of the galaxies probably the most controversial aspect of the movie is the whole marvel aspect marvel over the years has made a killing in suckering viewers to come see their latest hits and leave us at the end wanting another marvel movie to come to theaters to continue the story i know many people saw the commercials thought the same thing i did who on earth are the guardians of the galaxies? most people know who spiderman ironman or even the incredible hulk are but unless you read the comic books you would most likely have no clue who the guardians of the galaxies are throughout the movie though i believe the writer did a good job in tying in the marvel universe and made a point by using characters most people would have no idea how they were connected to the story line that viewers have come to know through all other marvel movies and the big hitter that brings them all together the avengers going off the mpaa rating of the movie pg13 seems somewhat appropriate due to little bit of foul language and a couple of references to alcohol and gambling however i do think the movie can still be considered a family because it does bring a humorous aspect and nothing to raunchy is presented and besides what kid does not love a talking raccoon or even a tree that can only say i am groot overall i really enjoyed this movie and would definitely watch it over again marvel has done a very good job in adding a new addition to the movie series through the all the humor the acting the action the soundtrack and in the end i walked away from the movie hoping to see more of the guardians of the galaxies in future marvel movies
