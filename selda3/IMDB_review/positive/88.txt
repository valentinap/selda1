what is there to say about this movie except it is a triumph in film making. first of all anything narrated by morgan freeman you know is going to be a great movie. a story of a life behind bars with no end this ordinary man turns shawshank prison up side down. i think the fact that this movie is so simple is also the reason it is so great. there is no complicated cinematic techniques or special effects just men talking to each other. tim robbins shows us that the good guys can win even when their livelihood has been taken away. its the kind of movie that just makes you smile on the inside and lets you appreciate the simple things even if just for that day. the shawshank redemption is definitely a movie everyone should see only if just to brighten your day. but i think in the future it will prove to be an important mark in cinematic history.
