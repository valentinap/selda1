when i watched the nolans batman begins i was amazed by the film. i wasnt a kids movie it was haunting adventure of the dark defender and how he was formed. the intensity and the plot of the film were out of this world. batman begins was my favorite movie but then dark knight came along. the plot and the acting were superb and there were surprises till the end of the movie. the way nolan portrayed the joker was breathtaking. his laugh his attire and his acting was amazing. the actor who played joker heath ledger did an amazing job and will be remembered for this amazing role. may his soul rest in peace. nolan was also able to put the origins of two-face in the movie. harvey dent and later two face was very powerful. all he wanted was justice and to bring down every single criminal in gotham but one criminal joker changed him and made him into the villain of batman. joker indirectly killed the love of his life rachel dawes maggie gyllenhaal and made him go out for revenge and made him a killer. the two lives of bruce wayne were shown beautifully. his rich playboy life and his life as batman. dark knight was an amazing film and is a must watch.
