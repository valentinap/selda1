i think film is the most successful in the entire series. i dont want to say much about it because whatever is said cannot do it justice there is enough hype surrounding its release but its there for a reason. top notch film. bravo to nolan and his crew for giving a movie that batman truly deserves. the action is great and the plot is more deeper and engrossing. i applaud christopher nolan christian bale and especially heath ledger who sadly passed away earlier this year and all those aboard for believing in mr. nolans talents for this second installment. although some may feel a bit of melancholy over ledgers death but as a final note i will say this sincerely from my heart: remember heath ledger and honor him in your minds and hearts not only for his performances but as a human being and father to his daughter matilda ledger. may we issue him best wishes for his family and friends and his daughter for years to come.
