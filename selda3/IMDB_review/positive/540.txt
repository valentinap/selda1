story mission impossible follows an espionage team known as the imf impossible missions force led by jim phelps jon voight who were on a mission in prague to prevent a diplomat from the nonofficial covers list which is a list of all the secret agents in eastern europe when most of the colleagues in the team get killed the mission had failed and ethan hunt tom cruise was the lone survivor after the mission had failed after that hunt embarks on another mission to clear his name my thoughts although i had never ever watched the original tv show i didnt know what to expect from this movie when i first heard about it after watching mission impossible for the first time seven months ago i thought this was a really enjoyable spy thriller this is one of those movies where you must pay attention from beginning to end because there are some twists in there if you dont pay enough attention youll be really confused on whats going on i thought the plot twists in this movie were pretty shocking and the direction by brian de palma was great also there were only a few action sequences in this movie that were really gripping like the part on the train i was on the edge of my seat during that scene and when tom cruise is in the cia headquarters retrieving a computer disk in a secured room with the help of jean reno and ving rhames which i thought was reallywell shot i would call that scene as a rather quiet one but it was still gripping the acting tom cruise does a great job playing ethan hunt it kind of bugs me that people are saying that tom cruise cant act to save a life well try watching these movies and youll probably like him jon voight did great as the leader of the imf jean reno and ving rhames were great as the two agents who helped ethan on his mission in conclusion mission impossible is a great start to the mission impossible series which it had really good twists good acting especially from tom cruise great direction by brian de palma and it had some great action sequences 1010
