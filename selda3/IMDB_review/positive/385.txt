the shawshank redemption is undoubtedly the best best movie ever. the oscars biggest mistake was giving forrest gump the awards that shawshank deserved. not to take credit from forrest gump which is also an amazing movie but it just cant compare to shawshank. morgan freeman arguably delivers his best performance and tim robbins gives a performance that i feel is greatly underrated and also deserved an oscar nomination. the films art direction adds to the storys beauty and gives off a feeling that fills you with hope. i remember seeing the shawshank redemption on sale for $5 at wal-mart and thinking i heard this is good so i bought it. little did i know the film was worth more than gold. i bought the film and put off watching it for a couple weeks not overly anticipating watching it but finally decided to watch it when i was bored. i am a gigantic movie buff and have so many movies its almost pathetic but the shawshank redemption changed my entire view of film. now every time i watch a movie i cant help but think it cant beat shawshank. some people say that this movie is overrated but thats wrong. shawshank is an actual work of art to be compared with works of davinci and picasso. when people say this movie makes them cry they dont mean to say its so sad but that they didnt know that something of such beauty could be conveyed on screen. i believe that if everybody sees only one movie during their life it should be this one. see it now. after that imdb will seem like a whole new website because every film will seem like a different movie. it is by the very definition of the word magnificent.
