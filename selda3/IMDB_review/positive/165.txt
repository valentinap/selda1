this was one of the best movies i have ever seen my dad told me about this movie and at first i was reluctant to watch it because it looked old but after the first 10 minuets i was hooked it does kinda get confusing sometimes but you will defiantly pick up all the parts and by the end of the movie you will understand everything there is a perfect balance of action which includes blood shooting and wicked gun fights comedy because lets be honest samuel jackson is just down right hilarious there is a lot of cursing but it fits perfectly with the scenes i would totally recommend this to all of my friends couldnt think of a better way to spend a night then watching this movie 10/10 would watch again
