the shawshank redemption is without a doubt one of the most brilliant movies i have ever seen.what makes this film one of the best ever made is the message it conveys. it is one of eternal hope. andy dufresne played by tim robbins has been sent to prison for a crime he did not commit. but he never loses hope. he never gives up his quest to become a free man again. his years of tenacity patience and wits keep him not only sane but it gives his mind and a spirit a will to live. this film has a different feel to it. there has never been anything like it before and i dont know if there will again. the best movies are ones that touch the soul. it takes a movie like the shawshank redemption to touch the soul.
