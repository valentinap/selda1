where do i start those who have already seen this movie dont need a review and those who havent will probably never look at my review given the multitudes of others to choose from. so ill just say how this movie personally affected me as a fan of the books and of movies in general. i absolutely loved the original film fellowship of the ring and did enjoy the two towers though not as much. i loved the emotion of the original subtle scenes like frodos long decision-making boatside scene at the end and found that the two towers was great in action and scope but as a result sort of put character development and characters feelings into the background. but this makes sense as the book it was based on dealt more with action and also had the burden of introducing half a dozen important new characters. return of the king however is just simply fantastic. i try to avoid statements like gets everything right and i enjoyed every minute of it but in this case its true. i was so moved at the presentation of this film that i couldnt help getting misty at the end despite knowing exactly what would happen based on the books of course. i credit this to not only the great performances but also the stirring music annie lennoxs moving into the west is a beautiful tune and perfectly echoes the sentiments of the films themes. and also i couldnt help being moved knowing that it was now all over and there will probably never be another lord of the rings epic of this magnitude in my lifetime and rightfully so. i just felt like i was saying goodbye to old friends. the movie although beginning with an important flashback begins immediately where the second film concluded and every character has a conclusion. the main part of this movie that i loved is the simple fact that no character is shortchanged
