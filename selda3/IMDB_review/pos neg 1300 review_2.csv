score,textpositive,Zany witty funny stylish classic and masterful Pulp Fiction is my favourite film of all time Its delivers its laughs through phenomenal performances from Uma Therman John Trovolta Quentin Tarantino Ving Rhames Bruce Willis and Samuel L Jackson especially Tarantino is one of the few film-making geniuses that hasnt graced the world with enough of his works His visual excellence and stylish storytelling techniques are on complete display in this film Tarantino also gives us an ensemble of characters with flawed and yet unique personalities only Tarantino characters have His characters are impressive and yet very flawed very human and yet each and every one of them manages to be ridiculously charismatic and witty The writing in this film is absolutely flawless providing one of the most quotable scripts in history Pulp Fiction is a masterpiece of contemporary cinema that manages to be both effective and enjoyablepositive,Youd certainly have to be over a certain age to watch this movie. Not because it contains small amounts of very realistic and believable violence kids are used to that nowadays but very much so because of the psychological impact it could have. Forget horror ... if I was a kid and had seen this movie it would completely alter my perception of humanity given I would understand it. Once beyond that certain age this movie will impress you to say the least. Shawshank Redemption places a man in the wrong place at the wrong time early 1900s and in the worst kind of scenario. Hes convicted of the murder of his wife and sentenced to life imprisonment. This is how the movie starts. From this point on the majority of the scenes will take place in the Shawshank Prison Facility. Logicly as a viewer you side for the Andy Dufresne beautifly interpreted by Tim Robbins. It doesnt really matter whether you think he did it or not ... hes stuck in there and it looks like hell be there for a while. Friendships are born and enemies are made as you would expect. The way this movie maintains a thrilling storyline describing the friendships however is stunning. At the receiving end of one of those friendships is Red Redding Morgen Freeman a fellow inmate. Red can get you anything and as Andy Red is serving a life sentence. Lets just say they have the time to get to know each other learn from each other and eventually save each other. Because of the limited scenery the story and acting performance gets all the attention it deserves. If I had to condense this movie into a few words intelligence justice friendship being human redemption would all sound like understatements. Saying anything more about this masterpiece would spoil your viewing experience. Its just one youll have to watch if you love movies.positive,You only have to watch Pulp Fiction to get that QT truly understands the meaning of the word: Cool QTs movies are all about tough guys and centerfold hot chicks who talk about pop culture movies and music But its his sense of language and prose that define his style Like Raymond Chandler or Elmore Leonard he knows what great dialog sounds like and boy do these characters get a lot of cool things to talk about QTs characters are masters at exhibiting great one-liners but theyre also alive with unique quirks and eccentricities Mia is hip to knowing the difference between an Elvis-man and a Beatles-man Jules Winnfield exhibits a crude rough persona but can recognize a miracle when he sees one Butch is a boxer who is as much of a hero as a he is a killer In a movie where the characters are defined by their self-referential discussions and kinetic personalities they are in fact the pulp to the fiction However Pulp Fiction may also be best known for its splendidly memorable moments that have become a part of popular culture in of themselves Think about the dance off in Jack Rabbit Slims its not great dancing but the moment is fun and playful Or consider the most quoted scene of the film where Jules and Vincent talk about Big Macs Theres something visceral and even moving about the films style QT seems to be lamenting his own taste and ideals on worldly topics In fact you can determine what his very soul is driven by at the core of his dialog But its also a film that lends itself to the laymens quality of life where the characters do and say things that relate to what people actually do and talk about And also lets not forget the nature of QTs film making No other director has been so eagerly and shamelessly referenced in other films since Steven Spielberg Some of QTs best contemporaries are Guy Ritchie Matthew Vaughn and James Gunn  who are also known for their mesmerizing characters and self-referential dialog What they get is that QTs films are snub-nosed and brilliant with great inventive energy and personal to what QT is all about Like his predecessors who influenced him QT understands that skill and craftsmanship are only half the work and that a passion for sticking to your guns and making strong personal films makes up the bulk of all great Hollywood legends If you want to know what great film making is all about just watch Pulp Fiction and marvel at its excellence positive,You know what to expect. Youve read all the reviews youve heard how good it is from your friends so you know what to expect. You already know that Return of the King the third and final film in the amazing Lord of the Rings trilogy is an awesome and truly epic film experience. But for those who are still sceptical since LOTR is such a nerdy enterprise Im here to convince you to take a chance on this great film. First and foremost this movie is action-packed. Yes the beginning is besides some murder and frightening scenes pretty peaceful. But when the armies of Evil and the armies of Men have fully gathered together at the awe-inspiring city of Minas Tirith thats when the fun begins. Horses run over orks by the thousands giant Mumakil elephants trample everybody and an army of ghosts show up and slaughter everything. To top it all off we have a showdown between warrior-princess Eowyn and the undead leader of the Nazgul the Witch King and heck be darned if he isnt seriously scary enough to make hell freeze over with his voice alone. We also have Legolas taking down an entire Mumak SINGLEHANDEDLY. All this makes Return truly entertaining to watch since the intensity and suspense has already been setup. But this film isnt only about slaughtering orcs: there are several different genres mashed up here. The freaky scenes where the giant spider Shelob chases Frodo through her lair bring to mind the creepier horror films from the 80s such as The Thing. For any girls in the audience there is obviously the romance between Aragorn and elven babe Arwen and there is also Eowyns feminist-style charge into the thick of battle. The point isLOTR was not made for creepy little nerds to obsess aboutpositive,You know its really not the most entertaining movie ever made. you might look around the theater and see people yawning or even sleeping i guess its not avatar where you get CGI things or these 3D animation movie they make these days nor any batman or superman thing to thrill you with the action. What makes this motion picture special is that you will grow to love this movie  the first time you walk out of threatre you may not think of it as the greatest movie ever made  but theres something about it which makes you see it again and again and each time you see it you learn something new from it. you may be impressed by these great budget movie they make these days but you surely wont watch it a hundred times literally. Count my words you will watch this movie that many times. Its a story about hope as many people have already said in the review also about friendship and almost all these great human emotions. Great great soundtrack by thomas newton is like a cherry on the cake. The movie is so realistic and so much real at places it actually makes you angry yet its not a depressing movie like schindlers list or a fairy tale one like forrest gump  its just a story which gives you hope and strength to face life and value it. believe me lol i have watched a lot of movies and this IS THE BEST ONE.positive,You dont go and see a Tarantino written film without expecting to see guns gore vulgarity and everything else associated with graphic violence It is his style and he is a master at it The fact is if you did not like the film and you knew he was involved you can only blame yourself This particular film was well written Kudos to Roger Avary for helping Tarantino The film is definitely Oscar material that is why it received so many nominations in top spots Best Picture Best Actor Best Supporting Actor Best Supporting Actress and Best Director to name a few Unfortunately I believe the violence prevented it from winning any of the major awards but Tarantino and Avary did get Oscars for Writing it Their is talk about quarter pounders in France foot massages and what its like to kill a person If you can follow the film which basically runs backwards and if you are not offended by topics like violence rape and drug use you are probably a Tarantino fan already Finally who cares where Tarantino got his inspiration from 80% of that film was exactly what you expect it to be and 20% of it is surprises for you his fans Travolta Jackson Willis Rames and Thurman have my highest regards for a job well done I give the film a 10 out of 10 >positive,you could look long and hard and never find a film more fun to watch than missionimpossible its classy stylish and heartpounding first let me address the frequent complaints about an overly complex plot this is not true there are a few lines you shouldnt miss but pay attention as you watch and you will be fine ie dont wander off to get popcorn ethan hunt is an american agent who has been framed and falsely accused of treason and the murder of his team he strikes out to clear his name with a group of similarly disavowed agents together they must prove that ethan was set up and prevent a dangerous weapons dealer from accessing a list that would betray the identities of every american deep cover agent alive the story is well constructed without the typical action movie plot holes the film is well balanced between action and dialog but the best part of mi is ethan hunt whom tom cruise not only portrays but lives and defines a rare action hero with a brain ethan is quick fit savvy with both a computer and a gun driven and determined he thinks quick on his feet and doesnt look back but the most rare and valuable trait he possesses is his powerful magnetism and charisma he makes you like him and instead of coming across as arrogant his confidence and assurance draw you to him i almost never give a film a 1010 rating but missionimpossible is one of those rare films that gets every detail right theres nothing to dislike and everything to enjoyhighly recommendedpositive,you cant get more from a motion picture Morgan Freeman undoubtedly is a great actor and finding him as supporting actor in movies has been a culture in the modern cinema. The movie have a great plot the director did a great job concentration on the story have a solid field and the scope to keep you sticking to your chair the movie have such a dialogue delivery that you have to pause if you even blink your eye. Shawshank Redemption as the title is tempting so is the movie the star cast is great the performance cant get better and criticizing the all the rules and regulations of the society challenging the so many other other things the movie becomes a legend to the todays actors enough war movies enough jail breaks you have seen in movies but its all inspiring all contributing to the society and the diamond to the industry and the milestone for the coming actors is this. Tim Robbins performance is great as he lived the role and the eye stretcher movie shawshank redemption.  so it comes down to the Hobbits Frodo and Sam to bear the burden of the Ring and deal with the treachery of Gollum. After a long journey they finally arrive in the dangerous lands of Mordor seeking to destroy the One Ring in the place it was created the volcanic fires of Mount Doom.Notably it won all eleven Academy Awards for which it was nominated an Oscar record and tied for largest number of awards won with Ben-Hur and Titanic. Instead of starting just where the previous film left off however it goes far back in time to the moment the tormented creature Gollum first came to possess the One Ring. In this flashback actor Andy Serkis who voiced Gollum and performed his movements onset prior to the final CGI effects finally gets to appear on screen portraying Gollums former self Sm’©agol. This disturbing scene serves as a potent reminder that the Ring seeks to corrupt even the well-intentioned Frodo who is increasingly struggling with the dark power of the Ring himself. Thus the film returns to the present following Frodo Sam and Gollum as they journey ever closer to the foreboding land of Mordor. They pass by the terrifying dark city of Minas Morgul watching as the dreadful army of the Witch King sets out for the human strongholds in Gondor and move on to the rocky stairs to Cirith Ungol where an even darker enemy lies in wait. Meanwhile the rest of the Fellowship reunites in Rohan having defeated the wizard Saruman on two different fronts at Helms Deep and Isengard. They are not together for long though since the hobbit Pippin gets into trouble making it necessary for him and Gandalf to hastily depart for Minas Tirith capital of Gondor. Once there they find the steward of Gondor Denethor in an unstable mental state and the city preparing for battle against the amassing forces of Sauron. Denethor unwisely sends his only remaining son Faramir back into bloody battle to prove himself. He returns nearly dead sending Denethor over the edge of sanity.In another realm elf Arwen begins her journey to immortal life in the Grey Havens on her way to leave Middle-earth -- and Aragorn -- forever but has a vision that causes her to once again reconsider her decision. Back in Rohan the men are preparing to ride to Gondors aide. ’_owyn desperately wants to join the men in battle but her uncle King Th’©oden orders her to stay and defend Rohan if necessary. The hobbit Merry also desires to ride with the men but is denied due to his small size and inexperience. Aragorn is met there by the elf Elrond who brings him the re-forged Sword that was Broken in the ancient battle with Sauron and urges him to take a different route to Gondor. Heeding Elronds advice Aragorn along with elf Legolas and dwarf Gimli takes a cavernous path through the mountains where they meet ghoulish ghosts who betrayed Aragorns ancestors and are doomed to eternal unrest unless they fulfill their broken oaths by aiding him. All but Frodo Sam and Gollum will meet on the massive battlefield of the Pelennor before the gates of Minas Tirith. The former three instead engage in a battle of wills between each other and the One Ring as they head toward the fires of Mount Doom to destroy it. The thrilling conclusion to what has become the film event of our time - - the definitive screen fantasy -- features more spellbinding moments bigger battles more emotion and more poetry than the terrific first two films in the trilogy.It is visually stunning as it pops your eyes excites your senses and brings you in as close as a whisper for scenes of startling emotion.Jackson boldly and faithfully brought J.R.R. Tolkiens world to life as hes created the most epic and sweeping fantasy adventure of all time as evidenced in this third film.Aside from thatthe movie is great at all levels including the brilliance of the cast.Standing out amid an excellent cast is Elijah Wood stymied by tweeness in the earlier films but here convincingly developing the character of Frodo as the embodiment of valor and self-sacrifice.Aside from thatit provides the viewer a great tale of heroes bonded together by friendship and spectacular themes about very special friendship between hobbits Elijah Woods Frodo and Sean Astins Sam that touches us most of all.This is a masterpiece of filmmaking. positive,Yesterday I traveled 250 km to Athens Greece to watch the Dark Knight since I was in a town with no cinemas I was anxious after having watched Batman Begins and also curious to see for myself just how accurate the reviews that praised the film were and also just how good could Heath Ledgers acting really be. As a quick overall conclusion I must say that The Dark Knight is a masterpiece. Dont get me wrong but calling a film a masterpiece doesnt make it flawless and doesnt automatically grant it a 10/10 mark. Anyway in my opinion classifying a work of art as number 1263 or 134 of all time is a total waste of time. There cannot be any objective criteria in art and especially in films. There are so many genres so many different things a film can offer you and so many themes explored in the art of cinema that such a classification doesnt do any justice neither to the creators nor to the audience of a film. Starting with the storyline. The Dark Knight can be watched without having watched Batman begins. That is a very essential point. This is what makes a film whole and unique. Those ready to watch a cartoon -like comic book superhero film should not even bother... This is Christopher and Jonathan Nolans vision of a realistic 21st century metropolis controlled by organized crime actual mafia and every level of its infrastructure corrupt by it. Everyone knows that you dont want to mess with such a regime because the consequences will be catastrophic and unpredictable as in a war. And people are obviously scared. Therefore what is needed is someone to take this fear and through a symbol or an idea lash it out on the crime lords. This is Batman. But this will inevitably lead to war. A war where anything is acceptable and the heroes morals and methods are always put to the test because as symbols their actions can be checked only by themselves. But Batman is human and therefore flawed. Who gives him the right to decide whats wrong or right Therefore out of this war social instability grows and anarchy rises. That is what the Joker represents No morals no apparent motives other than the destruction of the social network. In Batman begins Ras Al Ghoul wanted to create a new order of justice through chaos. Joker goes one step further. He wants to establish chaos itself as the new order. The world is in a state of chaos anyway. Crime rules and the only one willing to fix things and give people the justice they deserve is a man dressed up as a bat Congratulations This is an idea worth watching on screen Why stay true to the cartooned image of previous Batmen when you can explore such a brilliant idea And the film is filled with several plot twists agonizing dilemmas and very meaningful dialogue. Of course there are minor flaws plot-wise. Sometimes the various events are a little confusing. The Scarecrows cameo appearance is out of place. He should have a larger part in the film or not at all. The mutation of Harvey Dent into Twoface near the end of the movie should have been explored more and at a slower pace. If there is one more film to complete a trilogy with Twoface as the main villain I would be content. The directing by Christopher Nolan is fast-paced and tight. The movie stretches to 25 hours but in such a relentless pace that in the end all you want is more The only objection is that some action scenes near the end are a little too chaotic. You cant really make out whats happening. But others could object that thats the way Batman works The villains cant really make out what exactly hit them in the end its all a matter of taste. Ive left the acting for last because of the hype surrounding Heath Ledgers portrait of the Joker. Well the rumors are true: Heath Ledger is breathtaking. His Joker is so believable and realistic that sometimes you think that the actor actually IS a homicidal psychopath and not just acting The comparison to any other actor in this movie is completely out of place. Heath Ledger is in a league of his own. And that is extra credit to him considering that the rest of the cast did a fantastic job also. My personal favourites were Aaron Eckhart as Harvey Dent Gary Oldman as Jim Gordon and Morgan Freeman as Lucius Fox. Michael Caine should have more screen time though. Least favourite was Maggie Gylenhaal. Contrary to the general opinion I preferred Katie Holmes. But overall the performances were outstanding. Christian Bale is left for last: This is my favourite vision of Batman. Bale continues the work he did in Batman begins. He creates a character complete in every way but in this film he somewhat lacks the emotional strength he had in Batman begins. Overall The Dark Knight is a complex crime drama of epic proportions filled with fast and banging action scenes ingenious storyline and brilliant acting by an all-star cast lead by a monumental performance by the late Heath Ledger. His Joker is not only the best comic-book-villain-on-film but also one of the best villains in the history of the film industry. Whether or not hell get an Oscar is totally irrelevant. After all Jack Nicholson never won an Oscar for his Joker... Who by the way should not be compared with Ledgers Joker because the logic behind each role is different. With Christopher Nolan behind the camera an actor as great as Jack Nicholson could have pulled off something similar or better. You can never know.positive,Yes Stephen King writes drama. He also wrote Stand By Me The Green Mile and Dolores Claiborne. He has definitely been typed as a horror writer when he is an amazing tearjerker. This film is amazing. Words cannot describe just how amazing this film truly is. I thought that I would not like this film as it looked like a bad sports movie. But when my science teacher told me I should see it because its a movie where you just go wow. I did and I was literally in tears by the end. Not in tears of sadness but tears of joy. Because the film was simply so beautiful. Not very many films have made me cry. Of course I cried at the endings of Marley and Me and Toy Story 3. But there are only 3 films Ive ever cried at. Some people say Citizen Kane or The Godfather are the best movies ever. FALSE. They are overrated. This film is a diamond in the rough. Most people are stubborn and wont even take this gem into consideration. It truly is the best movie ever. The music the direction the cast. I wont give anything away you need to see the film to appreciate its true beauty but I will say that the music in this film puts John Williams to shame and the movie reminds us that even in the most bleak of situations life can still be great. It is a great movie because it reminds us that hope is something that nothing can quench.positive,Yes It is definitely one of my top ten films I have made the point in the past that if an alien came down to earth and didnt know what a film was that this would be what we should show them It is a masterpiece in storytelling and general entertainment It is split into eight short chapters each with their own strengths but none which manage to disappoint You can jump in at any point during the film and be entertained as it does not focus very heavily on story but rather portrays the perfect mix of action adventure comedy crime drama and lots lots more It has a universal appeal and had me personally on the edge of my seat watching it due to its phenomenal tension and suspense I could watch it 100 more times and would not get bored Ive said it before and Ill say it again: This is the perfect filmpositive,Yes I loved THE DARK KNIGHT. It is a moody tale about the struggle of good and evil and everything in between. I want to go on and discuss particular scenes that I found to be powerful but I really think you need to go into it as fresh as possible. Surprisingly the trailers which seem to give too much away dont really come close to revealing what happens throughout. But what does happen is just as enticing as the brief glimpse during the preview. One complaint some may have is the length. It is around two and a half hours but frankly I didnt feel it. In fact a friend of mine who attended the screening with me looked at me after the end creditsŠ—_ he wanted to watch it again right then and there. I guess with any movie you should try and not build it up too much because there is always someone who wont like a certain film no matter what it is. Yet in the end Heath Ledgers Joker Aaron Ecklands Harvey Dent and a phenomenal vision realized by Christopher Nolan makes TDK easily one of the years best.positive,Yes Absolutely my nr 1 movie Quotes tension a nice story and last of all the actors Samuel L Jackson John Travolta Harvey Keitel & Bruce Willis Those four actors make the movie like its a shot from an ordinary day off a gangsters life Marvelouspositive,Yeah must admit. This is my fav movie of all times. If Tarantinos Reservoir Dogs was amazingly shocking this time is maturely shocking. It is just that way Tarantino drives the audience that leaves me thinking. Samuel L. Jackson John Travolta and Uma Thurman just rule. The scene where the last two dance at the Jack Rabitt Slim is one of the most simple and yet beautiful dance scenes in time. So does the restaurant scene with Honey Bunny and Pumpkin...its a total standout its that way that Samuel Jackson treats the situation...Really a blow-out a must see. All over the movie the audience keep thinking on what if... What if I shoot right here right now Yeah what Its just the way Tarantino plays with the wild emotions hiding into ourselves...He just blows peoples minds With this movie Tarantino has to be accepted as tha master he is both directing and writing.  and though I like Reservoir Dogs more Pulp Fiction is not too far away of being as great as that. And I must say too that Pulp Fiction should have won the Oscar that year instead of Forrest Gump. positive,wrote this elsewhere copying cause i dont feel like doing a new one ill start this by saying that this may not be for everyone metacritic currently has it at a 75100 which is understandable the movie can probably be best described as the campy james bond type spy movie for the modern age it takes the risks that no bond movie will probably ever take again not since the disaster that die another day was they make no attempt to hide this and halfway through the movie make it pretty clear that its what the film is going for without breaking the fourth wall until itkind of does break the fourth wall a little to enjoy the film youre gonna have to turn off whatever part of your brain governs rationality and skepticism because the tech and gadgets used here will cause your eyes to roll if youre expecting this to be a skyfall style spy movie seeing posters for this did nothing for me when i first heard about it then the trailers grabbed my attention what i wasnt expecting was just how violent it was going to be the action sequences are over the top to the point where the agents are superhuman again youre gonna have to turn your brain off a little to enjoy it if youre incapable of doing so just dont bother seeing it if you can i think youll enjoy it most of the theater who got advanced screening tickets applauded quite loudly twice they applauded the first credit screen then partway through it there was a bonus scene more applause at the end im not quite sure how colin firth has never been cast as a gentleman secret agent before he absolutely nails it samuel l jackson is actually pretty delightful as the villain with a disdain of violence not exactly a spoiler as this detail of his character was in trailers micheal caine is actually a touch disappointing in his role i feel like they really underutilized his talents wasnt expecting mark hamill to be in it but was pleased with his appearance and his british accent was completely believable if i hadnt seen pictures of hamill prepping for star wars 7 i wouldve thought he was just some random british middle aged actor mark strong was solid in his role but nothing too fantastic the big surprise to me was taron egerton who i had to look up ill admit the lead of the film the guy who kind of looks like josh hutcherson it honestly is quite impressive to see him go from this british bruv to towards the end of the movie a sophisticated secret agent with honestly the charm and wit of james bond the transformation is believable and impressive looking back on the movie that may be my favorite thing about it and given that hes only24 i think? i dont think its completely absurd to consider him to eventually replace daniel craig maybe hes not the best choice but hes made my list might not grow out of his boyish face but if he does he should get a call anyway aside from the individual performances the movies plot is completely ludicrous in a fun way the violence is over stylized but the humor is quite fun after seeing all the comedies ive seen certain jokes are just predictable and kingsman has its share but some jokes are quite surprising tldr summary intentionally campy a lot of fun if you dont expect a serious spy film quite funny super violent at times i can only really compare it to 300actually no this is more like a spy version of kickass really but its not quite as gory more entertaining than most movies i saw last year if theres a sequel i will watch it also sophie cookson may just be my new celebrity crush and also my ticket was free through the advanced screening service im signed up for but when i find time im gonna pay to see it againin 13 ****ing days edit back to the kick ass comparison i think if this is well enough received as it was for me and the friend i took to see it it may enjoy the same cult classic status luckily forit it will come way before the big blockbusters of 2015 will hit theaters may give it enough time to gain that appreciation in my personal opinion its better than kick asspositive,writerdirector richard linklater is no doubt one filmmaker who has not received the spotlight he deserves in the hood of hollywood he has directed such wondrous films as before sunrise before sunset before midnight school of rock dazed & confused and much more however this mid 40s boy is about to get the attention he deserves for his marvelous work in writing & directing the comingofage flick boyhood and when i say comingofage i really mean it boyhood took 12 years to film it captures the life of the young protagonist mason jr from the time he is 5 years old all the way to he is 17 it was filmed in bits and pieces in a 12 year span linklater formulates a viable authenticity in the life of a child to teenager family life insecurity identification stability discovery etc mason jr is a child of divorce and linklater develops mason jr not so much as a victim of an unstable family life but a young survivor who still maintains his noble dignity throughout lifes experiences ellar coltranes astounding performance as mason jr from child to teen is of oscar caliber ethan hawke and patricia arquette also delivered excellent work as masons divorce parents mason sr and olivia linklaters reallife daughter lorelei linklater shows that the linklater talent is being passed on quite splendidly with her solid performance as mason jrs sister samantha this is no childs play boyhood is one of the best movies of 2014 ***** excellentpositive,Writer/director Quentin Tarantino demonstrates his encyclopedic grasp of filmmaking by bending chopping and deconstructing narrative while keeping a groovy beat Brilliant and brutal funny and exhilarating jaw-droppingly cruel and disarmingly sweet All the details are executed to perfection Ironies abound in the smallest situations The experience overall is like laughing down a gun barrel a little bit tiring a lot sick and maybe far too perverse for less jaded moviegoers The movie resurrects not only an aging genre but also a few careerspositive,Writer and director Quentin Tarantinos Pulp Fiction qualified as a revelation when it came out in 1994 and time has not diminished the impact of this landmark film This crime melodrama about a pair of philosophical hit men a treacherous boxer a cocaine-snorting drug dealers wife and a cleaner shifts back and forth between tragic drama and helium comedy with irony galore If Tarantino had not made any other movie he would still have been assured a niche in cinematic history with Pulp Fiction He juggles four complicated plot lines about an eccentric gallery of characters who are all low-lives in one way of another living on the fringe of society whether they be murderers thieves narcotics dealers sexual perverts or small-time pistol-wielding crooks Pulp Fiction defies chronological time because Tarantino stages everything out of order This fractured form of storytelling might alienate those spectators accustomed to chronological order Not one minute of this marathon two hour and forty-five minute audacity is dull Ultimately Tarantino and co-scenarist Roger Avary received the Oscar for Best Original Screenplay while the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences nominated Tarantino for Best Director the film itself for Best Picture John Travolta for Best Actor Sally Menke for Best Editing and Samuel L Jackson and Uma Thurman respectively for Best Supporting Male and Female roles Over ten years later Pulp Fiction is still outstanding largely because it is such a timeless tale of amoral mayhem Tarantinos quotable dialogue his articulate underworld thugs and his archly sardonic take on life retains its vivacity Inspite of the scrambled up stories Tarantino plots everything very carefully foreshadowing situations and predicaments with characters facing the consequences of their actions Tarantino inspired a generation of movie makers but none of them have come close to eclipsing his masterpiece Pulp Fiction opens in a restaurant with Ringo/Pumpkin Tim Roth of Reservoir Dogs discussing the various problems involved in the art of robbery with his girlfriend Yolanda/Honey Bunny Amanda Plummer of The Prophecyand their impulsive decision to rob the restaurant Colorful credits follow and Tarantino introduces us to Jules Samuel L Jackson of Shaft and Vincent John Travolta of Saturday Night Fever as Vincent talks about the difference between what hamburgers are called in Amsterdam A quarter-pounder is called a Royale with cheese and most food is referred to using the metric system They arrive at an apartment where they are supposed to pick up an attach’© case from four twentysomething guys as a part of a deal that went south Jules questions Brett Frank Whaley of The Doors about the guys questionable business practices with Jules boss Marsellus Wallace All the dumbfounded Brett can utter after he witnesses Jules shoot one of his friends on a sofa in cold blood is the word What Jules warns him not to say what again Nevertheless Brett says What five times and Jules puts a bullet in his shoulder Vincent and Jules retrieve the mysterious suitcase but not before another guy bursts from the bathroom with a cannon like revolver and fires indiscriminately at them The guy misses each time and Jules and Vincent blow him away and leave with the case and another bystander Marvin Phil LaMarr of Old Dogs after they kill Brettpositive,Wow What can we say about this film. It is one of the best of all-time that is no question. It has altered my perceptions in a lot of ways. I had not read the books so I felt that I could safely watch the film without nit-picking at all the details the movies had left out. I found some people doing that but even those people said it was still pretty true to the story. Knowing that and also getting the thrill of experiencing the Lord of the Rings for the first time was unbelievable. I had watched The Fellowship of the Ring for the first time on video and I was immediatley hooked. When Two Towers came out I had to see it the first day out as well as REturn of the King. I also did some research on Tolkien after that and found some reasons of why he wrote it as well. Knowing that he wrote it because he wanted to and not just to make a point was astounding to me He just loved to create characters drama and just plain good storyline. Noone does that anymore Yet I was truly inspired. I have never been so inspired by a movie. It literally took my breath away I believe we are all living in the Lord of the Rings. Whatever your adventure is wherever your heart is at whatever challenges you face we can all learn from Lord of the Rings. There is always hope.positive,wow what can be said about interstellar that hasnt been said before? so ill just share my thoughts and feelings about this movie the nolan brothers have hit yet another homerun with this intergalactic masterpiece the story is about a single father whos trying to raise his children and provide for them and his father in law the world is sick very sick in fact cropses are dying and harvests are lost farmers have become the worlds most important job but soon humanity or at least a very small part of it realizes earth can not be saved and that they have to turn to the stars to find salvation matthew mcconaughey has come a long way since his roles as a piece of mancandy in chickflicks and he proves it yet again here he plays his role as cooper perfectly the heartache he has to go through while making an impossible choice really pulls you into the story saving humanity or seeing his children once more anne hathaway fits the role of brand well shes not sexualized as she was in the dark knight rises which gives her the chance to win you over with her acting and win you over she will michael caine is michael caine so you know what to expect there greatness jessica chastain is wonderful as murph shes so strong yet so fragile and its just heartbreaking to watch her emotional journey cassey affleck takes on the role of murphs brother and does a great job theres one more surprise appearance by a big actor which i wont spoil for you you can already tell the acting jobs are top notch in this picture and they have to be the story touches on some existential themes which are difficult to comprehend you have to understand and feel the emotions the characters are going through to grasp the purpose of the story fully visually interstellar impresses with actual physicists working on the movie you get the most accurate pictures of unearthly events the visual of black hole gargantua is actually being used in a scientific publication the other planets the team visit are equally stunning as they are interesting without going in too much detail the planets feature things we all know but they are portrayed in a way youve never seen before now let me take the time to gush over the music in this film you may think the music isnt as important as the acting or the story but its with music this good you understand it is actually a character in the movie the music is gorgeous its epic when it needs to be and emotional when the story requires it i found myself nearly in tears over the music when i didnt expect it hans zimmer proves he can create delicate and fragile pieces of music as well as epic dark and heavy soundtracks like he has done for the dark knight trilogy so in summary interstellar isnt just a space movie it isnt a science fiction movie at heart its a movie about humanity and about saving it and not just in a literal sense its about finding our own humanity its about family its about love because that is the main theme which drives the characters its the core foundation for all their actions and choices but above all this film is about hope its about believing in ourselves and the power we can muster when we fight for our loved ones interstellar is one of the most amazing movies ive ever had the privilege to see please go see this filmpositive,Wow what a movie Its not only the best of The Lord of the Rings trilogy it also is one of the best movies of the past couple of years. The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King is a totally spectacular movie. It has some of the most amazing battle scenes in movie history. The word spectacular isnt good enough to describe it its breathtaking epic and emotional involving. Who didnt wanted to pick up a sword and shield and charge with Aragorn towards a large number of Orcs for honor and glory Even though the special effects are far from the best ever Peter Jackson is a master in mixing the special effect with real life action. The use of it never feels overdone and the result is spectacular as well as believable. I think lots of people were worried after The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers after seeing the battle of Helms Deep. How was Peter Jackson ever going to top that great battle Well with The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King he topped it alright The battle for Middle Earth is something youve never seen before. Greatest moment was when the riders of Rohan charged it was really a moment in which you felt the true meaning of fighting and dying with honor. Also great moment during the immensely large battle were the fights against the oliphaunts just when you thought the battle was over those large creatures appeared Really great moment. The characters are possibly at their best in this movie. No characters need introductions anymore and we get to see the deepest of their emotions in this movie even Gollums Still the movie is not really deserving to be third in the top 250 here on IMDb.com. Its also not really deserving all those Oscars it won. Like all The Lord of the Rings movies its great spectacular and absolutely breathtaking at times but not classic masterpieces in my book. Also the movie is far from flawless. Once again the editing is just poor at times and what was with the ending Couldnt they just think of one ending I expected the end credits to start rolling multiple times during the ending but it just went on and on. Despite some of those flaws it still is an excellent movie with some unforgettable battles sequences. Truly a wonderful ending for one of the greatest movie trilogies in history. 10/10 http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/positive,Wow what a film this baby is and yes this film is one of the most brilliant films ever written by man and i for one was literally stoked from the start so as a future film maker i hope to one day make a film like this because if i do i will definitely die a happier man. the film was just awesome in every sense and i really loved the plot it had some great cliff hangers and great and classic scenes where the main character became himself more and you just fell in love with him so on that basis i would class this film as one of the all time greats and if you havent seen it yet go out and buy it because you wont be disappointed at all believe you me.positive,Wow this movie is so good Ive seen it 200000 times now.

Christopher Nolan Has done it again with this masterpiece. The movie has everything. It cannot be better. The highlights of the movie are Obviously the Joker. Heath ledger has taken the movie to a better level. The brilliance of is acting has made joker more liked than the Hero of the film. The Dark Knight is the best batman movie ever made and no one should miss this movie. This is the best movie of the century. Harvey dent is also awesome in this one. The characters are really real. They look like real life characters rather than comic ones. The joker the batman Harvey dent commissioner Gordon Rachel  Alfred  fox all of them have done a Mind Blowing Job. The movie has exciting background music done by Hans zimmer. The entry of joker is surprising. And the climax of the movie is very intense.positive,WOW I honestly do not know what else to say except wow. Usually superhero kind of movies do not really impress me but this one is incredible Wow wow wow wow Anyone who loves good directing good story lines incredible acting great art and absolute awesomeness will really really really love this movie. Its going to be one of those movies that I will not forget for a very very long time. I was not so thrilled to watch the movie at first because I was very sad and shocked about what happened to Heath Ledger. But a few years later I was bored and decided to just A movie. I stumbled upon The Dark Knight and decided to try and watch the first half and if I didnt like Ill just look for another movie to watch. Well the movie was amazing that I was was hocked from the first few minutes. I was watching intently the whole time. R.I.P to the amazing Heath Ledger. What an incredible and an unforgettable performance you will be badly missed If you havent watched this masterpiece then I recommend you do.positive,WOW Christopher Nolan created an absolutely amazing batman movie. I loved everything about the movie. Batman was always my favorite superhero. I watched batman begins all the time as a kid and it became a favorite of mine. Then I saw The Dark Knight in a movie theater when I was 7 or 8 and I was totally blown away by it. The Dark Knight was perfectly casted. Christian Bale made an incredible Batman Heath Ledger as the Joker was the best acting performance of all time and I doubt anyone will top it anytime soon. There were so many great scenes like the Interrogation scene the chase scene the bank heist intro Joker crashing the party Joker exploding the hospital and Jokers magic pencil trick. Batman is the best superhero ever and the Joker is the best super villain ever and The Dark Knight is the best movie sequel ever.positive,words cannot explain the thoughts i have on this movie unlike the new xmen i think the more you think about it the more you like it although both movies were equally good guardians has a good humor vibe throughout the movie with a compelling plot and an ultimately brilliant outcome of a movie i may even see it again i have read the comics before the movie was thought of and let me tell you it was very true to the characters and let me say i had doubts about vin diesels talent between groots small role in speech but now i dont think anybody else could have matched how well he performed marvel can surely be at the top of greatness at the moment with its movies however i highly doubt that and i cannot wait for the next installment of superhero action brought to us by marvel roll on josh brolin and his take on thanospositive,Wonderful movie by all standards I did not find any faults worth mentioning Cast: wonderful Output: terrific Production: Excellent Everything perfectly I loved all the actors and the roles that they Performed ----------------------------------------------- Battles: The last thing ..... frankly I did not watch the epic movie to such a degree Battles give you a real sense of performance The story in general is very beautiful and not where any faults worth mentioning The course of the story as well as a very very same story Excellent cutting scenes Excellent graphics Filming of Professional. I do not know what to say more than one piece only ... Thanks to everyone who contributed to this wonderful workpositive,Without doubt one of the most endearing stories to touch the human soul. Very rare a film succeeds in taking the mantle away from the novel. However this is one of those cases when it simply just does. This soul finding awe inspiring against all the odds film is a great adaptation of Stephen Kings 1982 Novella entitled Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption. This is the film that will make you think that there is hope in the world and that with great perseverance anything can be over come. Set in the times of what looks like the depression and located within the backdrop of the sleepy south of America. A man sent to prison for life for a crime he did not commit and how this alien world of the lower reaches of society seem at first that he will be broken and beaten and either die or go mad as so many of the inmates succumb to. As Simon and Garfunkel had their books and poetry to protect them me so the lead character Andy Dufresne has his to protect him from such failings. In Rita Hayworth he has a passage of physical escape as opposed to the virtual world of books. He gains respect over time not through physical violence but by the craft of his mind and sheer willpower. Like a chess master he is thinking several moves ahead of everyone. Even the old master lag played by Morgan Freeman can only watch this man from a distance. However he relays through mainly past tense commentary how this man was as GB Shaw would say was Superman. Eventually like a great master he exposes the lieshypocrisy and greed of the evil church going warden. This is not a film but a journey to the very survival of the human soul and as the lead character passes through leads a golden light on those condemned even if only for a passing moment in time. Like a bird on a journey he is destined to be free. Enjoy this film because it may if only for a moment save your soul.positive,With well adapted characters more direction than a compass and loads more power than a puch from Mike Tyson this film is an absolute must-see. Tarintino the director which brought us Reservior Dogs and True Romance has created what I claim as a top 10 in cinematic history.  Casablanca One Flew Over the Cuckoos Nest Raging Bull The Godfather Reservoir Dogs Schindlers List TGTBTU Taxi Driver Goodfellas L.A Confidential Apocalypse Now Fight Club and so on and so forth. I would recommend this or The Godfather for any person that wants to get IN movies. Since both are classics and impossible to dislike. 11/10 positive,With the final installment coming through everybody can recognize the greatness of not only The Return of the King but of the trilogy as a whole. Despite not being a fan of fantasy movies i was completely taken by the magic of the story and particularly Peter Jacksons incredible ability to transform such a complicated story into an epic movie and raise the scales of film making. The Return of the King grabs audiences and places them in with the characters one by one. It is no surprise at all for the movie to swap 11 Oscars and we all surely will be looking to the upcoming two installments of The Hobbit to see if Peter Jackson can outdo himself. Rating: 10/10positive,With ÎâBatman BeginsÎŽ by Christopher Nolan tried something brash . A reboot to the film path of the famous hero of DC Comics who had already experienced four transfers to the big screen with the original inspired top touch of Burton. The 2005 film  however constituted a more management - an attempt to prepare the hero  something that you would complete in a future sequel despite an expected attractive adventure . And because the cinema management and preparations -profile within the limits of the sail hardly enjoy direct assessment and acceptance the challenge is quickly forgotten . As the next ... The ÎâDark KnightÎŽ is a film Haunted . The question that arises is whether this feeling is due solely to the unexpected death of Ledger and Expenses  presence on the big screen . There is a flood of stimuli that attack you throughout the course of the film and this is enough to convince that the film not only enjoyed by the tragic circumstances of a death . In one scenario is pervasive gloomy atmosphere and as the story progresses it becomes increasingly conscious . Traditional clich’©s blockbusters canceled by anarchist way  particularly in the second half  where anything can go wrong goes and all that is dominated by death and loss . All main characters dominate the screen without nevertheless thwarted action . The Bale experiencing two natures hero literally torn . The Eckhart - probably the most favored role screenplay - initially posing charming hypnotized us as soon as his character changes the standards . The Oldman despite strictly earthly existence of the role is never on the sidelines . The Maggie Gyllenhaal and loses if the impressions in the last scene of overall standing in the only decent actress . The Morgan Freeman and Michael Caine can not help but complement beautifully cast in two key roles . Make no mistake  though. The true protagonist of ÎâDark KnightÎŽ no different from Heath Ledger and the Joker . Is itself a living horror  a freak storyline than their worst nightmares . In some scenes may remind you of a psychotic alter-ego of Edward Scissorhands or something of the unique otherworldly figure of Hannibal Lecter. Thanks to him much the movie looks so dark and threatening. Personally at least  it took me a few seconds to inspiration magic scene input to  forget  that the same role was impersonate the great Nicholson. Combining creative logic of a blockbuster with a full script and insightful directorial eye of Nolan the ÎâDark KnightÎŽ gives the best explanation for the original intentions of ÎâBatman BeginsÎŽ. In a film where various identified - operational - oddly  it is not surprising that the major disadvantage is also a paradox . There is so much to 145 minutes can hardly meet the viewer from only one view . Despite the apparent lack of economy  however  the  Dark Knight  looks capable resurrect halls in lean periods . And do not be surprised if you found high in the preferences for the upcoming Oscars without going necessarily refer only to level roles Ledger background music or art direction . Sorry for bad English :positive,With more than 3000 reviews there isnt much to say about this masterpiece. But it deserves many more reviews. This is a film of a lifetime. Seriously. It crosses all the lines of its genre in order to give all of us a showcase of every name involved. Not only Christian Bale or Health Ledger are unforgettable. Everything in this movie camera script performances story action direction is at the highest and beyond. Its a movie made with style and groundbreaking aces on the hood. It could be shocking that this movie is so considered in all film lists across the world. But be prepared to be moved and surprised. At present day the filmmakers can still deliver masterpieces to audiences than can destabilized the ancient classics. This is a new classic. And it even deserves the #5 spot for me. My own parents guide: Sex & Nudity: 1/10. Very poor content of this and just passionate kisses. Violence & Gore: 8/10. This is not a so violent or graphic movie but when it comes its really intense and sometimes upsetting the jump scene with the false Batman Two Face looking most of Joker attacks against people which includes plant an explosive inside a man stomach kill one man with the infamous magic trick scene.... Profanity: 5/10. Some language but not so remarkable. Alcohol/Drugs/Smoking: 3/10. Very poor content again. Nothing too much relevant. Frightening/Intense Scenes: 10/10. Its not about frightening except for the jump scene but it does about intensity. The whole movie is brilliantly dark and extremely real with people and situations really hard and truly moving at times. This is the most intense Batman movie. Even more intense and violent than the next one: Rises. Total: 27/50. Despite this can be a so low mark of explicit content in a so convoluted movie like this one its a really NOT FOR KIDS movie and one of the most intense superhero movies ever. And the most disturbing in Batman trilogy.positive,with all of the talk about heath ledger getting an Oscar I feel that it is only right to state that that was not him. Arkham mustve given the joker an early parole to appear here because for all accounts that was the joker I saw on screen as this was the most realistic portrayal of my favorite villain that I have ever seen. It has been a long time since i have clapped at the end of a movie but it seems I was not alone as most of the packed audience I was viewing with had to agree. This has to be considered one of the best movies of the year the scope and vistas were spectacular and this was Batmans against the Joker in a tour De force effort that both the writer and producer should be proud ofpositive,with a director like david fincher you can expect a few things the man has a speciality for creating extremely effective thrillers and hes also very good at adapting and being faithful to source material such as 2011s the girl with the dragon tattoo gone girl is a bestselling novel from 2012 written by gillian flynn who also wrote the screenplay and stated that it deviates from the novel i can confidently say it has been a long time since ive gone to the theatre and been captivated by an entire movie sure there has been some stellar pictures out this year but to actually sit down and be absorbed into a 2 hour 30 minute film and want more from it by the end is very impressive considering a majority of the years biggest movies appear during awards season nick dunne ben affleck and his wife amy rosamund pike seem to be the ideal couple from humble beginnings to a whirlwind engagement at face value no one could doubt how flawless a couple they seem eventually on the day of their fifth anniversary amy goes missing nick calls the police who do their duty yet after studying the apparent home invasion remain suspicious her disappearance creates a media frenzy turned witchhunt and nicks behaviour and surfacing lies surrounding the marriage are interpreted by the media and public as characteristics of a sociopath did nick kill his wife?

The movie has already been rated as possibly one of the greatest movies of all timepositive,Why Shawshank Redemption isnt rated 9.9/10 is beyond me. What has caused me to reflect and comment on this film is the small things...99.9% of movies miss them. A movie is a photographic montage of images with sound and is meant to represent a story. Humans have always enjoyed stories from time immemorial huddled around fires in caves to modern things like FaceBook or YouTube its all about stories. Shawshank has many small instances that Frank Darabont included like when Red leaves a small note to Andy with a free poster when he returns from the hospital/isolation. Another small instance is when Andy gives Red the harmonica it could easily not have been filmed but it touches everyone with its deeper meanings. Its a collage of many small instances that make it meaningful and memorable over and over again. I am convinced thats why everyone loves this movie and watch it repeatedly its the small things that touch you. How many movies have given you the most important small message of all...of hope...its the most powerful of goals we can have hope really sets you free.positive,Why is The Dark Knight so serious For many good reasons. Christopher Nolan is a true auteur who can take a simplistic comic book story like Batman and turn it into a complex psychological movie with plethora of character study. He has directed Christian Bale into the most serious Batman character of all. He sure did direct the late Heath Ledger into performing as the best Joker of them all and Ledger did not work to upstage Bale or the other actors in any way. Ledger should definitely win a posthumous Oscar for his scary performance of a clown who possesses deep wounds. If Christopher Nolan was old enough he should have done Batman movies instead of Tim Burton or Joel Schumacher put together. Tim Burtons mood was dark as well but as Im looking at it now Michael Keaton was a more sloppy Batman Kim Basinger was a mousy Vicky Vale and Jack Nicholson overdid his Joker performance. In Batman Returns also directed by Burton and starring Keaton the commercialism continues adding Michelle Pfeiffer as a more idiotic Catwoman than the Catwomen on the 1960s TV series and Danny DeVito who still was a wounded Penguin but not enough that we feel sorry for him. Then in the mid 1990s Keaton didnt want to play Batman anymore feeling he was upstaged by all the villains. Looking for more actors often typecast as villains director Schumacher got Tommy Lee Jones to parody his villain persona as Harvey Two-Face Dent. Also there was still that rubberface persona in Jim Carrey as the Riddler as well. 1997s Batman and Robin was a total washout. So Nolan came to rescue this moribund franchise and made his own franchise moody with dark colors mature less focus on the action and more on the story and detailed development of each character without exploiting them. In 2005 Batman Begins was just the beginning but The Dark Knight is the real story. It would be sin that Christopher Nolan does not get nominated for an Oscar just as well as Heath Ledger for best director. Christian Bale is and many people would agree with me the best Batman of them all. With his rich performance we do know him better than Adam West Michael Keaton Val Kilmer and George Clooney put together. We know Bruce Waynes haunted past and demons and why he becomes his alter ego Batman to fight crime in Gotham City. Unlike Cesar Romero and Jack Nicholson Heath Ledger is a much more complicated joker. He doesnt torture people just for pure torture. He doesnt laugh maliciously between every single sentence. He grew up with such an abusive upbringing that he wants to exploit Batman as a fraud for Gotham City even bringing in Batman clones with the typical Caped Crusader outfit on the crime scenes just to tell Bruce Wayne Will the real Batman stand up All the other actors give excellent detailed performances. Maggie Gyllenhal gives a stronger performance than Katie Holmes Mrs. Tom Cruise as Bruce Waynes love interest Assistant D.A. Rachel Dawes but is smitten with D.A. Harvey Dent Aaron Eckhart in the end. Gary Oldman in one of his few good-guy roles does a fine turn as the mustachioed Commissioner Gordon more serious than the one weve seen on TV. Veteran thespians Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman are always a treat to watch as the faithful butler Alfred and the gadget inventor Lucius Fox. These two men get better with age each time they make movies. And Aaron Eckhart plays Harvey Two-Face Dent not as a torturous villain like Tommy Lee Jones did before but as a victim wounded by the Jokers torture in a gas chamber out to seek revenge with his coin as his calling card for what could be good or what could better yet turn out for bad on his intended targets. The summer of 2008 had a lot of movies. Ive seen Mamma Mia as a light feel-good musical comedy riddled with off-key singing notably by Pierce Brosnan. Ive seen Wall-E which I thought was Pixars blander efforts. Remy the rat from last year upstaged this robot on all costs. But The Dark Knight is the best movie of the summer. When it comes to comic book stories as I said before directors Burton and Schumacher got all caught up in themselves with too much action and seemed to forget their audiences. Nolan never does.  there is nothing to say. It is just exceptionally plain good. A must to see movie for everyone that carries a heart. positive,Why do I want to write the 234th comment on The Shawshank Redemption I am not sure - almost everything that could be possibly said about it has been said. But like so many other people who wrote comments I was and am profoundly moved by this simple and eloquent depiction of hope and friendship and redemption. The only other movie I have ever seen that effects me as strongly is To Kill a Mockingbird. Both movies leave me feeling cleaner for having watched them. I didnt intend to see this movie at all: I do not like prison movies and I dont normally watch them. I work at a branch library and one day as I was checking The Shawshank Redemption out to one of our older patrons she said to me Whenever I feel down or depressed I check out this movie and watch it and it always makes me feel better. At the time I thought that was very strange. One day there was nothing on TV except things I absolutely would not watch under any circumstance or things that I had seen too many times already. I remembered what she said so I watched it. I have watched it many many times since then and it gets better with every showing. No action no special effects - just men in prison uniforms talking to each other. The Shawshank Redemption and To Kill a Mockingbird are the best movies I have ever seen. I do not judge it by its technical merits - I dont really care about that. I have read that Citizen Kane or The Godfather or this or that movie is the best movie ever made. They may have the best technique or be the most influential motion pictures ever made but not the best. The best movies are ones that touch the soul. It takes a movie like The Shawshank Redemption to touch the soul.positive,who would have thought colin firth could play such a suave james bond type? he displays enough cockiness looks quite dapper in his custom made suite and can probably pick up any babes he wished if we had more time in the movie jackson also has the time of his life with his speech impediment villain in addition to that we are treated to the training phase of the future spies and unlike birdman where theres nothing funny this parody skewers the genre giving us action fan plenty to cheer throughout the entire movie we have the gadgets the action scenes the incredible requests to earn certification and become a member of the select few we meet the fatherless hero who must prove himself worthy of the recognition and hone his natural talents to be able to save the world who wouldnt love the poisonous tip oxfords the cool pens key chains and doesnt that umbrella come in pretty handy before and during a lethal encounter? in order to give the film more panache we have to include michael caine who has already graced a few batman films with his class and mark strong adds a touch of cerebral ability as he must prove his resources are after all important to succeed in this era what is most important here is the amount of fun we have throughout the film? loved the intimate dinner between the two adversaries the sexy villain who proves to be quite a challenge during the entire adventure and it is plenty of fun to see some of those selected few get their due as they find themselves once again worthy of salvation just because they have more money than the rest of the world of course the villain plans are both hideous and hilarious as we see which groups are depicted in the movie most of them are one step short of getting into that type of frenzy anyway so it wouldnt take much to trigger that type of behavior this is a movie that is a bit over two hours but we dont want it to end because it is so much fun there are films out there that are overpraised because it looks like theyre trying to be original as they criticize satirize or make a halfhearted and pretentious parody of other genres kingsman is an example that the film makers are able to wink an eye and tell us these types of films are excessive with just too much of nothing in order to pack it with special effects to hide its creative weaknesses but this one also shows that you can show intelligent commentaries without dragging or calling too much attention to it i cant remember how many times i look at my time during birdman but i had forgotten i had a watch or a cell phone while i laughed and rooted for the heroes and villains equally and there were a few unexpected turns which gave me some faith about the simple fact that we can still hope to find some fresh material out there we might getting too much of the marvel universe with a break needed soon it is also important to note that originality and creativity and their blend with comedy and action are really difficult when they were done a good work of art doesnt try that hard to call attention to itself instead its all there and it flows naturally on its way to its welldeserved recognition without the overeager critical support to tell us how great it is when it really isntpositive,Whilst some may argue it is over-long The Return Of The King is simply too powerful with too many wonderful elements and is ultimately too great an achievement to not be in my list of favourite films of all time Peter Jacksons adaption of this story whilst having the occasional stumble along the way was ultimately stunning. This film ties up the themes of the previous two instalments of which there are many in an emotional tour de force on a rather grand scale. When you have performances from a top-notch cast in a film about ideas as fundamentally moving as this you are hardly going to go wrong and at the centre of it all is the friendship between Frodo and Sam so brilliantly played by Elijah Wood and Sean Austin. Friendship loyalty sacrifice love and the struggles we all face can be found committed to film in the intense few hours of The Return Of The King. The reason Lord Of The Rings worked so well is that it did not become a stage for special effects which are wonderful as shown in scenes of battling with a giant spiderpositive,while batman begins was all about batman the dark knight is all about the joker... the perfect villain as they sayperhaps there hasnt been any character so evil or any actor so perfectly portraying the evil. Heath Ledger has outdone all his previous performances with just this one role of his hope he were with us to give us more such enthralling performances. R.I.P. the movie is going to be remembered for ages to come but not because in the end the good wins over the evil but specifically for the evil. Ledger according to me has done the best performance in a negative role in the decade. the director Christopher Nolan has lived up to his reputation that he created with the following kept up with memento the prestige insomnia and batman begins and looks like the young director to watch out for along with Zack Snyder and Robert Rodriguez.am anxiously waiting for his inception coming this year.positive,whether real or fiction if a story presents to us an example of loves transformational power it is a story worthy of our attention the reason so many of us do not waste our time learning how to love those who are difficult to love is that such a love requires a great amount of courage on our part first we must be willing to face and embrace every dark aspect of ourselves no matter how large we imagine our imperfections to be no matter how great our sense of shame over our past mistakes may be secondly to love one who is at first difficult to love also requires that we soften ourselves enough to be changed if we go the distance in learning how to love in this way the process will always transform us for the better unfortunately we do not have a lot of examples in our cultures movies books or stories of what such a transformational act of love looks like fortunately disneys film maleficent gives us such an example to all who participated in the production of this film i say well done beautiful story beautiful imagery beautifully acted and beautifully produced i felt my heart was glowing as i left the movie theaterpositive,Where to begin with this movie This is truly my favourite movie and one of the best movies of the last decade. That is no understatement. From the start you are drawn in into a movie which depicts the demise of Gotham City and the emergence of a truly great actor in Ledgers depiction of the Joker. Why is the movie so perfect Its quite simplepositive,Where do I start When I first heard of The Shawshank Redemption I immediately wanted to watch it mostly of its title so as I always do I looked it up on IMDb and looked at the rating. It was the highest ranked movie on IMDb and of course I would give it a go. The beginning was very interesting with Andy being convicted of double homicide and seeing the lean-back of what happened. Him being found guilty serving two life sentences in the toughest prison in America Shawshank. I thought it would be another overrated boring movie like The Godfather but no it caught my attention from the start and never lost it either. The dramatic scenes it gives you a glance of how it is in prison the emotional scenes. It is all a masterpiece there is a reason to why it is the best movie I have ever watched and probably will ever watch. The amazing acting plot and moderate length. The last scene with Red walking up the beach towards Andy and the credits slowly rolling in it makes you beg for it to never end. When it comes to movies I can sometimes get a little emotional if its a good movie which Shawshank is. It definitely deserves the spot as #1 I cannot understand how it didnt win an Oscar. I really recommend this movie to anyone who wants a good weekend but get a load of potato chips and soda since you will finish it all up very fast.positive,Where do I start Those who have already seen this movie dont need a review and those who havent will probably never look at my review given the multitudes of others to choose from. So Ill just say how this movie personally affected me as a fan of the books and of movies in general. I absolutely loved the original film Fellowship of the Ring and did enjoy the Two Towers though not as much. I loved the emotion of the original subtle scenes like Frodos long decision-making boatside scene at the end and found that the Two Towers was great in action and scope but as a result sort of put character development and characters feelings into the background. But this makes sense as the book it was based on dealt more with action and also had the burden of introducing half a dozen important new characters. Return of the King however is just simply fantastic. I try to avoid statements like gets everything right and I enjoyed every minute of it but in this case its true. I was so moved at the presentation of this film that I couldnt help getting misty at the end despite knowing exactly what would happen based on the books of course. I credit this to not only the great performances but also the stirring music Annie Lennoxs moving Into the West is a beautiful tune and perfectly echoes the sentiments of the films themes. And also I couldnt help being moved knowing that it was now all over and there will probably never be another Lord of the Rings epic of this magnitude in my lifetime and rightfully so. I just felt like I was saying goodbye to old friends. The movie although beginning with an important flashback begins immediately where the second film concluded and every character has a conclusion. The main part of this movie that I loved is the simple fact that no character is shortchangedpositive,Where do I even begin with The Lord of the Rings Trilogy It is one of the finest film trilogies to ever make it to the big screen. Peter Jackson was admittedly an unexpected choice of director for the trilogy. Before Lord of the Rings he made The Frighteners Bad Taste Meet the Feebles and Heavenly Creatures. Heavenly Creatures was his first step out of absurd cinema and then after The Frighteners came out in 1996 The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring was released in 2001 and became a critical commercial and prestigious success. The Two Towers had the same success in 2002 and finally The Return of the King came and was the greatest of The Lord of the Rings Trilogy and the first ever fantasy movie to win the Academy Award for Best Picture and went on to win the BAFTA for Best Film and The Golden Globe for Best Picture - Drama. The Return of the King won all these awards for the right reasons. It was epic gorgeous a story that has been told consistently great from start to finish and everything works. Lord of the Rings is one of those tales that will live on forever and ever. J.R.R. Tolkien would be extremely proud even if his son Christopher isnt proud of the movies. The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King will be remembered and still be considered one of the finest movies ever made. An achievement on an epic cinematic level and a cultural milestone.positive,Whenever this movie comes on I have to watch it. This movie is very compelling and if you have not seen it Im not going say much to spoil it for you. This movie takes place over a few decades of wrongful imprisonment of a banker who is accused of killing his wife. The time spent in prison is sought with so many horrors as I saw it especially for a man who never should have been imprisoned. The end is great and after the movie is over they just leaving you hanging on a Whats next Like no other. I have seen many movies leaving you or trying to leave you hanging but every time I see the Shawshank Redemption I wonder what occurred after the beach.positive,Whenever I talk about this movie with my friends I do not even refer to it by title but rather as The Movie. When I say The Movie my friends know exactly what Im talking about. In fact the main reason that me and my friends dont refer to it by title is because this movie is so great that we do not feel worthy enough to say its name in vain I still remember the first time I saw The Shawshank Redemption. Some friends of mine and I went to see it at one of those Budget Theaters over the summer of 1995. None of us really knew anything about the movie but we had heard that it was pretty good. So not having any real expectations we saw it. When the final credits rolled and the lights came on in the theater all of us just sat there with our jaws hanging down on the floor. I turned my head towards my friend Bob and said That was the greatest movie I have ever seen in my entire life Theres really no other way I can put it in words. Every moment of this movie captivated me and inspired me to believe in the one true thing in life...... HOPE. This movie is sad uplifting inspiring harsh cold funny at the right times jaw-dropping and heart-warming all at the same time. I get chills every time I watch this film and this film contains the greatest ending which takes place over the last 30 minutes or soin movie history How it all just comes together is so incredible and uplifting. I should also mention the music in this movie is nearly flawless as well and the soundtrack is a must buy for any music fan. The only bad thing about this movie is the fact that I know I will never see a better movie no matter how many I may see. Ive seen many movies over the past few years many excellent films. However every time I walk out of the theater I turn to my friend or family member that I saw it with and I say That was a great movie but it wasnt nearly as good as you know what There have been many movies over the past few years that thought would really move me or that I might one day call my favorite of all time but theyve all fallen far short of The Shawshank Redemption. So if you have yet to see this movie please run to the video store immediately. Youre guaranteed to find it in the employee picks section. And if it isnt in that section then you should tell the employees there that there is something seriously wrong with them. If you have seen this movie go see it again. If you havent bought your own copy yet buy one. In fact buy two and put one in a fire-proof safe just in case of an emergency. :o So you want a 1-10 rating I give it a 13  Casablanca One Flew Over the Cuckoos Nest Raging Bull The Godfather Reservoir Dogs Schindlers List TGTBTU Taxi Driver Goodfellas L.A Confidential Apocalypse Now Fight Club and so on and so forth. I would recommend this or The Godfather for any person that wants to get IN movies. Since both are classics and impossible to dislike. 11/10 positive,Whenever I see a prison or even think about it the first thing that comes to my mind is this film. Maybe its because I have watched this masterpiece so many times that its actually made a place inside my head and will never go away. I just cannot explain how well this film is made. The direction and screenplay by Frank Darabont and the fact that it is based upon Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption by Stephen King makes it highly likable. Moving on to the performances by Tim Robbins as Andy Dufresne and Morgan Freeman as Ellis Boyd Red Redding they shine just like a diamond stupendous performances by them. I still cant believe that it never got any major accolade and didnt even make much money but still it has developed into something sensational which cant be missed.positive,When you think of great films you think of Pulp Fiction Inception Se7en The Godfather and The Dark Knight. This is because of its brilliant acting captivating storyline interesting characters and excellent dialogue. The Dark Knight has all of these things. As everyone knows Heath ledgers performance was spectacular and Aaron Eckhart as Harvey Dent. It is directed and co-written by Christopher Nolan Inception Memento and co-written by David S. Goyer Man Of Steel Blade. It has just the right mix of action character development emotion and jokes. All in all it is a classic movie and will live on through out the ages as the best superhero film of all time.positive,When you look at IMDbs top 250 you see many famous and ambitious films like Star Wars The Godfather The Lord of the Rings and others. Not saying that these movies are bad they are actually quite brilliant they were made famous because of the publicity and the abilities these films had in the time. Star Wars started the sci-fi age The Godfather made people interested in the secret society of the Mafia and Lord of the Rings brought life into the fantasy genre again. But what really made these sublime films so popular was the publicity and the fantastic special effects which costed certain amounts of money. In 1994 Frank Darabont decided to have a go on one of Stephen Kings novels not knowing what would happen. They made a film that is honest and that contains on the contrary to Star Wars etc. a vital lesson a meaning and a message to all who watch it. This movie is redefining cinema. No explosions. No heart-stopping excitement. No its pure poetry music and sublime acting. The overwhelming and intriguing story introduces banker Andy Dufresne played by Tim Robbins who was falsely convicted for a double life sentence in the heavily guarded establishment of Shawshank Prison. His life must go on and he makes friends with other inmates like Red wonderfully acted out by Morgan Freeman and Brooks Hatlen James Whitmore brings tears to your eyes. Warden Norton played immensely evil by Bob Gunton and Captain Hadley Clancy Brown dont make Andys life comfortable in the prison but with Andys unique skills he manages to win their attention and gratitude. This film has some terrific moments like the helicopter shot over the Shawshank Prison and the stunningly beautiful scene where Andy locks himself up in the Wardens office and plays Mozart to all the inmates. Morgan Freemans raw voice makes this moment more powerful than any other moment in any other movie I ever saw. At the release of the film people criticised the film harshly and wasnt a big hit certainly not at the box-office. But when the film appeared in the stores it became an enormous hit. And until this day for over 4-5 years now I believe it stands on the second place in the top 250 one place away from The Godfather. This is a film you have to see once in your lifepositive,When we learned about the new batman series I thought it would be a total failure. Batman Begins really proved me wrong and I was set up to be pleased if each of them was as good as Batman Begins. Lets just say this movie blew away the first one and 99.9% of every other movie ever made. Bale played Batman perfectly the best yet. What really made this movie as good as it is was Heath Ledgers performance as the Joker. It was one of the greatest performances ever he simply nailed it. Michael Caine was the usual Michael Caine he was great. Another person that made the movie as good as it was is Aaron Eckhart he played Harvey Dent just like I imagined Harvey Dent. Then when he became Two Face and his personality and whole character changed he nailed it too. Of course Gyllenhaal and Freeman were great as well and the rest of the cast. If you havent seen this then do yourself a huge favor and see it.positive,when the name christopher nolan comes to mind we think of memento the prestige inception and the dark knight trilogy as films that changed challenged and kept audiences in awe of what each of those films bring but his latest offering is indeed not only up there with the best scifi themed films such as inception gravity and 2001 a space odyssey as it plays an inspiration for interstellar along with other acclaimed science fiction classics but one of the best and original pieces of film made this year ill try not to give too much away but the story is centered on a not too distant future where the earth has become unsustainable for the human population dust storms scour the land and mankind itself has reverted to crop farming for food but with little luck to boot cooper matthew mcconaughey is widowed and once was a nasa test pilot and engineer but resides now as a crop farmer alongside his teenage son tom younger daughter murphy or murph as her nickname and fatherinlaw donald murph believes that ghosts are trying to communicate her and they have given her coordinates of a possible location to discover but it leads to secret nasa group lead by professor brand michael cane who theorizes that a possible wormhole discovered orbiting saturn could lead to possible new worlds for human colonisation and asks for coopers help in leading the expedition along with his daughter amelia anne hathaway and 2 other nasa astronauts the events that follow take off will lead to an adventure like no other thats visually spectacular emotional and engaging as said nolan has topped this works with this marvelous gem being based by theoretical physicist kip thornes work nolan gives us the scenario of human life in another universe and taking 4 years to write the most realistic script alongside his brother jonathan the final result was indeed different to what i and others were expecting the direction as always is spot on as already seen in his last films he takes story seriously pace is steady but never broken and characters are never wasted in his vision the amount of time that was taken to be convinced on screen was a long journey for nolan and his crew through financing development writing etc but the end result was indeed captivating and a step up in terms of science fiction in film the casting and performances are all fantastic these include oscar winners matthew mcconaughey anne hathaway michael caine and jessica chastain and a surprising appearance of another one but i wont be revealing thisthe supporting talents of wes bentley topher grace john lithgow casey affleck and the voices of bill irwin and josh stewart are all  mcconaughey in particular has amped up his acting roles since his role in the lincoln lawyer and only this year won best actor for dallas buyers club he gives not only a realistic depiction of man losing not only his reason for existence but yet redeem it all for the sake of mankind but he conveys emotion hope and yet convincing enough to be the films hero hathaway similarly does this as well with excellence and has driven herself to be involved in captivating films since les miserables expanding her acting range the topping performance of all in my opinion  was jessica chastain since seeing zero dark thirty she can be incredible in drama driven roles and breathing life into her characters so im betting she will get oscar attention alongside mcconaughey and hathaway music here is incredibly captivating and who else to deliver this is award winning and highly acclaimed composer hans zimmer a favorite of mine to listen to to describe intersellars zimmer says that the textures the music and the sounds and the thing we sort of created has sort of seeped into other peoples movies a bit so its time to reinvent the endless string ostinatos need to go by the wayside the big drums are probably in the bin and like 2001 the music is beautiful and plays a role in the storys emotion visual effects here are becoming more cgi than practical but nolan highly prefers the practical magic and minor cgi to bring the realistic effect the use of miniature effects built and designed sets and production are all in for oscar worthy attention and this was possible because of visual effects team double negative overall interstellar is a captivating engaging and emotional film release of the year and only a year after gravity had changed the mold on science fiction but interstellar adds more with its concept cast music and atmosphere that creates a beautiful journey to the unknown that will indeed earn oscars wins in the next awards seasonpositive,When The Dark Knight was first released everyone was going to see it even if they hadnt seen the previous Batman Begins simply because it was Heath Ledgers last completed role - and what a role it was. When you watch the film for the first ten minutes when you see Heath on screen you remember how he is sadly no longer with us and are reminded of the tragedy. However when the Joker visits the mob and performs the pencil trick Heath becomes the Joker. Its a rare occasion when you find a character so well performed that you forget its an actor but Heath did this astonishingly well. Its hard to find a weak link in the acting in this film. Christian Bale adds an almost comical edge to Bruce Wayne with his hints of mockery when it comes to talking to or about Harvey Dent. Bale also performs Batman well despite the odd voice which you get used to. Aaron Eckhart is another actor whose performance is excellent. His noble character of Harvey Dent is great but its when he becomes Two-Face that you really see Eckharts skill. Its a shame this side of his character is only shown for the final part of the film but he like Heath Ledger is able to totally immerse himself in the character. The familiar characters played by Gary Oldman and Morgan Freeman are welcomed again in this sequel and Maggie Gyllenhaals replacement of Katie Holmes as Rachel Dawes is also not controversial and Maggie acts very well. The script itself is full of twists and turns and leaves you gasping for the finishing half of the entire film. Christopher Nolan has done an excellent job with this film. Perhaps not his best ever script but its definitely his best film so far it will be difficult for him to create the sequel for this film as he has simply made an excellent film here which is difficult to beat.positive,when someone tells me words cannot express i typically laugh at the absurdity as a writer i conceitedly believe that there are always words for everything however i must bow to this clich_ words cannot express what i think of richard linklaters boyhood given that its been a little over 12 hours since i saw the film and im still speechless i ask you to bear with me in this review

time to stretch some more boyhood is the best film of the decade still limber no stretching needed this movie is that incredible it all began with an innovative idea from the already innovative richard linklater what if we see a family grow and age through the eyes of a child? and what if we shot it in realtime? from there a spark was ignited and eventually came to a glorious flame we do see a family age for 12 years this idea is already a selling point for the film but then throw in mr linklaters usual touch of heart and authenticity and youll have something undeniably special youll have an intimate epic a film that is so large in a technical scale and equally large in emotional sale is something hardly seen especially in the past 12 years so when boyhood premiered at the sundance film festival there was a lot hype and this excitement hasnt expired after several months instead it has grown it has traveled through america crafting an astute reputation for the film to follow so for filmgoers like myself who live in small unartistic towns find ourselves overwhelmed with praise for a film we must wait for and we did i personally waited a full monthandahalf for this film to hit

electric patricia arquette early on in the film we get a sense of the living conditions of olivia but instead of shifting the narrative towards her we stick with mason and remain oblivious to the full condition of olivias life in many instances there is nothing heard or seen that mason isnt hearing or seeing if his parents are fighting in the next room we dont see it because mason doesnt see it after a few minutes mason spends time with his father ethan hawke at his finest mason sr is just what youd expect hes your typical absentee dad one who only shows up with gifts and fun but never seems to be serious about raising a family however since we see things as mason does this dad is awesome and greatly missed at this point the plot becomes clear this is a film about a broken family to scrutinize the plot would be to write an 1115 page review there is so much going on within each year of the film that the 12 year story is impossible to break down into a simple synopsis after the first 1215 minutes of the movie the film cuts to a new year 2003 and we find the characters have moved on from the last this process is continued throughout the entire film till we reach adulthood in 2013 and with this formula a masterpiece is crafted there is something so psychologically groundbreaking about this film never before has a film been so relatable so memorable and so poignant as each year appears on the screen we the audience subconsciously immerse ourselves into the same time period we recall what we thought and did in that year and find ourselves nostalgic this feeling is especially effective for members of masons generation like myself we recall the same thought patters and experiences mason goes through as we went through them with this intimacy we find ourselves reliving our childhood this beautiful feeling is something no other film has caused this is why boyhood is so groundbreaking because it is able to captivate its audience and allow us to have a relationship with it what mr linklater has done is not only craft a work of art but allow the audience to view the crafting of the work of art brick by brick line by line side by side for anybody involved in this film whether it be the filmmakers or the audience members there is an intimate oneonone feeling that transcends both time and reality and for that we are indebted to the filmmakers

However as the story progresses you find out how amazing it really is. Yet how can a film that contains rape beatings and suicide make you feel so good at the end Frank Darabont manages to do this so well. The Green Mile gives you a warm feeling at the ending but not like this does. I just love the way it follows the subplot of Brooks right up until he kills himself. How touching that was to see an old man let out of prison but without routine. He belonged in prison not in the outside world. You forget at times that you are watching a movie. It sucks you in and moves you. If you havent seen Shawshank you have missed out on one of the finest movies ever made. But dont worry - youre not beyond redemption Watch itpositive,When it comes to Quentin Tarantino OP delivers and this movie is by far one of the best four in one stories or tales of violence and redemption out there True that the actors are pure talent but in connection with a mind-blowing storyline the result is easy grandiose Words cannot dare to describe what feelings you may have while watching Crime drama thriller and a little mystery in a Tarantino movie can overcome decades of action movies The point is that im not trying to praise the director in any way I just think that its a must to express warm approval or admiration of him Genius minds are a rare occasion to come in contact with GG Tarantino positive,When I went to theater expecting something similar to Batman Begins an average good all around action movie. What I got from the Dark Knight is a perfect beautiful masterpiece with very little flaws if any. Heath ledger is a master at his role. He is the best villain in any movie I have ever seen. It is a shame he died because he is a very good actor. Christain Bale had another good performance and the rest of the cast had great showings. The plot was great and I have to say that Heath ledger is a great great joker and no one can match him. Heath ledger is another new edition to the cast and is a good prosecutor. Batman learns more about himself fighting joker then he ever imagined.positive,when i went into kingsmen i had no idea what to think i had not doe my research and went into the theater with moderate expectations thinking i was going to see a mediocre cheesy movie about british spies but i was so wrong kingsmen is about a ultra secretive spy agency that is trying to save the world although a very common plot this movie was made so that is was very unique despite a clich plot the longer i was watching the movie i kept on realizing how much i loved the movie it was filled with unique action an unforeseen plot and a great quirkiness that enhances the film so much along with all of these features the movie was filled with a class a cast it was a very well neededwellrounded moviepositive,when i went into kingsmen i had no idea what to think i had not doe my research and went into the theater with moderate expectations thinking i was going to see a mediocre cheesy movie about british spies but i was so wrong kingsmen is about a ultra secretive spy agency that is trying to save the world although a very common plot this movie was made so that is was very unique despite a clich_ plot the longer i was watching the movie i kept on realizing how much i loved the movie it was filled with unique action an unforeseen plot and a great quirkiness that enhances the film so much along with all of these features the movie was filled with a class a cast it was a very well neededwellrounded moviepositive,When i watched this film i thought now whats this going to be like After watching it i thought it was a brilliant filmfantastically acted with greats like Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins and Bob Gunton. Very realistic and definitely one of my absolute favourites of all time. At the end it made me cry and thought about life. Every time i watch it the film brings a tear to my eye. Fantastic film and worth watchingits really realistic film and another one of stephen kings great stories a story of hope and many people who have watched will say the same thing - if you havent seen this film already then watch it it is brilliant just brilliant be prepared to be moved its such a breathtaking journey for the whole two hours. A truly lovely magical film my favourite of all time fantasticpositive,When I watched the Nolans Batman Begins I was amazed by the film. I wasnt a kids movie it was haunting adventure of The Dark defender and how he was formed. The intensity and the plot of the film were out of this world. Batman Begins was my favorite movie but then Dark Knight came along. The Plot and the acting were superb and there were surprises till the end of the movie. The way Nolan portrayed the joker was breathtaking. His laugh his attire and his acting was amazing. The actor who played joker Heath Ledger did an amazing job and will be remembered for this amazing role. May His Soul Rest In Peace. Nolan was also able to put the origins of Two-Face in the movie. Harvey Dent and later Two Face was very powerful. All he wanted was justice and to bring down every single criminal in Gotham but one criminal Joker changed him and made him into the villain of Batman. Joker indirectly killed the love of his life Rachel Dawes Maggie Gyllenhaal and made him go out for revenge and made him a killer. The two lives of Bruce Wayne were shown beautifully. His rich playboy life and his life as Batman. Dark Knight was an amazing film and is a must watch.positive,When I watched Shawshank Redemption at firstI had been in the high school and this film left a good impression with me I say that I learned how to follow your passions and hopes how to struggle to be free. And  dont never forgethope is good something and good somethings never die  this sentence which passes in the film I always believe it every part of mine. Because A person lives with his or her hopes and passions so If it is seized from peoplethat people lose their aims in the life. And what the best properties of this film It shows that hopes and passions are indispensable for people...In addition to my review about Shawshank Redemption Whenever I watch this film I learn that it puts in new things my life. It is so important for every watcher Shawshank Redemption should be watched and I advise it to you :positive,When I walked out of the movie I was asked what I liked about it. Everything I answered. Everything was nearly perfect about this movie: the action scenes were intensepositive,When i saw this movie first time i just said how good can be because whenever i watch a series first film that i know if the first film would be great i know that the second one would be terrible but this series its just been increasingly much better than the first one. Christian Bale returns as Bruce Wayne the billionaire playboy who moonlights as Batman. Having eased more comfortably into a lifestyle of excess Wayne lurks on the fringes of his familys corporation as CEO Lucius Fox Morgan Freeman runs the boardroom. But when an ambitious district attorney named Harvey Dent Aaron Eckhart comes forward to challenge Gotham Citys villainy through proper legal channels the man also known as Batman sees an opportunity to replace his vigilante persona with a figure of virtue who will truly inspire the best in the citizenry.positive,When I saw that the Shawshank Redemption was #1 on the top 250 movies of all time I thought Yea I could understand that. I dont necessarily agree that its absolutely the best but it is so good that it makes sense that a forum of popular consensus for film rankings would rank it at the top. It is the story of Andy Dufresne played by Tim Robbins and his time at Shawshank Prison. It is a perspective of what it is to be human and to have hope for the future even in the face of insurmountable adversity. Its funny because I dont really think that any one particular thing stands out as spectacular. The performances are very good but nothing really noteworthy. The characters all serve the story beautifully but none of them really stand out from the others. Frank Darabont is great the shots are exactly what they should be. Almost the entire film is shot at the prison adding to the feeling of isolation and routine. And yet we are captivated from the outset. Morgan Freeman could read a Sears catalogue and Id pay to hear it his narration breathes life into every scene that its spoken over. The real beauty of this film is its story mostly about Andy and Red Robbins and Freeman but its the way that each character contributes symbiotically to the development of the story that is the absolute mastery. Stephen Kings novella Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption was the short story that was used as the basis for the film and it serves as evidence that King is not just a master of horror but a true literary genius. Sure he doesnt use as many fifty cent words as histories other great masters but does anyone tell as good a story King always gives his writing such distinct atmosphere and energy that you cant help but get swept away. The Shawshank Redemption is no different. If there is a film by which other films should be judged this is as good as it can get. Powerful engaging visceral despairing a masterfully woven dialogue of what it means to be human. Its one of those journeys of the human spirit that just makes you feel happy to be alive. An amazing story translated beautifully to the screen. A masterpiece 10/10.positive,When I saw Pulp Fiction the first time I knew instantly that I have to see it over and over again The cast directing story and everything matched completely in a way that I love them to match Tarantino made an outstanding job in this film and I was very very disappointed when the movie did not receive Oscar for best film or best direction This loss made me realize for sure that the best ones are not the ones to get the so called highest recognition But anyhow Pulp Fiction is and probably always will be the movie that I want to see over and over again and also the one that I want to remember for the rest of my life >positive,When i rented the movie i was doubtful whether to rent it or not. Then i started watching it. From the very 1st moment i was kinda sure it wud be worthy watching this  the serious violence of American gangster movies crime movies and films noirs mixed up with the wacky violence of cartoons video games and Japanese animation  and the fragmented story-telling structures of such experimental classics as Citizen Kane Rashomon and La jet’©e. The Oscar-winning script by Tarantino and Roger Avary intertwines three stories featuring Samuel L. Jackson and John Travolta in the role that single-handedly reignited his career as hit men who have philosophical interchanges on such topics as the French names for American fast food products  Bruce Willis as a boxer out of a 1940s B-movie  and such other stalwarts as Harvey Keitel Tim Roth Christopher Walken Eric Stoltz Ving Rhames and Uma Thurman whose dance sequence with Travolta proved an instant classic. positive,When I first watched PULP FICTION I was completely controlled by its energy Tarantino was able to lead the entire audience around like Pepe-la-Peu was lead by the scent of perfume I have since watched it countless times and realized that the details are what carry this movie The big picture the basic stories the characters the situations that bring them together is extremely interesting and alone would have been sufficient Yet Tarantino threw in details that you wouldnt notice were placed on purpose For example listen to the dialogue and notice how references are made in passing Notice that the reason Mia ODd was because she snorted heroin thinking that it was coke since it was in a baggy rather than a balloon Tarantino set that scene up subtley in Lances bedroom almost an hour before the OD Many movie-watchers go over a film with a fine-toothed comb in order to find mistakes that the director or the actors made In PULP FICTION Tarantino raises the bar by giving us treats to find within the detailspositive,When I first saw this movie on video I was in 5th grade I expected to see a action film because Bruce Willis is in it but after the movie was over I was confused and totally lost by this movie The second time I saw it I was a junior at high school and I was totally fascinated by this movie As shown in Reservoir Dogs Tarantinos answer first question later scenes are unique and amusing to watch Also the dialogues are hilarious such as conversation about foot massages and actions are bit too violent but also great I also enjoyed John Travolta and Uma Thurmans twist scens a lot The actings are superb John Travolta Samuel L Jackson and Uma Thurman gave their best performances in their careers Bruce Willis was still pretencious but he was OKpositive,when i first saw this movie i was pretty confused and i had to see it a couple more times before i understood it all many critics hated mission impossible because of this i liked that it was very complicated it added to the mystery i think the part in the cia terminal room is classic very exciting this is one of brian de palmas best he throws lots of surprises at you tom cruise and ving rhames are always good together and i liked emilio estevezs part *** 12 starspositive,When I first saw the Shawshank Redemption I was in a movie theater on a week night at around 11pm. I had gotten out of work from working the evening shift. I was tired and just wanted a little amusement. This was at a time after Shawshank had been released but got little attention. I had heard some Oscar buzz so my curiosity got the better of me. I half reluctantly chose to watch it. That night I was not prepared to be blown away. I didnt see a movie I was transported by a story. I was instantly transcended into realizing why films should be made to begin with. I wasnt just entertained I was emotionally moved and intellectually bamboozled in the most endearing manner. If this film remains on IMDbs number one spot for a long time to come Its well deserves it. To me personally the Shawshank Redemption is a testament as to why the 90s were an interesting decade but more than that why a film can become an experience and gain instant classic status. There are two simple rules you should follow prior to watching T S R: one if you havent seen it dont let any one who HAS seen it tell you anything about its plot Dont listen to a word caus they might ruin it for you. Two make arrangements not to be interrupted when watching the film  The Two Towers doesnt match the opening movie or the climax and the best film of the decade. The Return of the King is mind blowing. Most seeing the movie know the plot as they have read Tolkeins mighty opus. But if you have missed the news Christopher Lees character doesnt appear. No Saruman. Make sense of it And Sarumans death at the hands or wraps of the worm in the book. Battle of Pelennor Fields is a masterwork. Far better than the battle scenes in Russel Crowes Robin Hood which I saw this week. Scott uses flesh and blood and a mass of special effects beats him off the screen created in this monster of a movie. The bearers of the ring make the miserable ascent to their final destination to dispose of it. Sauron being stuck as a giant burning eye the whole time sort of limits what he can do. Peter Jackson solves that with a dreamlike moment of Frodos final struggle. Peter Jackson is clearly a genius in his ability to allow actors to act and giving them space to do so. Lord of the Rings would have been so much lesser had he mashed the actors in special effects and monsters like George Lucas does. The biggest applause is for New Zealands landscape. It is the land of Lord of the Rings. positive,When I first saw pulp fiction I thought it was a kinda cool movie  violent but in a cool way Shocking but in a cool way I dont know how many times I have seen this film but I now see its so much more Its a rich intertextual film going experience Its a gangstar movie For lack of a stronger term its a black comedy Its a renegade boxer story Its Easy Rider Deliverance and Shaft Its a film noir its a melodrama Its romance and action Its narrative flow is not just novel but near genious If Tarantino was only allowed to be credited with one film in his amazing career this would definitely be the one positive,When I first rented Pulp Fiction out of the local Filmtown video store I didnt know what to think I just thought that three hours of talking who cares But when I saw the movie second timeI was completely blown away Bruce Willis as bad as he wants to be gives everything he got while playing the role of Butch He is frustrated angry scared and out of is mind at the same time Well who wouldnt be if he had a mob like Ving Rhames tryin to catch him John Travolta and Samuel Jackson is the most perfect on-screen duo ever seen Travolta a gentleman hoodlum tries to talk sense to Jackson who experienced a religious awakening during a normal payback assignment Uma Thurman plays her role like its in her blood She plays Mia Wallace a drug addict and mobs wife She kinda reminds me of Courtney love It is amazing how Quentin Tarantino can make a conversation about European fast food restaurants sound interesting Tarantino is genius I tell you genius A three-hour film full of dialogue sounds boring but this is anything but that Damn I shouldnt have written this Now I want to watch it againpositive,when guardians of the galaxy was announced many people didnt know who they wereme tooafter this thoi think everyone will know who they arethe story follows peter quill and how he mets the other guardians grootrocketgamoraand draxand their first mission togetherthe story was very good and fits great with the other marvel movies and what is comingthe humor plays very great even when theres dramathe acting was also great by everyoneeveryone fit there rolesthe villain ronan was okaynot as great as loki but he wasnt the worstevery guardian was so interestingyou feel like if they had there own solo movie it would be very interestingof course the character that stand out the most was rocketbradley cooper every joke by him was always on point and very funnyanother plus was the soundtrackevery song was just so goodit fit the story i think everyone can enjoy this movieit says its pg13 but do be careful if you bring your children because there is a lot of bad languagethere is a postcredit scence so stay for thatpositive,When Batman Begins was released in the year 2009 I watched it and wondered seeing the ending scene where the joker was revealed to be the villain in the next installment of the series that well how Christopher Nolan is gonna incorporate the funny playful and completely insane character of the Joker in to his dark and serious version of Batman.. So when I went to watch this movie I was ready to see the Heath Ledgers Joker cracking some jokes blowing up lots of places killing tons of people going way beyond insane and of course laughing a lot.. But the joker I saw was rather just the opposite. He did blow up buildings he did kill people he did go insane and laugh but he did all of this with a motive and a touch of control and calmness to it.. Its been a while since I have seen a movie where the villain shines more than the hero and in this movie Heath Ledgers Joker completely stole the show. Everything he does seems reasonable and the things that he says feels honest and true. The movie grips you throughout its 152min runtime. Christopher Nolan nailed it and showed how comic book characters can be taken out of their colorful world put them in a dark and serious movie and make it work.. Other actors also played their part well Christian Bale was good as Batman/Bruce Wayne Aaron Eckhart was brilliant as Harvey Dent Gary Oldman Maggie Gyllenhaal Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman played their roles beautifully. This movie is one of my favourite movies of all time For those of you who havent watched it yet I recommend you watch it as soon as possible because this kind of gems come rarely..positive,When a film series or trilogy receives as impeccable a treatment a J.R.R. Tolkiens Lord of the Rings its nearly impossible for its grand finale to falter. Such is the case of The Return of the King an absolutely colossal conclusion to Peter Jacksons epic vision. Considering a majority of Return of the King is payoff for being patient in the previous two chapters the film is the most fun of the three and the biggest crowd pleaser. If you loved the previous films you cant not love this one more. Its not necessarily that the film is better. Rather its so tonally and structurally consistent with the other films that by virtue of being the end it stands out as an incredible experience hence its winning of the Oscar for Best Picture. After the Battle of Helms Deep and the defeat of Isengard the armies of Mordor move on Gondor and the city of Minas Tirith. With King Theoden Bernard Hill of Rohan wary of giving all his muscle to the men of Gondor Gandalf Ian McKellen and Pippin Billy Boyd ride there to convince the steward of Gondor Denethor John Noble the mourning father of Boromir to extend his hand to Rohan and in effect to Aragorn Viggo Mortensen heir to the throne and rightful king of Gondor a title the ranger struggles with. The War of the Ring is something to behold even though its interrupted by Frodo Elijah Wood and Sams Sean Astin quest to cast the Ring back into the fires of Mt. Doom. Rather than having the forces of Sauron and the armies of Gondor and Rohan clash in a tense battle in which the victor remains unclear the story sets the battle up to have two extreme sides namely that we spend a majority of the battle scenes watching Minas Tirith get torn to pieces wondering how good can possibly triumph. On the other end we know that Gollum Andy Serkis has plans to betray Frodo and Sam in order to repossess his one and only Precious. The debate between the two hobbits on whether Gollum can be trusted reaches its zenith in a heartbreaking way seeing as we are aware of Gollums intentions and by this point with the Ring reaching Mordor it calls out for its master and consequently has a horrible effect on Frodo. The story pushes certain failure to the brink in both the War of the Ring and in Frodo and Sams quest to destroy the Ring and its easy enough to buy every ounce of it despite knowing it cant possibly end in a horrible way. Thats testament to the power of the storytelling going on here. How Return of the King really one ups The Two Towers is that it doesnt feel as though its bouncing around nearly as much between the different story lines even though it is. The momentum of the impending battle and Frodo and Sam inching closer and closer to Mt. Doom keep things on edge and driving forward at all times. No scene feels obligatory or like its stalling and even some creative scene juxtaposition such as Pippin singing to Denethor as Faramir charges into battle only makes the script appear even stronger. From an action and visual spectacle standpoint Return of the King completely outdoes the previous chapters. A battle sequence in which Legolas Orlando Bloom takes down an entire oliphant on his own sums up the quality of the film in the most basic entertainment sense. Even with all the doom and gloom theres still plenty of humor in this one as well. The resolution of the many subplots also helps to improve the overall quality of Two Towers in the context of the trilogy just by providing payoff to all the story lines that film built yet to which it gave no resolution. Everything that Eowyn Miranda Otto does in Two Towers feel for naught by the end of that film but she gets her shining moment in Return of the King that brings her character full circle. Return of the King works well on its own but it also proves that The Lord of the Rings was meant to be watched together as a trilogy as lots of small details in the first two films pay bigger dividends in the finale. Jackson certainly proved why the entire trilogy needed to be filmed together as a complete entitypositive,Whats fantastic about Tarantino is his ability to make films that are entertaining throughout He does this in part by having his characters discuss off subject things which really helps the characters and doesnt hinder performance in any way Hes absolutely fantastic at writing dialogue and it really adds to it Pulp Fiction feels vibrant Pulp Fiction feels alive And far from interminable it knows exactly what direction it going in It feels fresh and innovative due to the clever story structure that doesnt feel convoluted at all The story structure to me actually aids the ending and the film as a whole Incredibly clever stuff from Tarantino Over time Tarantino films have become more and more bloated but this and Reservoir dogs were perfectly restrained films To be both wild and restrained at the same time to me is an impressive feat Performance wise I think everyone here is on top form Its an interesting cast and a brave cast but it absolutely fits I enjoyed Willis more than usual as he seems more free and relaxed Travolta is handled very well which is something that I would have thought is very hard to do His characters need to be tongue in cheek and thats certainly the case here For me this is a film that can only really be done once Doing away with narrative structure in this way gives it a completely unique feel whilst still being compelling I think few could pull this off in fact I doubt even Tarantino could pull it off again For bravery creative spark unique tone awesome writing and pure entertainment value I cant not give this a ten Ten out of Tenpositive,what you get when you mix a james bond movie like 007 and matthew vaughns 2010 hit kickass? you get kingsman the secret service a wildly funny and pleasing action comedy starring colin firth and samuel l jackson this film is packed with everything a great action comedy needs amazing casting gut busting humor and a fantastic script kingsman is easily one of the best funniest comedies i have seen in recent years and contains some of the most clever oneliners especially from samuel l jackson it had my friends and i laughing almost constantly throughout the duration of the film taron egerton plays eggsy a young man in his late teens or early twenties who is called by harry galahad colin firth to join a top secret organization known as kingsman a corporation of spies there he must go through a grueling training to take down an evil villain richmond valentine who is bent taking over the world by using mind control chips on everyone around the world sound familiar? the funniest part about this how the chips causes people to engage into fist fights and kill each other which is shown in various scenes this movie is filled with insanely hilarious scenes such as colin firth beating the crap out of thugs with an umbrella and eggsy blowing up everyones heads into cartoonish explosions as well as the comedic chemistry from colin firth samuel l jackson and taron egerton if you are a big fan of kickass and kickass 2 this is a movie not worth missingpositive,What to say This trilogy sets up a totally new standard of filming and if anyone wants to compete with this piece of art surely have a big job to do. Cant tell you how much I enjoy watching these movies. Totally a new world visually very impressive acting at very high level to action keeps you entertained during the whole movie and watching these three movies makes you sad because they least only 11 hours . Cant have enough of these movies. Its been 11 years since I watched for the first time and I still feel hungry for them. I think that many years will pass until someone will make a better movie than LOTR and in my opinion for 50 years this trilogy will keep very high place on IMDb list because these movies are timeless.positive,What to say about the Shawshank Redemption I shouldnt really have to say anything because when most people hear about it they already have a pretty good idea of how incredible it is. This movie is freakin immaculate. Darabont and Co. have created not only the most inspiring film in ages but one of the most emotionally significant films to date. The movie teaches things to us that we need to know - messages on hope perseverance and friendship - and it does it with marvelous eloquency. All in all The Shawshank Redemption remains one of the most spectacular films I have ever seen - a master piece of art. Perfect.  the characters the dialogue the music the colors the crazy plot. I wish Tarantinos follow-up to Pulp Fiction had also been an ensemble piece but my guess is that he wanted to avoid being pegged as a certain kind of storyteller. In my book hes only one kind of storyteller: a great one. Outside of Short Cuts this is the best film Ive ever seen. 10 stars. positive,What Pulp Fiction does is not give you the normal rinky-dink Point-A to Point-B generic movie The film isnt about plot progression What Tarantino does in essence is create an entire world This is a vast interwoven interacting multi-varied facet of a criminal underworld in which we quickly find interest and empathy in vivid solid characters What this film conveys is a kind of charisma not only from each of these character but from the synergy they create as a whole that can make you feel like you have really stepped into their world into another life and accept this morally ambiguous modern-day epic Truly there has not been a more enriched and wholly enthralling film to have been released in the last decade if not longer And lastly on a personal level while I do not believe that this is the ultimate masterpiece of film history it is personally my favorite film and was the defining film that has lead me towards a career in the film industry So obviously it must have something going for itpositive,What is there to say about this movie except it is a triumph in film making. First of all anything narrated by Morgan Freeman you know is going to be a great movie. A story of a life behind bars with no end this ordinary man turns Shawshank prison up side down. I think the fact that this movie is so simple is also the reason it is so great. There is no complicated cinematic techniques or special effects just men talking to each other. Tim Robbins shows us that the good guys can win even when their livelihood has been taken away. Its the kind of movie that just makes you smile on the inside and lets you appreciate the simple things even if just for that day. The Shawshank Redemption is definitely a movie everyone should see only if just to brighten your day. But I think in the future it will prove to be an important mark in cinematic history.positive,What in the gods name was that my lord what a movie excellent brilliant nope this movie is more than that the characters the plot all was part of the plan what can i say about this kind of movie Bale Eckhart Ledger RIPCaine Freeman everybody every scene everything in this film is just .... i cant say a word which mean over the top and more thanks Mr Chris Nolan this what all the dark knight fans taking about this is the world of batman realistic apocalyptic im from Colombia so Que h. De p. pelicula tan buena. please WB do it again Mr Nolan deserves a high profit for his work also Mr Bale and Copositive,What i cant get is why i cant shout int the reviews :p okay on a more serious note The dark knight is one of the best superhero movie ever made if not the best movie Christopher Nolan has produced yet another near perfection movie The plot the story the lines the action everything was near perfect But the real reason of it reach this and Im not afraid to say this is HEATH LEDGER Heaths performance as the joker is what makes this movie perfect Christian Bale was Awesome as well. but let me assure you it is the joker that keeps you at the edge of your seat A Near perfect movie and an inspiring performance as the joker by heath Must watchpositive,What I can say is this is a really great movie. It tells use there exists brightness in the darkness and never gives up hope. You will succeed in the end. And also be ready at any time. Maybe it is because of language problem I dont grasp it very well in the beginning. But step by step I understand it. And in the end I understand it and especially the result is out of my expectation that doesnt happened in the movies I have ever seen in the past. And also the performance skill is another thing I like it. They are good actors. And this is the movies that seldom take man-women sensation as topic but still give people good feelings. Great movie encourage you while entertaining you  also for the perfect story. Peter Jackson has showed everybody that he can do the Lord Of The Rings from book to movie. I will also give some credits to the best writer ever: JRR Tolkien. He was in the beginning a ordinary teacher until he write a little sentence: Once upon a time there was a hobbit who lived in the Shire. This little hobbit was Bilbo Bagger. But back to the movie this is the best movie ever been made. Viggo Mortensen is fantastic as the role Aragorn. But dont he have more beard in the end of the film than in the beginning. But the actor that I think is the greatest in The Lord Of The Rings company is Sean Astin alias Samwise Gamgi. He make his performance so fantastic. The emotions is really coming forward here. I love the scene when Sam takes Frodo on his back to carry him the last steps in to the fires of mount doom: I cant carry it for you the ring... But I can carry you So finally I just want to say: This is the greatest movie in the modern history... positive,What has been said that hasnt been said before The story The characters The music The Special Effects The Visual Effects The CInematography The Source Material The Endings The plot in a nutshell: Frodo and Sam are on Mordors footsteps with the doubtful intentions of Gollum leading them. Meanwhile Sauron is angry at the Heir of Isildur and sets to attack Gondor. The greatest battle scene ever conceived and made takes place. But its not the end. The good guys win the battle but the war is still on. Frodo has been betrayed by Gollum and left to die with Shelob. He survives but unconscious and is taken right into Mordor by patrolling orcs. There after being rescued by Sam they set off to Mount Doom to destroy the Ring. But in order to distract Saurons eye from witnessing all of this Aragorn and company set a fight in front of the the imposing Black Gate. Theyre more than positive that they will lose. But Frodo fights and falls repeatedly until he gets right above the fire. When hes about to turn away as the Ring always manage to do Gollum appears and fights Frodo for it. Thankfully the once hobbit falls with the Ring in hand and both are melted in the lava. Mordor Sauron and the Orcs are destroyed. The good guys win. Aragorn is crowned but it is he who bows to the hobbits for their services were even greater then what anyone could have ever done. This is where you can turn off the TV stop the DVD or change the channel. The rest is just Frodo saying goodbye. My opinion I loved the movie Never in the history of film-making there will be a fantasy movie as original engaging universal and pure fun as The Lord of the Rings. Im not sure if Peter Jackson had in his mind that the movie would be the ultimate epic that it has become. This chapter is the best in the three. Yes the many endings drag but at least when I saw it in the Theater I didnt want it to end seriously. The  here goes all out. While it has the same dramatic touch from the previous it bigger in scope even the simplistic boy chant when Gollum contemplates the Ring for the last time is epic and ecstatic. I personally would have ended the movie with the final shot on Minas Tirith and a pan on the map of Middle Earth. A beautiful perfect scene. The Rosie Cotton loose end had to be tied up I think because people wouldnt think Sam and Frodo had more than friendship which due to the sociological contamination of the media is rather ambiguous. But even as it has some drawbacks these arent enough to take away any stars from this pictures rating. It has made history and it has become the Star Wars for a new generation not even the prequels could imitate the impact this new trilogy had. Best fantasy movie EVER This is not a naive statement that will pass on whenever another fantasy movie is made. Its for real. You can just feel astonished. How can a movie be that great  Audio/sound: 10/10 Return of the King deserves much praise for its auditory work making the viewer really enjoy this movie. Audio/music is a very important part of a movie and this movie certainly reaches sky-high on that level. Every bit of music and sound mixing fits extremely well with the scenes in which they have been placed. Editing: 10/10 With a very few exceptions the editing done for RotK is close to flawless. It does not get confusing to watch neither is it boring or slowed down at any time. The pace is done with the mind of a perfectionist. You are kept on your toes throughout the movie. Visual Effects: 10/10 Although not completely perfect there is not any moment of bad effects which would have made many disappointed. They are in fact extremely well done and deserve 10/10. Screenplay: 10/10 The screenplay writers deserves extremely much praise for what has been achieved. When watching the movie everything seemed to fit perfectly well. Screenplay is a very important part of any movie and in comparison to RotK no movie I have ever watched comes close to it. Directing: 10/10 Peter Jackson is a perfectionist and he boldly takes on one of the hardest directing jobs possible and he succeeds The LotR-trilogy is beyond doubt the best that has ever been made and RotK is its crowning masterpiece. Acting performances: 10/10 There is no best acting ensemble but there is best performances by an acting ensemble and in RotK everyone does a truly amazing job. There is a harmony in the ensemble and all are clearly doing the best that they can. Every actor glows in the scenes which they are a part of and makes the movie ever so much more enjoyable. 10/10 Art design: 10/10 Every detail from minor to major is done to perfection. We really get a feel that this is Middle-earth which is not by any means an easy job. In this movie this remains one of the most important aspects and is done beautifully. Costume designs: 10/10 As with the art design this is also done to perfection. We really see Middle-earth and with very much thanks to the clothing and costumes. Make-up/Hair: 10/10 This too plays an important role and is of course extremely well done. From the beautiful elf to the ugly orc all is congruent and we believe what we see to be Middle-earth. Summary: What we have here is a movie that is done with careful perfection and a loving heart and with the utmost respect for the novel by J.R.R. Tolkien. The achievements of every part of the movie is undeniably close to perfection and what we are left with is a stunning experience that will leave marks on anyone seeing it. It is no exaggeration to call this movie the greatest of all time and the evidence is there for all of us to see. You dont have to enjoy the story to see that what is created is a masterpiece of movie-making. This is the only movie I have seen that deserves a 10/10 overall and I am in fact surprised that it is not above all others at the top-list of IMDb. But on top of the list or not this IS the best work ever done in the motion picture market and has made movie-making into an art positive,what do you get if you take all the garbage out of the low budget movies and glue it all together yep you guessed it - Pulp Fiction the ultimate movie of my generation. one could call it the bible for film freaks. if you didnt see it yet read no more just go and buy it or rent it whatever. and if you dont like it go see it again and again if necessary.positive,What can i say...The only film to make a grown man cry No film comes close to this in any way or formit draws you in from the start-keeps you there and if your like me..turns you to tears at the very last scene.Enjoy it because no film will ever be made like this again.  and though I like Reservoir Dogs more Pulp Fiction is not too far away of being as great as that. And I must say too that Pulp Fiction should have won the Oscar that year instead of Forrest Gump. positive,What can I say.. This was the Best Batman movie Ever.. what performances The details in this movie were superb. Coming from an audio background myself the detail in the sounds design and post-production was incredible. I can only imagine the amount of tracks necessary to create the effects and Foley. My hats off to all the CGI folks. I really look forward to great graphics and they did just that. For those that have been watching Batman movies for decades the Villain played by Mr. Ledger will make you tremble with fear. The way he truly developed and embraced this character is unreal.. He became the joker. I always having a saying.. You are good as your last work Its a shame it was his last. This movie is one to buy and keep as a collectible. Go get itpositive,What can i say this is perfect See it twice or more Every time you watch it you will discover new fancy details in the picture or hear a new line that somehow wasnt there the first time Thats all there is to be said about that Enjoy the perfect movie  in another story he is with his partner Jules Winnfield Samuel L Jackson trying to transmit a message to a group of guys who owns money to Marcellus Wallace  in another story he only makes an appearance in which is actually the story of Butch Coolidge Bruce Willis a fighter who works Marcellus Wallace which after a fight which was supposed to lose he tries to flee the country with his French girlfriend Fabienne Maria de Medeiros Many other characters form the movie mixing in stories each one with a different theme but all have something alike long dialogs The film features unprecedented writing addresses several topics some do not have anything to do with the stories and the situations of the characters but the way they are written in a way so simple and interesting is really from a true master on writing screenplays that is Quentin Tarantino Despite having had help from Roger Avary on the screenplay this time but all the ideas are still from Tarantinos mind keeping his good dark-humor and his bloody fun violence The film with so many stories Tarantino mixes the different chapters leaving them out of order Not to leave more confused but to leave the film more entertaining and extremely interesting with the insane dialogs between characters A legendary film excellent performances perfect writing with interesting stories covering various topics and all very entertaining Undoubtedly the best Tarantino film a classic and a legendary masterpiecepositive,What can I say Quentin Tarantino changed something in movies And this and Resoirvor Dogs was the ones that put him on the map Now I must say this is a harsh movie it shows stuff thats rarely shown in films it is also realistic and heck even funny at times This is a good definition of a good film Its well made its well written and its provocative Its not the kind of film you turn on on a Saturday night for some fun but if you like film you must watch this But I warn you its R rated for a reason I guess the expression can you handle the real world really makes sense in this movie So if your a film buff and you havent seen this what are you waiting for I give this film a 10/10positive,What can i say its shaw shank. I dont refer the film as the shaw shank redemption i call it shaw shank as everyone knows what Im on about when i say its my favourite and i only seen it in April 2012. The story is well known as Andy dufrense is wrongly accused of a double murder and sentenced to shaw shank prison where he meets red played by the awesome Morgan freeman. Over time in the movie he adapts to life in prison and escapes and becomes a free man. How did a movie this so simple become beloved by so many. How I dont know how and i dont care but this film is basically a beginner for any filmmaker and already became a success years later. Although it did not great at the box office yet critics praised it well years later people discovered it on VHS. I wished i seen this film earlier as a teenager as it would have struck to me even more through a time i felt depressed and sad. A discovered this movie in the local library and rented it as i heard of the film being very good and after seeing it it is more than just good. I may be over-exaggerating this brilliance of the film but it unlike many other films except the lion king of the return of the king hit me right in the soft spot. I didnt cry at the end i smiled at the end. What a film. The good of the film the acting from freeman. Although he lost to hanks in Forrest gump for best actor i donpositive,What can I say about this movie that hasnt already been said It proves that good acting writing editing and a kick-ass soundtrack are the perfect ingredients to make a superb and refreshing film Its just one of those films you can watch over and over and never get bored with it From the memorable dialogue to the unique and impressionable characters  this movie has it all If you love a movie that energizes all of your senses then check this one out This truly is American film making at its finest positive,What can I say about this movie I think anyone who watch the movie can say the same cause theres only one word to define this movie: Perfection. Maybe everybody wont think that but remember: Perfection is different for each one of us...positive,What can I add to all the other reviews here Just my own feelings about this. I now realise I watched the film in one of the hardest times emotionally I can remember in my life. Thoughts chasing themselves around in my head heartbroken paranoid and not well physically. Total mess. My dear female friend who got me through it all told me this was a film to watch. I initially resisted thinking it was going to be lightweight PC fare. I dont know why I thought that. Theres a lacklustre opening sequence -I think. Then you get to see what kind of performance Morgan Freeman is going to turn out this time and you start to be interested. Then this extraordinary scene flying over the prison and I think by then youre hooked. This scene is deeply moving not least because of the music. Its difficult to see how Thomas Newmans music for this film could possibly be bettered - perfectly listenable to in its own right but when you do youre reminded of the boys on the roof in the sun enjoying their first beer for so long. Theyve been touched by Andys kindness. Sometimes a kindness is thrown back in ones face but other times a gesture of gratitude is given back - like Haywood getting up and offering Andy one of his beers - and a powerful connection is made. The film is full of great hardships and unbearable sadness - surely scars that can never completely heal or be forgotten. But it is also full of joy and fun and hope. To capture all the above in a film is a triumph. I started watching the film fairly closed to feeling but as I watched the end I could not contain my tears unusually. So a moment when a film came along at the right time for me and no doubt for many otherspositive,what a narration..One of my all time favorites. Shawshank Redemption is a very moving story about hope and the power of friendship. The cast is first rate with everyone giving a great performance. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman carry the movie but Bob Gunton and Clancy Brown are perfect as the Warden Norton and prison guard captain Hadley respectively. And James Whitmores portrayal of an elderly inmate Brooks is moving. The screenplay gives almost every actor at least one or more memorable lines through out the film. As well as a very surprising twist near the end that almost knocked me out of my chair.positive,What a Movie What an end to a simply superb Trilogy Take a bow Peter Jackson. The Return of The King is all what you expect in a movie Brilliant story brilliant acting brilliant scenic locations brilliant war sequences and a brilliant ending. It is a visual treat even for the blind. The story starts or rather continues with Frodo Sam and Sjmeagol continuing on their journey towards and into Mordor for the ultimate purpose of destroying Saurons One Ring while Aragorn and company fight it out to protect Minas Tirith along with the help of Rohan. The sheer magnitude of some scenes takes you by surprise Such is the scale of this project and Jackson executes it to perfection. The landscapes are gigantic the scenes are breath-taking especially the lighting of the beacons. Inspiring to say the least The performance of Viggo Mortensen as Aragorn is perfect. When he says For Frodo and My friends you bow to no one it sounds so classy simple and yet so sublime. And what follows is a speechless moment of vigor determination and hope and trust. Sean Astin as Samwise Gamgee steals the show towards the end. His performance was nothing short of authentic and complete. His loyalty and friendship towards Frodo is depicted beautifully with lovely dialogs and sequences. Special appreciation also to the creation of Sjmeagol the creature who seeks The Ring. His character has been aptly shown on the screen and one can only admire the lengths of effort put in. All in all The Return of The King is a success. It is much more than just a movie. It has been a revolution of visual cinema in a way that has inspired many fantasy books and movies from the era of J.R.R. Tolkein. The film is complete with the battle at Minas Tirith one of the best movie scenes ever to be made. It is long a joy to watch and a bigger enjoyment to watch again. The background  is splendid especially towards the end when Frodo nearly reaches the foothills of Mount Doom and proceeds towards the depths along with Sam. This movie will move many hearts and win even more. Very few movies of this caliber come and go every year let alone a decade and to miss this saga would be a fools idea. Without any hesitation a supreme 10 / 10.positive,What a movie I have never seen a movie like this one. I have never been so confused or amused like this before. This movie has everything. So many great moments. I enjoyed this movie the first time I saw it and every time I watch it.positive,what a great live action version of the classic fairytale this was a great reminder of the good old innocent days back then when people were not so cynic and faced things with open heart a great retelling full of strong emotions and a great message that if u are kind and u believe u can win the battle of life on the plus side the movie also had a great soudtrack so get the dvd when its out plus the cd soundtrack lily james was the second best cinderella candidate after kimberly matula and since kimberly was not given the role then lily was the next perfect choice all in all a great fairytale for the new generation and for the adults to remember their past innocent childhood days dont miss this movieit will make yourelive the old dayspositive,What a great experience. This movie capped off a 3-year journey for me - one that included my first time reading the books including The Hobbit and The Silmarillion and several viewings of the movies. Each movie holds a special place in my heart but I think that this last one is the most satisfying. Ill forever remember the beacons being lit and Pippens sorrow-filled song. Probably the most poignant moment though is Gollums look as he gets to hold the ring one last time... and then the Eagles coming... As a whole I feel Ive accomplished something coming out of this experience. Id like to thank the movie-makers for this experience... for it truly has been fulfilling and life changing.positive,what a good movie do not watch this movies trailer do not research and read anything about it just watch it empty line placeholders below as a minimum of 10 lines is required for a review silly now i need more lines for this review #1 now i need more lines for this review #2 now i need more lines for this review #3 now i need more lines for this review #4 now i need more lines for this review #5 now i need more lines for this review #6 now i need more lines for this review #7 now i need more lines for this review #8 now i need more lines for this review #9 now i need more lines for this review #10 now i need more lines for this review #11 now i need more lines for this review #12 now i need more lines for this review #13positive,What a complete masterpiece this film is from the first line spoken to the zoom-out in the end. The actors are all great but Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins really do outstanding performances. This is probably my all time favorite film and to anyone who hasnt seen it theres only one thing I can say: Please do You wont be disappointed.positive,Weve been subjected to enormous amounts of hype and marketing for the Dark Knight. Weve seen Joker scavenger hunts and one of the largest viral campaigns in advertising history and it culminates with the actual release of the movie. Everything thats been said is pretty much spot on. This is the first time I can remember where a summer blockbuster film far surpasses the hype. For as much action as there is in this movie its the acting that makes it a great piece of work. Between all the punches explosions and stunt-work is some great dialog work. All the actors have their moments. Bales Batman is the definitive Batman because we see everything in this character finally on film. Martial arts skills cunning great tactical thinking forensic application technological genius to advance or improve Luscious Foxs inventions/technological breakthroughs intimidating personality and even a little swashbuckling. As for Heath yes he gets credit for his performance as the Joker. But you have to also recognize Jonathan and Chris Nolan for the writing and treatment of the character. Its not just the fact that Ledger makes the Joker so menacing but the Nolans have given the character this great manifesto that drives its actions. The Jokers stance on chaos order anarchy the morality of the average modern human being make the character so interesting psychologically. The Nolans drafted a complex character and only a perfect performance couldve pulled something like this off. Thats how difficult of a role this was and thats why Ledgers performance is so great. This isnt an action movie. Its a film that explores literary themes of the hero and villain as well as order and anarchy. Yes listen to the dialog because its all in there.positive,were still pioneers weve barely begun our greatest accomplishments cannot be behind us because our destiny lies above us mankind has finally used up all of earths resources and it has become a dying planet when cooper mcconaughey and his daughter stumble upon a secret outpost that contains the remnants of nasa they are told of the seriousness of the problem facing humanity cooper is a former astronaut and is given the responsibility of traveling into space to find a habitable planet for the human race i have been writing these little reviews for almost 5 years now and for the most part i have found it easy to talk about every movie this one i cant seem to find the right words for the reason has less to do with my vocabulary and more to do with the awesomeness of the movie there are some movies that words just cannot do justice to the last one i felt that way about was the passion of the christ this is a movie you want to tell everyone about but no matter what you say its just not enough i loved gravity and this was 1000 times better overall really nothing i can say about this movie other than watch it christopher nolan is a genius i easily give this an a+positive,Well...Lets Just say im 12 years old...the first time i watched it i was 7 now i still watch it every single day. NoT many words can describe Lord of the Rings some of them maybe Mesmerising Unbeilevable...But for me it was pro bely the most Effecting movie i have ever witnessed. When i watch it i always get goosebumps...ALWAYS never once have i not been star struck by it. Now to all of you Tolkien Haters out there who call LOTR nerdy lets just say F*** YOU Now honestly i recommend these movies to pretty much everyone. Now I admit that there are too many endings6 to be precise but who honestly gives if you spend 5 years of your life loving this movie intensely no matter how many endings it has they will all make you cry.positive,Well what can I say. This makes Batman Begins seem terrible. Christian Bales Batman/Bruce Wayne is on top form and better than everEspecially with the scene involving the jump off the IFS in Hong Kong. I would hugely recommend that you watch this film. Ive seen hundreds of films and in my opinion this is the best of them all. Heath Ledgers Joker was fantastic. He brought humour and action to the whole film. I must say that Ledgers Joker has to be better than Nicholsons 1989 portrayal however the jokes were not of the same calibre. Anyway this film had it all - the action - the jokes. The storyline was great. It showed the jokers rise to power and it had plenty of action to help. Especially with the Party Crash scene the street scene where the tumbler explodes : But there is a surprise at this point and when Gotham General hospital has some structural re-modifications  Gets blown up. The ending lacked a bit of fight from both batman and the joker and both should have suffered a few more cuts and bruises. Anyway the whole film was brilliant and a must see for all movie lovers. Absolutely brilliant film that balances -suspense- action - laughter and adventure. Absolutely brilliant just like the cast and the director. What more can I saypositive,Well what can I say but Freeman who is simply a great actor a man who has never struck a false note in his career both narrates this tale and anchors it with his authoritative playing. Powerful poignant thought-provoking and finally irresistibly uplifting. The Shawshank Redemption works not only as an excellent prison drama but as a metaphor for overcoming our own private prisons.An amazing movie. Easily one of the best movies made during the 90s and definitely one of the top prison movies of all-time. Pretty much everything about this movie works and works extremely well I have not read Stephen Kings novella his first non-horror but some of the movies deficiencies such as the old-fashioned morality tale and portentous message about camaraderie and redemption--must have been in the source material.positive,Well this film in my opinion is possibly the best ever. This is the end of the Lord of the rings trilogy so it is a sad experience at the end but this film is absolutely epically epic. This film leads where the Two Towers left off with the Evil powers gaining strength for the final conclusion against all men while FrodoSam and Gollum head to Mordor. Everything is ten times bigger in thee stakes and importance as this film really plays up the fact that this trilogy is based throughout a year of these characters life and failure is not an option. Every character is better then they were in the last film even the lesser characters of people from Rohan and Gondor are acted magnificently and really live up to the expectations of this film. There isnt much more to say about this film but SEE IT as it is the most epic master class of film ever with great cinematography action drama and action. A film for the ages.positive,well the summary explains all its one of the only movies if not the only movie that kept me 100% exited from the first to the last minute well they saved the best for last best story book and best acting directing... I recommend it to every person its a CLASSIC that will always be remembered as one of the best and for me its the best movie observed by my eyesfinally I have seen a movie that is so much better than Titanicwell the summary explains all its one of the only movies if not the only movie that kept me 100% exited from the first to the last minute well they saved the best for last best story book and best acting directing... I recommend it to every person its a CLASSIC that will always be remembered as one of the best and for me its the best movie observed by my eyespositive,Well let me start off by saying I felt compelled to write this review to spite the numerous people who give it a 1 out of 10 because they feel it should be lower then a 9.3 and go on to write what they really think to you people I write this: you should vote it according to what you think the movie should be i.e. if you think the movie deserves an 8 out of 10 then you should vote as such I think this movie deserves a 10 out of 10 and so I have given it as such. As for the movie I cant tell you how incredible it is in my opinion it is the only movie to date I could watch again and again and not get tired of watching it the cast was spot on everything was perfect the subjugation of the prisons by Captain Hadley all of it was simply spot on honestly speaking I dont know how people could watch this and fail to see how truly amazing it is well deserving of its number 1 spot on IMDb. Also I read that people dont understand how Andy pinned the pictures to his wall it could be either celotape or bluetac and as you see during the movie Andy works from under the poster when digging his hole so there is no plot hole of how he put the poster back up after entering the hole because the poster never gets taken down.positive,Well in the LOTR book the noble elves never had those pinpointed ears and the death of Saruman was not like a deleted scene in the DVD version and then there was not the feat of Legolas of killing an elephant so easily and then Sam never held Frodo hanging on a cliffŠ—_ There are many points of bitter criticism of the film and many are true. But do they ever undermine the sheer pleasure of watching and watching again this feast of the film No they will never do. The siege of Minas Tirith is great and tragically realistic every new time. The final battle near Mordor is epic regardless how many times you saw that. The brilliant array of talents of Weaving Mortensen Wood Tyler Serkis Urban Wenham Astin or any other is never vapid or losing taste. The film has stood the test of time and any time you see the Sauron fall you feel elation pride joy and great triumph. The Good has won again and even with so many tragic deaths and losses and ruins it will reign for ever and ever. The final scene of the film with the parting of Bilbo and Frodo together with the great elves and Gandalf will always make us cry and the final song will make us breathe deep and swallow tears for this is a noble sorrow and noble sorrow this film has to awake in us. Many films may be made on the eternal novel of Mr. Tolkien but this epic will stand in our memory eternally. The road goes ever on.positive,well if you read the title this is what all this review about this movie about a writer who creates a story to punish her husband and everybody believe it but the reality that the writer of the movie is the one who cheated everybody by taking an old story and republish it fixing all the problems and weakness of it throwing the original into trash i watch tons of movies but im not that kind who always write a review about it the creators of this movie make me wanna write a review about it and even read the book after that its a really shocking reality when both husband and wife are victims and guilty at the same time and this is what life all about but does the punishment was fair or was it too much  this is what you going to decide after you watch this great story positive,Well I guess Im a little late to the party as far as writing down a review for this picture. Ive seen it a couple of times but that was before I became a regular contributor to the IMDb. When I first discovered this site a few years ago The Godfather was in the Number #1 spot and since then the films have traded places for first and second with Shawshank maintaining the top spot most of the time. That puzzled me a bit until I watched it again tonight and Ive come away from the picture with a new found appreciation. My favorite movies tend to be the story of underdogs in some way shape or form and my personal Top Ten list includes titles like On The Waterfront To Kill a Mockingbird and One Flew Over the Cuckoos Nest. I may have to reconsider that list an infrequent exercise but one I dont mind doing every now and then as situations warrant. Overall the film is darn near perfect. I know its pretty clich’© to state it that way but when you analyze the dialog the characters the directing and the tone of the movie the picture flows flawlessly even when it detours into side stories like Brooks Hatlens release and new prisoner Tommys introduction late in the picture. Every set-up every nuance has some importance that eventually converges to symbolize Andys quest for escape and personal redemption. Remember Brooks feeding Jake for the first time and eventually setting him free when he receives his own pardon How about Andy playing Mozart into the prison yard while settling back with a smile of contentment on his face. The story transcends one mans confinement for a crime he didnt commit and focuses instead on his reaction to circumstances beyond his control. Paul Newman showed us a different way to react to those kinds of conditions in 1967s Cool Hand Luke but his method was self destructive. Andy Dufresne Tim Robbins never loses his ability to keep his eye on the prize even if it takes him a couple of decades to do so. But even more so you have here the story of Ellis Boyd Redding Morgan Freeman a convict who sees Andy as a person and over time an inspiration to himself and the rest of the prisoners who call him friend. From Andy he comes to understand that even as a prisoner a man can live life on his own terms if he can keep his mind uncluttered by thoughts of desperation and hopelessness. Not bad for a convict who started out believing that hope can drive a man insane. I really cant recommend this picture highly enough both for its masterful story telling and its technical execution. The actors even those portraying the most minor characters were seemingly born for their roles. They deliver a seamless performance thats virtually unmatched by most modern films in a picture that hits all the right notes with an inspiring message of discipline and perseverance.positive,Well I didnt had any high expectations when i watched this movie but damnThis is one hell of a movieThis movie is very well safe in my top 5 favorite movie of all time As far as i remember this is the only movie that i didnt want it to end even when the duration is almost 3 hours This movie maybe didnt have much action or explosion but the dialogues are enough to keep you glued Seriously i think that is what Hollywood movies are lacking nowadayssuch entertaining and wonderful dialogues/conversation All of the cast did a great job in this movie And i think the one that really stand out is Sam Jackson And i think you all know why when you watch it And i pretty much enjoy the non- linear plot style that is shown in this movie I feel pity for anyone who still havent watch this movie or anyone who considered this movie as boringI remember when its about to end i was like Nooo dont end yetSuch an addicting movieA great masterpiece that will live throughout the agespositive,Well here it is one of the most anticipated movies of the year so far. How was it It was excellent. By far the best Batman film ever made and of course it will be one of the most memorable action films for a long while. Everyone was waiting to see how well Heath Ledger performed as The Joker in this film. He definitely deserves an Oscar in his honor. The character was so dark and creepy that it sent chills up my back. Compared to Heaths other films like 10 Things I Hate About You and even Brokeback Mountain proves that this man could actually act doesnt matter what character he could do it. The films storyline has many twists and all are rewarding the story is developed constantly after each scene making you wonder whats next. Excellent craft and flows well towards the conclusion. During the film on the scene with Batman against the Joker Bike vs Truck. People thought this was the ending. No it kept going which was awesome the story kept getting darker and darker I guess thats why they called it the Dark Knight as well as the relation to Batman himself. The cast was great. With Christopher Nolan playing Batman good performance Heath Ledger played extremely well Maggie was annoying at times but still deserves to be praised. Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman had minor roles which satisfied the audiences. Aaron Eckhart starts with a minor role which slowly progresses and becomes evil which is quite surprising and entertaining to watch. Great directing made the movie enjoyable they added more action this time which made the film feel powerful lighting was done well especially showing Harvey/ Two Faces face in the many moods he displayed. Great explosions made it entertaining. Made you feel great that this is finally the best action to come in a long time. This movie deserves a 10/10 rating and credit on behalf of the great young actor Heath Ledgers life. May he R.I.P His performance made what this film is right now. I recommend this film for any action fan especially a Batman fan. Or if your even a Heath Ledger fan. Go ahead right now and see this film. Its greatpositive,well folks thats how its done ever thought mi6 note thats what the british call their secret service is a club for snobbish upper class dudes who like to watch paint dry all they long? ok bond is kind of cool i hated the last two though but now we finally got a film that takes spy movies to the next level not since district 9 have i had that feeling during the watching of a film like this movie just does everything right by which i mean of course it plays exactly to my taste compared to this film every james bond movie released after licence to kill looks like a snorefest this is such a kickass balls against the wall crazy ride that i had to shake my head several times in disbelief during the screening i was invited to and i actually knew what i was in for ive seen every film by matthew vaughn but i was not prepared how far he was willing to go with this one thought kickass was pretty crazy? wait till you see this one of the key ingredients is the casting of the actors the well known stars all play against type which makes this even more unreal remember that lame dude who mainly played lame dudes in girlie movies like bridget jones? he just won an oscar for playing the stuttering king of england and as you will see in kingsman that oscar was well deserved that dude colin firth can play anything hes more badass in this than bond ever was a word to the wise though this film is not for the easily offended or the squeamish it is a comedy but a very very violent kind of comedy and the language alone will shock the mpaa out of their pants watch this if youre into films like lock stock kickass or in bruges and youll probably love it  dont bother if youre more into serious films or family friendly comedies as for me i had a bloody good timepositive,Well directed well produced love the photography and the script is amazing Quentin Tarantino is one of my preferred directors and the Pulp Fiction was the first film from Tarantino that made me start looking different for this directors work The arc of this script is super well created once the story connects all the scenes and characters in an order which makes you get into the movie The photography of this movie is also amazing very well planned in a way which brings all the atmosphere of the entire movie The characters are amazing super well acted by this super list of cast About Tarantinos direction there nothing that I can tell  in my opinion this guy is a genius with enough sensibility to put the audience on the right climax at the right moment One of the best movies I have ever seenpositive,Well as the other more than 2000 review say it in my opinion this is the best movie created so far. It basically just how life is: you get punched in a face time to time but you have to stand up keep your hope and give value to your fellows because in return life takes care about your reward. Oh yes and if you face any evil that you can stop do it. This is the message of the film if we follow it life may be as rewarding ultimately for us as for the hero. Other films that moved me like this: Forrest Gump The curious case of Benjamin Button. IMDb says I have to write another line in order for them to post my review so here it is xDpositive,Weary beyond words Hobbit companions Frodo and Sam continue their journey to destroy the One Ring with the sinister Gollum still their guide. The film opens interestingly with Gollums origin story capturing his descent into depravity and madness finding the ring in much the same manner in which he lost it. The ring has the power to affect its bearer and not for good. With the battle of Helms Deep over and Sarumans power gone the attention focuses on the capital of Gondor Minas Tirith. There the race of men must make a last stand before the growing might of an unseen enemy while those visible are more of a threat than ever. The Return of the King in its way is as much Aragorns story as it is Frodospositive,We have all see movies comedies action and dramas. We all liked ones hated others got into some other even and felt like part of it. In Shawshank Redemption  The French New Wave or blaxploitation The Wild Bunch or The Brady Bunch its all grist. positive,We are in an age where the audience can choose to view a film featuring 3-DC.G.I. and Special effects. The audience may also choose to find a film which has a solid story line a remarkable plot and surprises in an unpredictable series of events. But you cant have both. This is the general rule...However with the exception of The Dark Knight and only a few others All of these effects seem to be necessary to attain this culmination of an A+ Plot Direction Acting and Production. Definitely in my top 3 list of all time favorites. Thank You to everyone who was able to make this film what it is. One thing that makes this film special is its unique ability to stand alone as a solid film without ever seeing the prequel or sequel.positive,We all remember how good Batman Begins was right Well after seeing the much anticipated and hyped sequel Begins is childs play. Good evening ladies and gentlemen. Were tonights entertainment... The action kicks off with a bank heist that brings back memories of Michael Manns excellent Heat a feeling that lingered for the entire movie and more-or-less introduces us to The Joker. Now believe me when I say that The Joker is completely mental. Heath Ledgers performance is brilliant. Theres talk of an Oscar nomination something which is very much deserved. He completely disappears into his character perfecting the best screen villain since Hannibal Lecter. Just check out the scene with the pencil... The Joker prefers the slow kill. He is tortured by his sinister smile and when you hear how he got it it will send shivers down your spine. But the thing that is truly sinister about him is hes not into crime for the money. The Joker kills and stirs the pot-because he can. This city deserves a better class of criminal... and Im gonna give it to them With praise for The Joker out of the way its time to acknowledge the other key players in this epic crime thriller. Morgan Freeman manages to put a new twist on his never-ending good guy roles he was God once for Christs sake Maggie Gyllenhaal is the perfect replacement for the bland Katie Holmes as Batmans long time friend and love interest Rachel Dawes Nestor Carbonell of Lost fame nails the Gotham City Mayor and the awesome Michael Caine is you guessed it awesome as Batmans trusty butler Alfred. Another interesting point of this movie is we get insight into all of these characters even Alfred whos often just a plot device in previous Batman movies. The night is darkest just before the dawn. And I promise you the dawn is coming... Following the opening heist we see everyones favourite troubled millionaire Bruce Wayne Christian Bale cinemas definitive Batman in his Bat-Suit once again cleaning the streets of Gotham before getting the news from his close friend and clean cop James Gordon Gary Oldman reprising his rare good guy role from Begins that it would be wise to work with the citys District Attourney Harvey Dent Aaron Eckhart perfectly cast in their attempts to clean the streets of criminals. This begins a series of events that brings Batman to the attention of The Joker who then plots to kill him in order to maintain criminal status of Gotham first targeting various authority figures including the Mayor and Dent. So what are you proposing Its simple: kill The Batman... To say much more about the plot would weaken the experience of the film but there is one other key point of this film and that is the dramatic rise and fall of Harvey Dent and his painfully emotional and physical transformation into Harvey Two-Face... You either die a hero or you live long enough to see yourself become the villain... All in all this film is perfectly written there are action scenes a-plenty but they dont interfere with the extraordinary character development contains brilliant performances all round especially the power-house performance by Heath Ledger directed with confidence and gusto by Christopher Nolan and is darkly funny for the most part but takes itself very seriously when it comes to the drama. Know your limits Master Wayne. Batman has no limits. The verdict: The Dark Knight is stunning. It will be regarded as one of the best movies of the noughties if not all time. It twists the standard comic-book formula and sets the standards of every comic-book and crime-thriller movie yet to be made. In a word: perfect.positive,Watching this movie was a pleasure the acting was outrageously good. A film without special effects and action every 5 minutes just men in prison. All I can say is I would have loved this film to have been longer. The acting from Morgan Freeman is second to none he proves in this film why he is regarded as one of the greatest actors to grace our screens. Anyone who hasnt seen this film needs too watch it straight after reading this review as it will change your opinion on a lot of other films.positive,Watching this great movie for the second time I remember some of the best times I had as a moviegoer especially as a kid. I remember watching the original Star Wars series with a SERIOUS amount of amazement. Raiders of the Lost Arc gave me a great sense of adventure. And the first Jaws scared the hell out of me. All these movies and others like them PROVIDED something for me to remember. In addition they were just plain FUN movies. Not pretentious overwrought or just plain dumb. Most of todays movies are just plain nonsense. They have no heart like they used to. They are all made for the sole purpose of making a buck. Although I am sure that New Line Cinema would love to make billions on this series and Peter Jackson and his people are being paid well for their efforts that does not prevent these movies from being great works of art and just plain fun. I remember reading these books as a kid and I have always loved them and wanted somebody to do a proper adaptation of them. Now that the final book has been brought to the big screen we can see the entire series from a new perspective and I for one admire it more than I ever have. It would have been easy for Jackson and co. after the success of Fellowship to just give people a shortened version of the last two books with teasers here and there but no substance. But he has not done this. Return of the King is the best example of this. In this movie Jackson has made a movie that works very well with the books and finds the most essential parts of it to make a movie that works on just about every level. From the scenery in New Zealand to the look of the battles I felt as if I WAS there to the incomparable computer effects of Gollum and the equally amazing effects of Shelob ever part was filmed with a care to the details that the books deserved. The dialog in this movie is also much better than in Two Towers. I loved this movie from the first scene of how Smeagol finds the ring of power to the last frame of Sam closing his door in the Shire. Back to what I was saying at the top. Very few movies today give me a sense of wonder that I had as a kid. This series certainly does this. From the beginning to the end the movies are a stunning achievement and worthy of any awards it receives.positive,watch it right now because of the great acting by the leads watch it right now because of the awesome plot watch it right now because of the feeling it leaves you with you feel terrible and cheated upon watch it right now because of the ending watch it right now because of the mystery that fills the air and clouds your brain while you are watching it watch it right now so that you know how crazy can girls get and yours isnt half as crazy watch it right now because i have given you enough reasons as to why you should just watch it right now warning contains adult scenes it may disturb childrenpositive,watch 10 movies before you die and you are at right place all the characters are beautifully executed in the movie specially Ving Rhames has done an amazing job while Bruce Willis was outstanding no doubt John Travolta and Samuel Jackson beautifully played their characters Uma Thurman was at her best Tim Roth was very good at his small character this movie is totally memorable all the characters were like alive even a small role of zed was noticeable music was amazing to listen and it even brought John Travolta dancing last but not least Quintin Tarantino was there to witness about the beauty of the moviepositive,Was a great Movie  I love the story and the actors were fantastic. There is so much to say about this movie. But look seriously look and say it is not a great movie from beginning to end. Of course a good soundtrack also makes a great movie so the soundtrack also has to be mentioned. The Movie Picture is very good. good angles of shooting always transmitting us the space inside the prison. or rather the space that we have not. And finally check out this great movie. they repented and were left with a better perspective for life. See the movie enjoy and learn To finish just saying that it as a great movie oh wait i already said that no problem its to highlight the idea.positive,WARNING: MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS Im glad youre here Sam here at the end of all things I found that this particular line near the conclusion of the film struck a note inside me. Not only as one of my favorite lines from Tolkiens work but also as a sad reminder that the trilogy has drawn to a close. No more will the rush of anticipation fill me as another December approaches heralding the arrival of another of Peter Jacksons masterworks. The most monumental of the three films The Return of the King also evokes the strongest impact within me. It represents the culmination of years of the most careful work that brought one of the most epic stories into cinema history. Ill begin with the obvious strong points of the movie. The effects are absolutely stunning. As you have read countless times previous the Battle of the Pelennor fields is one of the most exhilerating thrill rides and certainly one of the grandest film battles. My mouth was agape even the third time viewing the Rohirrim stare in horror amidst the low rumble of the charge of the gargantuan Mamukil during the winged fell beasts diving into the white city of Minas Tirith and the arrival of the Army of the Dead. In subtler aspects CGI has been used masterfully to craft a thoroughly convincing and memorable performance of a key character. The marriage of Andy Serkis acting and the impecable craft of WETA animators created a Gollum worthy of remembrance. The settings are dazzling particularly the psychedelic green glow of the foreboding Minas Morgul Minas Tirith itself and the atmospheric horror of Shelobs lair. Mordor is the true hell of Middle Earth as the strongholds of men are the light. The acting though starkly Shakespearean at times is particularly effective. The relationship between Frodo and Sam is brought to the forefront powerfully conveying that the most important thing driving these characters through the most evil of places is their friendship. Miranda Otto is given a chance to shine as Eowyn the caged warrior who finally gets an opportunity to fight for those she cares for. Her confrontation with the Witch King promulgated by the line I will KILL you if you touch him never ceased to send a shiver down my spine. Though wooden at times the acting successfully moves the gears of the film. Without the burden of having to establish many characters and settings as the first two films did The Return of the King allows development of many characters who were initially marginalized. Billy Boyd is particularly effective this time around as Pippin. Howard Shores musical  is once again stirring as ever molding a grandness of scale with the closeness and conflict of relationships. The sound design is equally awe inspiring: the Nazgul shrieks and grinding stone of a collapsing city never fail to elicit a response. Yes there are shortcomings. Many very interesting scenes from the book didnt make the final theatrical cut. The confrontation with Saruman and the Scouring of the Shire are two notable examples. However although I have been a Tolkien enthusiast since I first read the books when I was 8 or 9 years old I do not share the cynicism of many reviewers. Apart from the obvious reason that the films run-time already exceeds 3 hours there is a simple question of interpretation. Certain sacrifices needed to be made to craft a feasible film for the movie going public. Furthermore This is merely a certain group of peoples vision of the books. We all have different images of Middle Earth in our minds. The fact that a scene is left out of a movie does not necessarily make it a poor or insufficient telling of a story. I find it interesting for example that hardly any reviewers of Star Wars criticized the movie for having not contained scenes from Lucas original book. It positively surprised me that so many people have read and enjoyed these fabulous books to offer such valid comments out of their love for the trilogy. Im sure that the DVD extended edition will please the palate of anyone who was disappointed with the removal of certain scenes. In conclusion this film is a gorgeous reminder that CGI can enhance a movie-going experience without sacrificing the human element of film. I am wholly satisfied with Peter Jacksons vision and thank all who worked on this film for bringing such an intricate interpretation of three of my favorite novels to the screen.positive,warning spoiler alert which actually isnt a spoiler but i am just doing this so i wont get black listed now to start off what i love about this movie is that it skewers conventional thinking in almost every aspect of the film and does not just skewer it but it unleashes an entire swath of that could be possible type stuff into the films very amazing plot warning warning not so much a spoiler alert ahead while most people usually find it offensive to kill a head of state i find it refreshing to see directors who arent afraid to go there sort of speak but trust me it goes there pretty well wink wink the movie itself is filled with an elaborate but easy to follow storyline with uncanny plot twists and unexpected you kinda understand but kinda hate him bad guys kinsmen will remain in my heart one of the best and most unapologetic spy films i have ever seen just a heads up if you are in any ways biased towards politics of conservative liberal progressive green republican or any kind of ends justify the means marxist kinda politics this movie isnt for you so my word of advice is to pretend for about 2 hours that your not associated with any politics what so ever and enjoy the filmpositive,Walking More Walking Gandalfs back b****es Suck on dat Orc pee pee Some more walking A battle I can smell the c**t of Sauron I like the luscious hair on Gandalf and Saruman and Gimli the Dwarf and Aragorn and William Turner I think im gonna go eat corn and hot dogs now go watch Remember Frodo dies in the end Sam is secretly a Cannibal A young hobbit once tried to save me I ate his liver with some Orc juice and a nice pumpkin stew hf-hf-hf-hf-hf-hf 12 Years a Hobbit Argo-rn The Artist Who is also a Hobbit The Hobbits Speech The Hurt Shire Shiredog Millionaire Who is a hobbit No Country for old Hobbits The Departed In which hobbits depart Sister Act 2: Back in the Hobbit Million Dollar Hobbit The Lord of the Flies: Hobbits back to kill Mordor A beautiful Ring Gladi-hobbit I dont have energy for the rest bye see you in heaven homie or Mordor whatever makes sense to you PEACE MOTHALOVA EGGS AND SAusage AND POOPpositive,Vincent Vega and Jules Winnfield are two hit men on the hunt for a briefcase whose contents were stolen from their boss Marsellus Wallace They run into a few unexpected detours after they retrieve the case Marsellus is out of town and hes gotten Vincent to take his wife Mia out for a night on the town Things go smoothly until one of them makes a huge error Butch Coolidge is a boxer has been approached by Marsellus and been told to throw his latest fight When Butch ends up killing the other boxer he must escape Marsellus Pumpkin and Honey Bunny are two lovebirds who have decided to rob the restaurant theyre currently eating at But the restaurant doesnt turn out to be as easy as the other places theyve robbed I cant say anything about this film that no one hasnt said before but the film is phenomenal its groundbreaking and its one of the coolest films ever to be released in the nineties But why is it Its because its flawless seamless and no matter how many times you see the movie and I guarantee you will see it more than five times it never gets boring and there is always something new and unseen to catch your attention Tarantino has crafted a timeless movie and it will be remembered in years and years and years to come as one of cinemas greatest masterpieces alongside Citizen Kane Casablanca and The Godfather The cast are impeccable and this film resurrected two flagging careers in Willis and Travolta especially Travolta whose every film for the next three years would be box office gold and its down to this Plus dont forget not many people had heard of Samuel L Jackson before this and after this hes been in nearly every film ever made since and you watch them because you are waiting for that Jules Winfield magic Every scene is wonderful every set piece is perfect and the script is sparkling its pure gold The weak link in the film Tarantinos cameo but hey this is his invention so Ill let him off One of the last great films ever madepositive,Very mild spoilers First off Im a huge fan of batman comics cartoons movies etc. and I am delighted with this movie. It has made batman a popular superhero for everyone and is an intense thrilling action packed spectacle. The way two-face comes into play is done very well. Heath Ledgers Joker is fantastic and acting all round is brilliant. There is a lot of excitement and batman is truly a dark knight. The action is very well done and a lot of the time it is different from straight up fighting I cant believe how well it has been done comparing it to previous installments. Go watch this movie now. Im sure you will love it Batman has become cool to a massive audience with this one movie. Brilliantpositive,very good moviehave a lot of special effecta lot o magic my favorite.very good moviehave a lot of special effecta lot o magic my favorite.very good moviehave a lot of special effecta lot o magic my favorite.very good moviehave a lot of special effecta lot o magic my favorite.very good moviehave a lot of special effecta lot o magic my favorite.very good moviehave a lot of special effecta lot o magic my favorite.very good moviehave a lot of special effecta lot o magic my favorite.very good moviehave a lot of special effecta lot o magic my favorite.very good moviehave a lot of special effecta lot o magic my favorite.positive,very good in everything caster act very well can show the any emotions how stress and pressure its is best action scene Lastly Great comeback from BatmanBruce Wayne .nice drama scene ending is a little bit shock but is change to good .I would like to thank you Chistopher Nolan to help Batman series from death in Batman and Robin that is very bad but you make Batman revive again with 3 movies and its wonderful and amazing make me like its very much Im very sad because this is last episode of Batman that you will do in this series I want to see more Batman movie that you direct it . You create a plot of the stories very well in this 3 movies .The enemy of Batman like Scarecrow Joker and Bane can fight Batman very close and close to win Batman but hero is hero for surelypositive,Very good acting exceptionally interesting storyline creating his own ambiance and keeping your attention till the very least scene. John Travolta shows hes a great actor and Bruce Willis always gets the best out a character you have to watch the movie at least two times to get a good view on the whole storyline.positive,Very few movies that made me cry ... and The Shawshank Redemption is certainly one of them. I remember when I first went to see this movie in my freshman year in college. The movie made me appreciate freedom and true friendship. Very powerful picture indeed and each actor deserved an Oscar for their great performance. It is sad that the movie did not get the true scale of recognition it deserved but being on the IMDb top 250 movies of all time based on peoples votes is a great way to show the well earned appreciation. If you did not watch this movie yet then you missed a lotpositive,Usually I dont want to see a movie more than once in a theater let alone a movie this long. But I just want to see it again as well I cant wait for the extended version to come out on DVD. However i know that it will be a while with how good and popular it is.positive,Unlike previous letdowns this year Return of the King was excellent. A perfect 10. Coming in at 3 and a half hours the movie is really long...but until the last 20 minutes you really dont know. The plot acting effects and story keep people glued to their seat the entire time. Sean Astin deserve atleast a nod if the statue as Best Supporting Actor Oscar. Elijah Wood could recieve a nod for Best Actor. This movie will definately win Best Effects Best Musical  and could win Best Movie this year at the Oscars. It was that good. You should go see it right now. Stop staring at the computer screen and go. This movie is that good.positive,Undoubtedly one of the greatest movies I have ever seen. The outstanding performances by Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman left me with feelings so profound of being in that prison with them. Be warned that the first half of the film is visually and psychologically confronting. The film deals with fundamental themes of friendship and hope whilst delivering some very powerful social commentary. I am left questioning the state of our justice system. We lock away these threats to society alienate them and subject them to the most hostile and unnatural of environments. Then when they have served their life terms we throw them back into society with the expectation for them to live normally and abide by values never once upheld or taught in their filthy prison cells. The Shawshank Redemption tells a very powerful story. A story that made me laugh and cry. It ignited just about every human emotion I could possibly experience in just over a two hour period of time. A truly amazing film 10 out of 10 from mepositive,Un Predictable Amazing Film That is the only word to express this whole movie It is almost impossible to predict every scene that is shown For example when Trabolta not sure with his names spelling carries Uma who was dying and goes to the guy who sold the drug multitude of people would think that Uma would die and Trabolta falls in peril with the boss but guess what They success saving Uma And did Uma told the boss whole this Nope she kept her mouth shut Did this scene affect the story Not at all everything is solved and actually this scene is not the final scene of the movie It was just the part of beginning But the most fascinating part is that in this movie the big story are pretty predictable but the little small storys elements are totally unpredictable How is this possible cause it is Tarantinos film No respect for girls violence no respect for views visual he just make it the way he want to and that is the power that most of the directors cant have thats the power of the bravery YOU BETTER WATCH THIS AWESOME FILM AS FAST AS POSSIBLEpositive,Umm I am speechless or in this case typeless to not even describe how this movie is. There is a turn at every corner and I mean awesome freaking out heart stopping scary stuff. Also there are several beautiful visual effects going on here like the spectacular Batman-jumps-out-of-window- into-plane-with-Chinese-crook-in-hand stunt. That was awesome. The hospital explosion was great as well and Harvey dies If you watched the first movie then prepare to get your shoes socks and everything blown off then this is the movie for you. I really sorry that Heath Ledger died though. He was a great actor in this movie. Just watch it dont hesitate watch it. Good luck.positive,two hours and forty minutes summarize twelve years of a boys life the director richard linklater began this project in 2002 shooting one week per year linklater was able to show in a simple way the personality of a man being formed something never seen in cinemas for sure the screenplay is simple and doesnt appeal for melodrama even with dramatic moments they are always short scenes after all these moments happen in everybodys life but they always pass the simplicity of the screenplay is one of the biggest achievements of the movie without expository dialogues it totally convinces the audience but that happens because of the actors too mason the protagonist is interpreted by ellar coltrane his performance is very natural it is very interesting and touching the way that he grows up and discovers life its one of the subtleties of the movie beside mason the film ends up showing the story of the characters who are related to him patricia arquette is his mother the way that she transmits the growing of the character is impeccable other actor who is excellent in this film is ethan hawke masons father the dialogues between father and son are very natural which beatle is the best? are they going to make another star wars? etc richard linklaters direction is very good either first of all its necessary to highlight his courage and patience to realize such project the movie has some gorgeous sequenceshots some of them are even repeated as a narrative technique richard creates a very beautiful visual message the soundtrack is great too beside of memorable and touching the songs help to situate the audience in time for example the movie begins with coldplays yellow showing us that we are in 2002 boyhood is a movie like no other it is impossible not identify with at least one moment of masons life for that reason the innovation as a cinematographic work the direction details and the simplicity of the screenplay boyhood is a memorable movie one of the best if not the best of the yearpositive,truly a strong addition to the marvel cinematic universe and faithful to its comics guardians of the galaxy does more than entertain the audience it takes the viewers to this level of awesomeness in a rather messy manner but its totally worth sitting through rocket and groot were my personal favorites i love the way the makers filled this movie with humor and style this is perhaps one of the strongest movies of 2014 along with marvels captain america the winter soldier perhaps slightly better depends on how you wanna look at it also id like to add that this movie is oscar worthy dont get me wronggroot is the best animated feature of the year so far and the visual effects were also pretty impressive only time will tell if this movie can maintain it i also love the fact that they are linked to the avengers via thanos if you havent watched it already go see it asappositive,Truly a masterpiece. This film was more than worthy of its 11 Oscars. The fellowship was stunning the two towers was inspiring but the return of the king was truly the greatest film i have ever seen. The thing that is most amazing about the return of the king is that it fills the jigsaw of its predeceors and does it with such epic granduer emotion and inspiration that i know very few people who were not amazed by it. I myself have read the Lord of the Rings by Tolkien and in light of this can say that this film has to be one of the adaptations in recent times. Peter Jackson I feel simply could not have done a better job in using the beautiful new zealand landscape to portray Tolkiens vision. Without a doubt the speech roars and sheer numbers of the rohirrim at the pellennor charge in the sunset is truly the greatest sequence of film i have ever seen. People say the ending is too long I say it was perfect as it gave a heart felt and fitting deneaumont and ended a truly remarkable trilogy that will not be soon forgotten.positive,Toward the beginning of the film Bruce Willis face appears inside the sleaziest of bars in the San Fernando Valley But instead of the self-confident and wise-cracking characters he played in Moonlighting and Die Hard he dons a very different mask We notice Willis is not speaking but listening Listening to a voice of authority played by a lesser-known actor Ving Rhames as some kind of underworld kingpin And then we understand Willis is listening to a superior Willis nods and speaks very little  he is subservient to this voice and the Willis we have come to know is no longer Willis but a pawn in a much larger game in which he does not wield much power This is one of my favorite scenes with Willis showing his range as an actor and being able to descend from higher stardom into the lower depths of humility We learn that Willis is being paid off for some kind of act The envelope containing the payoff money is presented by the kingpin whose face is yet unseen Just as he is about to hand the goods over he immediately jerks it back Willis does not try to grab the payment but sits patiently waiting for the superior to hand him the goods Willis knows he cannot have the payment until the superior is ready and willing to give it to him The gesture is a symbolic reminder of who is really in power and its not Willis Willis humble scene captures well the flavor of the entire film called Pulp Fiction a masterpiece of sub-culture drama but definitely not for all tastes Characters and story are all spontaneous These people live on the edge on the darker periphery of American reality Instead of going to football matches they kill people in sporting events Instead of having drinks at the Hilton they overdose on intense psychedelics And if they arent careful they may end up either on the business end of some hit mans 45 or in a remote dungeon where people are into S & M This is certainly not for those whose favorite movie is the Sound of Music and their favorite music is sung by Doris Day Samuel Jackson and John Travolta play two hit men in service to the kingpin underworld lord But they never discuss their missions Instead they banter about all kinds of irrelevant subjects like the names for American burgers on the menu in Paris This chit-chat is a breath of fresh air and probably a lot more realistic than other films in which characters are discussing the plot ad infinitum The hit mens stories intersect with another plot line involving Bruce Willis a boxer who is on the take from the same underworld lord to throw a fight But these are just the bare bones Throughout the film the hit men the boxer and the kingpin weave an intricate tapestry of plots and subplots told in a non-linear style Part of the beauty of Pulp Fiction that ranks it one of the most innovative of films is that it collates as a movie puzzle Events occur out of sequence rather than told in a straight linear fashion Scenes happen in the middle of the film that are the end of the story The first and last scenes of the whole film which are in my opinion the best are the middle of the story not the end And yet the events of the last half of the first scene are not shown until the very end which turns out to be the last scene of the movie but not the last scene of the story Prior to Pulp Fiction I dont know if there existed any American movies daring enough to pull such cinematic misdirection and make it work Some European filmmakers may have done this but rarely such an innovative structure has occurred in American feature films And yet Tarantino makes it work and you understand by films end how all the pieces fit together The collation is similar to Tarantinos first production Reservoir Dogs but he takes those innovations to the next degree Because of the subject matter not everyone will be able to enjoy Pulp Fiction But I think thats a mark of a great film which is ironically what Hollywood studio executives try to avoid Hollywood wants everyone to like a film not just some people But the price paid for this curtailing to everyones tastes is a marked lack of visionary works Luckily someone saw the value of Pulp Fiction and gave it the funding to allow it to happen The result is one of the most tantalizing of cinematic experiences but not the kind of movie youll give your grandmother positive,Totally and absolutely wonderful in every way. I could go on and on about the beautiful cinematography how the story was summed up in a very satisfying way and how spectacular the battle scences were but I think that my summary says it all. See it for yourself.positive,Tolkien s works had been put into TV with animation by Rankin/Bass 1977 and 1979. In 1978 Ralph Bakshi had animated the first two books of the famous trilogy to the silver screen. And now with todays technologyan all-star cast and a fabulous music  New Line Cinema has brought the the trilogy to a new level in a live-action spectacle and one of the best film series of the 21th century. Each scene has hearta bit of humourheart-thumpin action and excellent effects. And I should like to tell you that Rings is what got me to love four of the films stars - Elijah WoodOrlando BloomViggo Mortensen and Liv Tyler. In this adrenaline-rushing conclusion of our adventure The War of The Ring has began and Frodo & Sam who are led by Gollum continue their dangerous quest to destroy The One Ring. But they are unaware of the trap that set for them by Gollum. Meanwhile Aragorn Legolas Gimli and Gandalf are united with Merry & Pippin at the now destoryed Isengard thanks to them Treebeard and the other Ents. Now the friends celebrated their victory. But Aragorn was worried of Frodo. And in the dead of the night Pippin snuck out of bed to take a peek at Sarumans palantir that was found and confiscated. But something happened the palantir showed him The Eye of Sauron and that he is planning to attack Minas Tirithpositive,today i had the pleasure of experiencing richard linklaters pet project boyhood this is easily the greatest cinematic experience ive had in a long time considering linklater is one of my favorite working directors i am happy to say that high expectations were surpassed this is his best work to date the concept of filming for 12 years couldve easily come off as a gimmick but thankfully linklater who is one of the least selfindulgent and relaxed directors out there uses this ambition with natural depth and substance the 12 year deal is icing on the cake this is top notch filmmaking on a technical and emotional level one of the best traits about linklater is that he never overplays tearjerking situations or gets unrealistically dramatic he really understands the human soul its an epic yet charming honest and down to earth film i feel like just about anybody could resonate with it in some way i can easily see this going down as a universally loved american classic right next to films like 12 angry men pulp fiction and one flew over the cuckoos nest i strongly recommend it to everybody its truly a film that deserves to be seen i cant thank everyone involved with making this masterwork enough for being so patient i think it dethrones there will be blood as my favorite film of the 21st century thus far go see itpositive,To put it simply this is one of the best movies I have ever seen Writer/Director Quentin Tarantino obviously spent a lot of time carving out this masterpiece Quentin prides himself on being very talented at writing dialog and he proves it here more than in any other of him films in my opinion Be warned though this movie is not for the faint of heart as it has sternum puncturing needles drugs and a lot of violence But that just adds to the movie for me The plot lines are masterfully interwoven and the characters are lifelike and very believable When I turned 40 I did something I always wanted to and rented out a movie theater and the one film that I chose for my friends and I to watch was Pulp Fiction It is at the top of IMDbs top 250 and it is on AFIs top 100 for a reason it is master craft film making and it is one of my personal all time favoritespositive,To call The Shawshank Redemption a great film would be doing it no justice at all. This is a film that when I watched it the first time I couldnt believe how good it was. I expected a film that would pass the time by and I got a film that I could identify with. If you are feeling sad and you think the worlds a rubbish place this fills you with hope. I love the opening scene where the camera pans around the prison and then the music kicks in it makes you feel awe-inspired. The acting was brilliant you believed what everyone said some films the words are delivered with such cheesiness and fake ness that it makes you want to throw up. I have watched Spiderman and even the lines in that make you feel that they mean nothing they just sound good. The film and book reciprocated the message Hope Springs Eternal which means so much because we always live in hope that tomorrow it will be better things might change for us and hope never dies. I think when Tim Robbins speaks about music how you can never take it away because its in your head. If I have a rubbish day at work then its true that music just lifts you which is re-emphasised with the scene where he plays the music full blast around the prison this of example of piece of script which means so much. The movie uses music to its full potential to give more impact to the words and the characters. This film cannot replicated because the film is a piece of art the Director wanted to make money but he also wanted to make a piece of film that made you feel something that had some effect on you after the movie was over. The movie has no bad points its what a story should be about it takes you somewhere that you nether been and makes you feel you lived that experience and you can learn from that experience. The lines delivered will always be remembered Get busy living or get busy dying this is the dilemma we face in everyday live. This will live in my memories forever not like the sorry cash-ins of movies. This is a brief synopsis of how great the movie is but words just seem so little to explain the brilliance of this film.positive,To be honest I enjoy reading a good novel more than watching a film. You usually get far more character development than in a movie e.g. Puzos The Godfather. But not with Shawshank. This is the closest thing film has to a perfect story. The characters pacing plot monologues and every other element contribute to an inspirational yarn with a fulfilling ending. Brooks suicide is the only film scene that has ever moved me to tears and if you watch just one film in your life - let it be this. Not a film which others have tried to mimic for a good box office e.g. LOTR: The Return of the King The Godfather but an original stand-alone film that in my opinion will never be surpassed in qualitypositive,To be brief as a man who has watched thousands of movies in my life Shawshank redemption is the best movie I have ever seen. The plot the way it develops the acting the portrayal of every human emotion and the ending makes 99% of movies seem like just a waste of time. I didnt see it until a few years after it came out. My sister said it was a great movie. It was on HBO so I watched it. I was speechless. I have always found it strange that it was from a Steven King novel. Ive read a few not that one and what comes through in the movie doesnt seem like anything that would be in a Steven King novel. A better movie may come along but it may be a while.positive,Tim Robbins as Andy a successful banker that was arrested and charged and sent to the Shawshank prison for the murders of his wife and her lover that he did not commit. Morgan Freeman as Red the longtime lifer who serves as narrator and friend to Andy. In order for Andy to help the young man cope with prison as Red is really used to it having lived there for years. Red is also a smuggling expert at contraband and gives people cigarettes posters of Rita Hayworth to Andy among other things. As people at the prison look up to him. Red has also been denied parole so many times he looks at getting parole as useless along the way. Both must deal with the harsh reality of prison. As both need to lean on one another to survive. And Andy is beaten up by Mark Rolston as Red and his thugs and after Red is beaten up himself and paralyzed as Andy is no longer bothered again. In the process Andy is moved from the laundry job. Andy works with the corrupt warden Sam Nortonplayed evilly by Bob Gunton and corrupt and sadistic guard Captain HadleyClancy Brown in the prison library and fixes taxes and money laundering for them personally. Andy is placed in solitary confinement a couple of times once for refusing to not keep on money laundering for the warden. Who in turn would take away his job and the library he has been working at. As he really wants to be released as he did not commit the murders. And with the help of the little rock hammer that he gets from Red to build rocks to play checkers with to pass the time in prison. He wants something more to do that than. Wont tell you nothing more as you have to see it for yourself. A movie of hope and encouragement. As it shows you should never ever give up hope as that keeps you going. Robbins and Freeman make a great duo. And the chemistry between them looks really real. Great writing and great acting by them and the supporting players Really you will love this movie if you had not seen it.positive,Three renowned actors and my favorite director Quentin Tarantino go on create a movie masterpiece. The amazing actor Samuel Jackson plays an astounding character who is the king of cool. In addition John Travolta is a gangster who is up for any job. Moreover John McCain plays a boxer who doesnt take the fall. Not to mention the rest of the cast who each give a memorable moment throughout Pulp Fiction. Theres no dull moments in Tarantinos finest work. The story takes the viewer on ride through drug deception murder and everywhere in between. Im a little bias towards Jackson and Tarantino but for any movie lover this is a must watch.positive,This will be a short review not because I do not have time but because of the magnificence it brought to me is in my mind forever more. I remembered seeing this in the cinema of my hometown in Sweden it was the best of my life. I had goosebumps throughout the whole movie. A must see for those who have not. Even now I feel like a kid again watching it. My childhood of sword-plays with sticks in the forestspretending to be fighting an army of orcs is a truth while watching this with surround sound. The costumes the characters I salute Tolkien for this glorious work and salutes Jackson for the splendid adventure he has captures on the cinema screenpositive,This was the one movie I had been waiting for all year so I wasnt disappointed when I saw it yesterday. I knew that there were some important scenes cut from the movie but it didnt matter to me because I know they will be there in the extended version dvd set. It was fantastic to see Aragorn become who he was born to be it was his courage and belief in Frodo that inspired many of the others to continue on. I think anyone would want someone like Sam to be their friend his friendship had more power than the ring itself. I honestly cant decide which of the three are my favourites because I love them all but this definitely is a trilogy that Ill never forget.positive,This was the best batman movie ever. RIP Heath Ledger but he brought the joker character to life. I personally would have called it the Joker instead of batman because if it wasnt for the joker then the movie would have been boring.However I did enjoy a lot of the action scenes like the opening of the movie when the men with the clown masks were breaking into the bank. Also the scene when the joker is trying to kill the comissioner & batman ties the rope around the vehicle & it flips forward. I thought that was a very cool special effect.I wonder if they are going to add robin as batmans side kick in the next one. Cant wait to see the next chapter.positive,This was probably my favorite trilogy of all time as throughout movie history there have not been all that many good fantasy movies that have been released so these films fill that void for me. This last chapter wraps up the story nicely as Frodo and Sam are very close to where they need to be and the army of Sauron are trying to finish off man once and for all. This movie is a bit different than the last one in the fact that the Hobbits Frodo and Sam and Gandolf the wizard are more of the focus of this one rather than Aragon Gimli and Legolos who were more the focus of the last one. This one has epic battles and great visuals as well. It is also very well acted. Sean Astin does a particularly good job as Sam in this one as his character has a lot more impact in this one. All in all a very good movie that wrapped up a very good trilogy that was one of the few that did not have a weak movie in the bunch. I would write more but I am sure there are plenty of reviews that do the movie more justice than I can.positive,This was one of THE best movies I have ever seen My dad told me about this movie and at first I was reluctant to watch it because it looked old but after the first 10 minuets I was hooked It does kinda get confusing sometimes but you will defiantly pick up all the parts and by the end of the movie you will understand everything There is a perfect balance of action which includes blood shooting and wicked gun fights Comedy because lets be honest Samuel Jackson is just down right hilarious There is a lot of cursing but it fits perfectly with the scenes I would totally recommend this to all of my friends Couldnt think of a better way to spend a night then watching this movie 10/10 would watch againpositive,This was my first movie ever.I mean it when i say that i have never been interested in jack squat before watching LOTRyesthe caps is important. I saw it in Bahrain first in Budaiyafor those of you who dont know where Bahrain isFYI beautiful placemust go. AnywaysI couldnt believe the story line and the details of the characters and where they come from as well as their homelandsits a completely different feeling whenever i watch it but I will always have that feeling in my mind that im watching something worthwhile which is better than whats out there nowwith one question. What wouldve happened if i never saw this movie I told my best friend at the time and no surprise he got hooked too. I think anyone in the world will agree with me when I say that LOTR is the greatest and most respected Movie series accompanied by of course The Godfather. Just ask Aguero.And im an Arsenal fanpositive,This was a reflection of the count of Montecristo especially the jailbreak scene. But still i find it fascinating enough to impress me and have a lot of ingredient included in it. This is probably the most amazing movies from the nineties apart from Forrestgump and back to the future and all. It also reminded me of the series The Oz Its cool and all but theres this mainstream way of showing jail and high school as the same in Hollywood a lot. probably so but im afraid that not to be true.And one more thing i noticed was that viewers seems to be confused a number of times as the story slips from one another scene and is really complicated. that is it started as a man who have been betrayed by his love to whove been framed then jailed bitched from there and rules there becomes everyones favorite and the warden becomes his worst enemy and teaches him a lesson while he was on the go.positive,This trilogy took my breath away it made me laugh it made me wince it even made my eyes tear up in some parts but in totality what it did was completely blow my mind Now lets get to the third chapter - The Return of the King. Unbelievable I will start with the acting. The entire cast was superb beyond imagination. Firstly Viggo Mortensen again delivers a brilliant performance as Aragorn of a King emerging from an outlaw. It has been wonderful to watch his steady transformation over the two previous instalments but it really comes full tilt here. Sean Astin also deserves special mention as the true hero that has been buried inside Samwise Gamgee surfaces in the final film navigating some of the films most frightening and suspenseful scenes. Reliable as ever is sir Ian Mckellen as thee wise Gandalf and now as general of the Gondorian armies. Finally worth mentioning is Elijah Wood and Andy Serkis. Elijah perfectly portrays the pain and weariness of an eroding soul. And as the wonderfully created CGI masterpiece Andy Serkis brings life to the creature Gollum through his movements and voice. Next up is the direction and script. Oh And how wonderful these aspects are Peter Jackson surpasses the scope and epic glory of the two astonishing previous chapters to bring us something beyond cinema and beyond epic. The craft with which the New-Zeelander constructs this film is amazing. He builds in every aspect necessary to forward the narrative but gives it all ample time to wonderfully unfold. Working from a brilliant script written by himself his wife Fran Walsh and Phillipa Booyens he creates the utter magic on screen that was so evident in the undeniably majestic literary masterpieces of JRR Tolkien. The sweeping  just adds to the epic scope of the film and is so wonderful that it almost becomes a character all by itself. The Story follows Frodo and Sams final steps towards Mount Doom with their treacherous companion Gollum in Tow. The Other members of the fellowship are gearing up for the final battle of middle earth. Aragorn is absent from the preparations while he recruits the army of the dead to fulfill their oath. Using Anduril which is the Narsil after it has been reforged. The battle scenes are even more impressive than the visually stunning battle of Helms Deep from the Two Towers. With especially the battle of Pelenor fields being up there with the Final battle as some of the best battle scenes ever created. In the extended edition look out for the scenes where the terrifying Witch - king of Angmars true power comes into scope. Many have complained about the films multi tiered ending. But to me this is a well deserved farewell to some of our most loved cinema characters. if there was an option to give this trilogy more than 10/10 I would but seeing as this is the highest honor I can bestow on it a 10 shall suffice.positive,This trilogy is the best movie I ever saw. It contains everything that you will see in a movie fantasy horror drama action romance some comedy and more. The effects are great and its based on one of the best book I ever read. Either the cast is very good chosen. Jackson made everything good. It was great as I saw it for the first time. After that I saw the movies about teen times and every time I liked it more and more. I was very happy as I heard the news that the Hobbit begun to be filmed and as I saw the first part I was very happy. Only the cast was not very good for me but in all it was good. I cant wait to see in the cinemas the second part of the Hobbit.positive,This trilogy is the BEST ever. I love it  Every time i watch those movies i realize that ill never be bored to watch them again. Every thing is awesome from the story - till the screenplaypicturemakeupfashion design and the EXCEPTIONAL actors that make those movies a cinematic MASTERPIECE And now after 10 years remains just as good From my point of view i think Viggo Mortensen would have deserved an Oscar  best actor  for his role as Aragorn  it fits him like a glove . Congratulations to Peter Jackson and his entire team for his achievement and i look forward to see the movie  The Hobitt positive,This touching and heart warming film is the most perfect celebration of the human spirit I have seen. Andy Dufresne wrongly convicted of murdering his wife and her lover finds the strength not only to change himself but to bring hope to those around him in Shawshank Prison. This inspiring story is interwoven with a soundtrack which invokes every emotion from haunting and chilling to stirring and beautiful. When you go to see a movie and it touches you with its poetry music and its atmosphere and leaves you with a sense of victorious satisfaction it is a triumph. Field of Dreams was the first movie which invoked these emotions in me. Shawshank Redemption is even more powerful for its simplicity. It doesnt pretend to be clean nor could it be called a family movie. It is brutal and violent at times horrifying and sickening at others. However the title says it all. Redemption is what this story is all about. And it is not necessarily redemption for the actual crimes you might have committed but it is redemption for the way you have lived your life. What emerges can only be called a maginificent piece of art. This is what movies were meant to be.positive,This summer has been the summer of the comic book movie. Amazing movies have come out of the genre this summer: Iron Man Hellboy 2 and The Incredible Hulk from what Ive heard to name a few. At a time when people need a hero to usher them through bad times theyve been there for them at the multiplex. Weve seen these heroes deal with not only outward demons but inward demons as well anger hate alcoholism drugs etc. but none of them has dealt with them in the way that The Dark Knight doespositive,This single film alone qualifies Tarantino as a GENIUS Excellent cast of characters intriguing dialogue subtle humor superb soundtrack everything It is one of my most favorite movies to watch ever The plot twists are excellent This raises the expectation for any other work that Tarantino doespositive,this second film in the dark knight trilogy shows us the real side of Christopher Nolans the dark knight. from all of the batman movies and series ever made this is the one who stands out to be best. There is no way of mentioning this film without talking about Heath Ledgers performance as the Joker he is showing us the dark and magnificent side of the Joker Heath Ledger gives possibly his best performance of his life in this movie we have seen Jack Nicholsen as one Joker before but Ledger came up with this incredible interpretation of the character not the soft side but the evil explicate character we see in the comics. the tics the mind-blowing plans from the guy who doesnt come up with plans. Christian Bale is clearly the best Batman of my choice he does the dark batman to his own and makes him his dark knight the cooperation Bale Nolan and Ledger have had through this film is incredible making it one of the best films made of my opinion  for a truly excellent game ALL the elements must come together. Everyone involved must have perfect form. Director Darabont must have been at the top of his game when he put this gem together. Of course the actors were excellent  Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins seldom disappoint. The thing that makes this movie exceptional is that Darabont coaxed the best performances out of the supporting actors also. Bob Gunton and Clancy Brown were utterly believable and bad guys dont come much worse than them. The other essential ingredient for a successful movie is simple: It must have a well thought out plot with a perfect beginning middle and end. So many movies fall over by getting at least one of these aspects wrong. Not so with Shawshank Redemption. Just like Goldilocks said This is just right Buy this one for your home collection because youll definitely want to see it again.positive,This review contains spoilers so better see the film and then read my review. Sometimes it makes me wonder why this film didnt go well in the box office. Shawshank redemption is not just about a story where a man escapes from a jail. It captures the life of people who spend their life in jail. I believe that jail life and free life are almost similar. Sometimes we enjoy and sometimes we feel sad whether you live in jail or not. Sometimes life doesnt make any sense at all. Some people succeed in their lives with ease and some people faces a great deal of hardship and still wont succeed in their life. These people are forced to the point of desperation. What they should know is that all of us have a destiny to reach and the main thing which matters the most is hope which you should need until the moment you die. If you believe in yourself and have hope then one day you will reach your destiny in this life or in your after life.This film has really changed my way of looking the life.positive,This one is by far the best of all Batman-movies in my opinion. It has suspense right from the start and keeps you gripped till the end.The acting is simply brilliant. Heath Ledgers Joker is the coolest villain ever and for me it is the best acting performance in the movie history Apart that the directing from Christopher Nolan is amazing. The staging and screenplay is fabulous. You dont want to miss this one out even if you do not like superheroes Surely one of the best movies ever. Not my personal best but it is definitely in the top 10 So to all you movie lovers: if you have not seen this one yet do it nowpositive,This movie was totally magnificent. Peter Jackson really shown 3 things he has created a saga as good maybe even better than star wars it has shown that it is way superior than the books and he has shown one of the best movies of all time. This movie won everything it was nominated for eleven and really deserved it. This movie was the only fantasy to ever win best picture and the third to win 11 Oscars. This movie has brilliant effects acting and anything else you can want from a film. The hobbits acted way better than the second one this did have and ending and it was the best of the saga. It is all i can say and let me rephrase it I am a strict critic and this movie has shown one of the best achievements ever. It is totally over-the-top recommended.positive,This movie was the best in the series simply because of Heath Ledgers RIP fabulous performance. His portrayal of the evil mastermind Joker was simply faultless. The other actors were good as well. Even though in Batman 3 Batman met a more powerful foe in Bane in this movie he met a villain with a brilliant mind in Joker. Also Harvey Dents transformation in Two-Face was nice he kept his coin tossing thing which i like in particular about him. He used his mind to catch criminals but from now on he will use his brain to be a great foe for our hero Batman. I strongly recommend this movie for those who like this genre of movies inspired by comic books.positive,This movie was simply fantastic. Action packed suspenseful and yet still enchanting. Acting in the movie is terrific especially from McKellen and Mortenson. Peter Jackson reached new heights with this masterpiece completely deserving the best picture Oscar. The plot follows the continuing adventures of the disbanded Fellowship of the Ring in their quest to destroy the powerful One Ring. Frodo Baggins Sam Gamgee and their guide Gollum are on a quest to the Cracks of Doom while the rest of the Fellowship is preparing for war with Sauron forger of the One Ring and his soldiers. It this complex plot that is part of the reason that this film is so good. The CGI is breathtaking especially for 2003. Everything in the movie looks lifelike. The cinematography in the movie is astonishing and sweeps one off of ones feet. Battle scenes are brilliantly choreographed intense and high-octane. I know I dont seem too exited about this movie but this movie is terrific. If you havent seen this movie see it. It is a classic and one of the best films out there.positive,This movie was released when I was all of 9 years old. Lucky for me I didnt come across it until nearly 13 years after the fact. I have always been a movie buff and aside from that a big fan of the writings of Stephen King. I had read the short story the film is based on and it led me to this film which I was certainly aware of prior but never checked out. Afterwards I had a new list of benchmarks for certain aspects of cinema. First and foremost was the story itself. The writing of this tale in screenplay form is absolutely brilliant. The story is fleshed out without lingering in certain areas it would have been easy to linger in and the pacing of the film is steady and constantly building emotional atmosphere. From the early feelings of confusion and bitter justice as our main character is judged by his peers to the dawning realization of what Shawshank Penitentiary has to offer for its masses of convicted felons. It all flows fabulously as the tale unwinds from the darkest despair of prison life into the slowly building and palpable hope Andy and Red seem to cultivate for the rest of the prisoners. Its this humanity in the face of inhumane conditions that is at the forefront of The Shawshank Redemptions impact. Second but just as vital was the casting. Tim Robbins has always been in my mind a criminally underrated acting talent. He always seems to carry a sense of outward vulnerability that belies an inner strength and in that conflict one always questions his motivation his reason for doing things. His skill set was married perfectly to the character of Andy Dufrense who instantly seems in mortal danger within the walls of Shawshank but eventually rises above the concrete and steel. Indeed its safe to say that mentally at least Andy spent very little time in that prison. Morgan Freeman played the role of Red Redding in a manner that I think no other actor could have done. He was not only a veteran of Shawshank he radiated a sense of calm wisdom and strong sense of brotherhood amongst his fellow inmates that lend themselves very well to Freemans on-stage abilities. As a man who can get things Red is instrumental in many inmates lives in Shawshank. Offering a variety of contraband items in return for the typical currency of incarcerated peoples cigarettes petty cash Red is as important a character as Andy in terms of the films overall message of hope despite hopelessness. And Morgan Freeman was the best man for that job. The excellent acting doesnt end there. Bob Gunton who seems to find a niche in playing white-collar criminal types portrays the warden of Shawshank as a sinister scheming man who hides his darker desires behind the Bible and an arrogant holier-than-thou attitude. William Sadler is another outstanding character actor similar to Gunton whose face is more popular than his name and who does a fine job as Heywood. One of the more important supporting roles was that of the hard right hand of the warden Guard Officer Hadley who was portrayed by Clancy Brown well known for his bad-ass-type roles. His no-nonsense hard-edged persona fits well and leaves you hating his character but appreciating his ability to make you hate someone who doesnt exist. Beyond the writing and the acting this movie was perfect in every other aspect. Ive seen it many times over the years often turning to it perhaps subconsciously during particularly rough or depressing patches. Ive very rarely come across a film that not only meets my expectations but exceeds them in a way that leaves me constantly comparing future films to it. The Shawshank Redemption is one of those films where the outstanding story and the remarkable talents of everyone involved combine to bring vivid fiction to life. A masterpiece of modern film-making that has lost none of its impact or relativity nearly 20 years later.positive,This movie was really well done 100% through. It is one of those films that is a classic because it is a powerful story but its also an intelligent film. We dont see that too much and I hope to see more films like this It makes me think of the essence of filmmaking and storytelling and how much that aspect of our industry is really honored. Every Director wants to tell a great story but few let the story tell itself. This is an intelligent film because it gets so involved with our character driven plot lines that you forget youre watching a movie at all. As a young filmmaker this film is a fantastic model to build a foundation around. Lets just hope studio thoughts dont pick up and they try to make a sequel/prequel...positive,This movie was one of the best I have seen. The graphics were great. The way they put the whole movie together was just awesome. I loved watching every second of it. The first time I watched it I watched it three times in a row because I couldnt get enough of the movie. The lord of the rings series is just amazing in itself. What they have to go through with the ring and what they have to fight and figure out on the way there. I absolutely loved this movie. One that will definitely go down in the history books as an amazing movie. I think everyone should see this movie and the others before and after it. They might feel the same way that I do about it. I love ITpositive,this movie was honestly a lot different than i had expected i was expecting more evil on maleficents part however there was more depth in her character and i think the movie did a great job expressing her character in a more complex way it was definitely a lot sadder than i had expected i cant get over how great angelina jolie was as the part of maleficent her expressions were extremely detailed and i was very impressed with her acting i think this movie is a definite yes and i will be back in theaters to watch it again it was a beautiful film and i think many will find that it is much more enjoyable than they had expected i will definitely be recommending this movie to otherspositive,this movie was great definitely a five star movie four star at the lowest tom cruise acted really well it was exciting and they didnt make it all killing death etc this movie was exciting as it sounded so there was no ripoff however i do think they could have created less talking and more doing so it would be very fun and not exactly like the real thing in life after all it is fictional stuff its no real its not based on a true story but besides that this movie was good this movie has very little cuss words which makes it more easier for more parents to saying yes to their kids on watching this awesome movie this is a movie for the young and old who love action like this i personally can not wait to get this on dvd and i can not wait to see its sequels mi2 mi3 and mission impossible ghost protocol you will want to do all the same enjoy this great movie that will always be a great spy classic for yearspositive,This movie was excellence at its best. In my mind it is great if you can watch a long movie and just not want it to end. Thats what this one did to me. Besides the point that the acting was some of the best youll see in the 90s. The story was golden. If you havent seen this get it now.positive,This movie was an incredibly blend of everything that makes movies interesting and fun From completely Three Dimensional characters to witty dialogue to outrageously funny situations Quentin Tarantino has molded years of pulp noir into something truly his ownpositive,This movie was amazing Peter Jackson has a true vision and this entire trilogy was wonderful. Tolkien would be extremely proud. The only thing that bums me out now is the fact that there arent any more to look forward to next year... How about making The Hobbit  its a sublime union that makes everything in the three movies relevant and provides satisfying closure all around. Many liberties are taken from the original novels but for the big screen it works to generate the best possible spectacle and make the plot work evenly. Themes of war corruption addiction good and evil and adventure all prevail. As before this film is crafted with excellent photography and editing. All the major players return and contribute fantastic performances in their respective roles especially Viggo Mortensen who stands out more in this film than before but it is always a pleasure to watch Ian McKellen as Gandalf along with the rest of the fellowship and all their allies. Writing is superb. This production boasts some excellent sets props and costumes. Special effects are huge  at its time it was most groundbreaking for generating the biggest armies ever seen on screen all at once. Despite aging a bit the effects are still impressive. Howard Shores music  is as masterful as ever. Return of the King delivers the best possible payoff for the Lord of the Rings trilogy and it might even outshine the Hobbit saga in the end. Not only does it boast some of the biggest battles but it is also a film with power and beauty. It has cemented itself as one of my all-time favorites was my number-one favorite for quite a few years and the Lord of the Rings saga overall remains one of the most sublime marriages between spectacle storytelling and style. If you watch the Extended Edition of this film you will be treated to about an hour of bonus scenes which offers a lot of excellent substance. Among the additions there are longer battle scenes a scene showing the fate of Saruman and Wormtongue an extended encounter with the Army of the Dead a parley with the Mouth of Sauron and more. I think most of these scenes are really awesome and this version of the film is definitely worth seeing. 5/5 Experience: Perfect | Story: Perfect | Film: Perfectpositive,This movie tops off what I as a fantasy lover have always dreamed of seeing. A world class true fantasy movie. This has to be one of the best movies I have seen in recent memory. The plot story line and Peter Jacksons vision were amazing. Again if you want to see a movie with heart passion determination soul. Then this is one that I would recommend A++positive,This movie rock. Best super hero movie of all times maybe. The Joker stole the entire show. Hes like a savage tornado on Gotham City and only Batman can stop him. The Joker is not the only bad ass in town. Two face is also here to make the life of batman a living hell. This film is not only an action movie but also a psychological drama. Never in a Batman movie a director explore so deep the mind of a super hero. Christopher Nolan make a wonderful job. The choice of Heath Ledger was a little bit critical but his performance shut all the critic up. And Aaron Eckart is the best Two face ever. OK its not tough to top the performance of the other but.positive,This movie represents the result of a hard working and amazing director Peter Jackson as well as amazing and emotive performances and the whole look is beyond epic. I love this film for its moral values there is nothing offensive in this movie which is refreshing and rare. An amazing conclusion to the best trilogy ever. Expect amazing battle sequences great acting great CGI amazing moral values and messages just a perfect film. This is more than a movie it is an experience and rightly deserved the 11 Oscars it proudly won. Peter Jackson really understands what the whole concept of Lord of the Rings is about he managed to capture the purity of Frodo and Sams friendship the epic nature of the big scale action sequences and i respect the script writing team philipa Fran Peter for creating the emotion which is filled in the film. This is a brilliant film which will last for generations :Dpositive,This movie really gorges with characters view angle and the normal from point A to point B is replaced with fickle sense of time  picture jumps round but in the same time gathers the plot in to one piece Pulp is cult positive,This Movie really deserves to be #1 in the Top 250. Its just so cheerful. If you havent seen it yet first read the book or the whole trilogy then you will understand the movie. Yes so I am not gonna tell you any spoilers. But if you read the book or saw the movie congratulations you understood the book and the movie at the same time. If you live in New Zealand everyone and you really loves the movie and the book and that is why New Zealand is famous because of The Lord of The Rings. The movie has great roles and characters like Frodo Baggins Gollum Sam Gandalf The Grey. And the movie is declared one of the best movies ever in numerous countries. And that was my review of The Lord of The Rings: The Return of The King.  who are also known for their mesmerizing characters and self-referential dialog. What they get is that QTs films are snub-nosed and brilliant with great inventive energy and personal to what QT is all about. Like his predecessors who influenced him QT understands that skill and craftsmanship are only half the work and that a passion for sticking to your guns and making strong personal films makes up the bulk of all great Hollywood legends. If you want to know what great film making is all about just watch Pulp Fiction and marvel at its excellence positive,This movie proves its worth of having top spot on IMDb list.It is not only entertaining but also with a lesson never loose hope as it is the best thing a man can have.Great acting displayed by lead actors specially Morgan freeman.Truly a moving movie with great moral&climax.Dialouges of this film are well written. You will miss something if HAVE not watch it. Highly recommendable for those who have give up their hope in life. they will find how hope will get best of them.I will say that viewers have truly voted for this film without under influence of big & popular name as it usually happens.Like godfather.Godfather is nice film but not nice enough to give points above 9 to it.positive,This movie not so yang but still great You were terrified by actor in this story I think it is best movie from 90-x Director is very creative person what stile we can call Tarantino stile Actors and play is great when i was watching this movie i feel atmosphere this story Sone time i watch again this movie because i like this story and stile this movie You can split your live for to part: before watch this movie and after I like watch this movie which my friend you can start watching from any part that is OK Tarantino is going to great master if he create only this movie it like icon cinema I havent watch movie lake this i mean so creative and unusually I recommended this movie for watchingpositive,This movie is without a doubt one of the if not the greatest achievement in the history of filmmaking .It is not just the best movie I have seen in my entire life but my best cinematic experience.Peter Jackson has changed the history of cinema with the amazing magnificent epic saga Lord of the rings.The Return of the king is a great conclusion to this breathtaking saga and is far way better then the first two episodes.Guys I do not recommend you to see this series you Must see it. If you want to see a movie than see this movie .I am serious i have seen it 20 times without exaggerating and if you don t like it than you know nothing about movies.The movie has won 11 Oscars and the whole saga 14 .the scenario is excellent the screenplay is superb the filming is perfect the costumes are magnificent the music is majestic.if I had too say one more thing it would be :go see this movie -. positive,this movie is unpredictableif you avoid the many movie clips that is it is heartwarming yes it has action yes they also mixed in a lot of comedy and adventure it has a little romancevery little it is well written with great special effects and so it is really easy to recommend to the pg13 movie crowd i intend to buy it the second it comes out marvel and disney are going to make a ton of money on this excellent film it is the best of all the marvel films they have done i state that not owning one comic book or reading anything at all about this characters i hope they start working on the sequel as soon as possibleand that they keep the same writers and the same directorpositive,this movie is undoubtedly one of the best of the decade its like no country for old men lord of the rings gladiator the departed there will be blood and the dark knight all of them considered the best of the 2000s its the first of its kind and it doesnt turn out to be a money grab but instead a must see because it takes place over 12 years the acting changes and so does writing directing and the overall environment simply it matures if this isnt up there for best pic at the oscars someone will have to answer for there crimes ps not a family movie more details in parents guidepositive,This movie is the third of a trilogy which starts off with The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring and then The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers and ended with The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King which is what I am writing about now and I believe it was the best out of the three. It was intriguing and mysterious which is what I enjoy when watching a movie. It goes for a fair amount of time just like the rest of the movies in the trilogy but it is worth it and you dont get bored unlike what you do in other movies that just go on forever about non-interesting things with no action. If you enjoyed this trilogy of The Lord of the Rings then I highly recommend you watch the trilogy of the Hobbits.positive,This Movie is the most amazing in the industrys history . The best in the way it shows sequence of the events . Morgan Freeman Played a remarkable role in the movie .... movie has the successful mix ever made of emotions anger  peace  mystery  hate  love  Betrayal and friendship ... this movie will always be milestone in the history of film industry .... View and full interaction figures and the absolute harmony between the team of the film clearly reflected in the article submissions .... The imposition of the spirit of the prison and the transfer of the wonderful scenes that way like a prisoner until the end of the film when liberated liberally of movies main characters essence of success was felt throughout the film that he is no life outside the walls but in some scenes .... its a perfect work by the standards of the industry ....positive,This movie is the best of everything the charaters are the best with each other and their environment. You have to love the pros as well as the antags. This movie as one reviewer once said of this movie it is the best movie of this generation The saddest part it is the last movie. The only thing I have to say that was a downer it needed more epic battles So my top 5 have now changed: 5=Scarface4=Matrix3=Lord of the Rings 32=Godfather1=Citizen Kane.positive,This movie is The best movie in Batman Trilogy.Its a wonderful acting by Christian Bale and Heath Ledger.According to me Heath Ledger was the most appropriate for the role of Joker.But it is very sad to tell that Heath Ledger is no more among us. Movie is full of thrill and Bruce Wayne with many more gadgets.Bale as usual has given us an another wonderful movie.The best part of the movie is that it keeps you enrolled. Bales SeriousnessMichael Caines advisesMorgan Freemans Humor and Jokers Dialogues keeps you free of boredom. This is must watch for Bales and Waynes Fans. This movie is not just 1 time watch and whoever do not love Batman I would surely ensure that after watching this movie they would forget that they once hated BATMAN. On the whole This Movie is just AWESOMEpositive,This movie is so famous believable and intriging that many rumors are circulated about it as if it were more than just a movie which is basically all that it is PULP FICTION is a perfect example of how effective a good film can be while becoming a part of American culture Its one of those times when you want to seek the director and badger him with questions only to not recieve answers because shallowing a deep masterpiece would only take away the magic PULP FICTION is not an exercize in creating thick plots but one in creating believable charasmatic characters All they do is talk simply because theyre cool funny charming fictional people whom we love to see talking The movies primary way of entertaining us is by showing us how each person talks uniquely And like every great film it relies heavily on performance Its one of my top ten and I give it a ***10****positive,This movie is simply the best Superb script directing and acting This movie cant really be compared with any other movies since its so different The story line jumps around and youll see scenes from other perspectives later in the film There is no start there is no ending but its a very good movie Ether youll hate this movie or youll love it You will probably love I did and a whole generation with mepositive,This movie is quite possibly one of the greatest movies ever written and produced Tarantino is a brilliant storyteller and one of the best in the business Reservoir Dogs exposed us to QT but Pulp Fiction made him a Godpositive,This movie is probably one of the greatest movies in the 21st century everything about it just spell genius all the charactersthe performancethe directingthe storyline and the actionbut contrary to what people may thinkHeath Ledgers Joker wasnt the best thing in the movie all the actors deserved Oscar nominations because the acting they did was marvelousor DCious see what I did thereanywayChris Nolan just Max out in genius and visionary and innovationits an amazing masterpiece that doesnt have a single flawa lot of the movies lately just gives you a choice quality or fun which is the case with Marveland DC movies these days the MCU just gives full throttle AWESOMNESS and fun while the DCCU tries hardly to have quality by making its movies serious and sad but fails horriblyYesMan of SteelIm talking about youat least Marvel successfully delivers fun and mind blowing action scenesbut this movie doesnt give you a choice it delivers: funawesomenessseriousnessqualitymeaningactingdirecting cinematography and just a heck of a villaini think the Joker was Awesomein every way but I think hes a wee bit overrated everything in the movie is mind blowing and deserves more credit as A movie than just one actors great performance. Watch The Dark Knight it changed my life just as it will do to youits The Godfather of our timethe Stairway To Heaven of moviesa complete and utter masterpiece which lacks nothingit may be the best movie of your life it may not but theres one thing for sure you will NOT be disappointedI think calling it an EPIC masterpiece is underselling it I think its much more than that its a life changing event in cinema an absolute Thriller and magnificent story. its one of the greatest movies of all time.positive,This movie is poetry. For those of you whove ever felt the way poetry rolls off of the tongue youll understand what I mean when I say this. The first thing that makes this movie great is Morgan Freemans ability to narrate the way he does. His soft yet ruff voice provides the audience with the belief that this man has endured many years of hardships and has gained wisdom and experience through trial and error. He is a natural story teller so his ability as a narrator is natural and smoothpositive,This movie is one that gives to wit the most part of being happy in this life. It is true that you might not be lucky enough in life but even in the midst of crap even when all your life has crumbled over your face hope is still your last hope. One night he caught his wife cheating and was thrown in jail for a murder that he had not committed and after all that he got raped What would you have done had you been in his shoes keep on hoping Well Andy not only had hope he gave hope to his fellow prisoners. The brilliant Morgan Freeman gives the cherry on the top in this movie and if he werent in this movie the movie would have lacked something for sure. There are scenes and lines that you will never forget in this movie and I have commented on hundreds of movies but very few I gave the full 10 out of 10 and this movie is one of those few.positive,This movie is one of those ones that makes you think really deep about life your life Morgan Freeman makes us feel the sadness and Tim Robbins the faith in a dark atmosphere.positive,This movie is one of the best movies Ive ever seen. It has comedy suspense action everything you could want in a movie. This movie is brilliant It may be the single best movie ever This movie has the best casts assembled ever from Samuel L. Jackson to John Travolta to Bruce Willis. Then how viewers are taken through a journey of 3 stories that all intertwine together. Nothing is predictable through the movie like most movies are. Quentin Tarantino is an directs this movie amazingly. This movie is a all-time classic that you could watch 100 times and never get bored of it. The first time I watched it I watched it about 10 more times right after that because it was so good.positive,This movie is one of the best Ive seen if not the best I feel Mr Jackson should have gotten an Oscar nomination for his role as Jules Forest Gumps Tom Hanks wouldnt have stood a chance  John Travoltas performance was good but could not beat Samuel L Jacksons portrayal of Jules the hitman I liked the scenes being presented asynchronously giving the sense of peoples worlds being connected but they the characters not really being aware of the interconnectivity of their lives roles The violence in the movie is not gratuitous hope Im using this word correctly  the car scene was especially good as was the cleaning of the car scene  dialogue excellent  and getting medieval on your ass will forever be with us  also going over this neighborhood with a blow torch and a pliers  What I also liked was the realism of the movie  I mean no cops around when you need them  in another movie the screen would have been swamped by blue and whites but not here  just pure unadulterated violence positive,This movie is one of the best I have ever seen. I first read the book and I didnt liked it that much but then I saw the movie. And thats a things thats never happened to me before the movie was better than the book. Its the other way normally. But in this case the movie is so much better I like the end more than in the book. Watch the movie it is great.  but if you pay attention you shall see what he mean. In fact all the hole charm of Tarantino is his way of make a good plot showing little details and thats make this unique at all. You can know all the hole life of the character just listening well the dialogs in the movie...and this is fantastic in a strange way. Well my last word is: WATCH positive,This movie is one of my all time favorites. Undoubtedly one of the most brilliant movies I have ever seen. Story cast screenplay all are great. The directing by Frank Darabont was just magnificent. The amazing casting of both Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins is amazing and couldnt be more accurate. It was narrated by Morgan Freeman who is the best narrator in Hollywood I believe. Actually the film depends on the story and the way in which it unravels. It will change the way u think about things around u. Surely It will teach you one thing that it is easy to take away a mans bread even his freedom but impossible to take away his hope. I can say with confidence this is the best movie I have ever seen - or ever will see. If you havent watch it yet just GO Watch it Now  you couldnt just hold off on the rest of the series if The Fellowship of the Ring didnt pan out financially. The emotional payoff of the film is testament to the work on all ends of production for everything from the script to the on-screen talent to the set decorators to the sound designers creates the aura of authenticity that makes this fantasy feel so real and convincing while also pulling us along on an emotional journey in which we feel so heavily invested by the time Frodo and Sam reach the summit of Mt. Doom. As with their journey in the story once youve gone this far as a viewer youre incredibly committed to the outcome and what an outcome. Bravo. ~Steven C Thanks for reading Visit moviemusereviews.com positive,This movie is not your ordinary Hollywood flick. It has a great and deep message. This movie has a foundation and just kept on being built on from their and that foundation is hope. Other than just the message of this movie the acting was phenomenal. Tim Robbins gave one of the greatest performances ever. He was inspiring intelligent and most of all positive. His performance just made me smile. Robbins plays Andy Dufresne who was wrongfully convicted of murdering his wife and her lover. He is gets to life sentences but yet never gives up hope. In he becomes friends with Ellis Boyd Red Redding played by Morgan Freeman. Freeman who gives the finest performance of his career has unlike Robbins lost hope. He is in deep regret of the crime that he committed. His way of deflecting the pain away is by trying to not feel anything at all. With his friendship with Andy he learns that without our hopes and dreams we have nothing. Andy also becomes friends with the rest of Reds group. James Whitmore also gave a great performance as Brooks Halten who gets out of prison parole but in the words of Red he has been institutionalized. The directing by Frank Darabont was just magnificent. He kept this movie at a great steady pace along with the writing and great cinematography. He portrayed prison life in such a horrifying way but not in terms of the physical pain but the stress and pain that wares mentally on the inmates some of which deserve a second chance. Whatever you do dont listen to the people who say this movie is overrated because this is one of the most inspiring and greatest movies ever. It has everything you could possibly want.positive,This movie is more than just a movie this is about freedom and peace between each other many people will learn something watching it about how the mind could be free when your body is not... ThatÎ‚s all I have to say about the greatest movie of all times thanks if you have read my comments D@vepositive,This movie is like no other I can say Drama action fantasy Probably one of the 20 best movie of all time Many good actors on the cast great music and special effects...

But thats to optimistic:positive,This movie is just the pinnacle of movie-making From the bizarre yet believable situations to the dialogs between characters there is probably no other movie where I enjoy myself more The story is non- linear but the thing is is that it doesnt bother the viewer at all The legendary opening the legendary ending the quotes the soundtrack the performances this might just at well be considered the perfect me To me it is I rarely give a movie 10/10 but Pulp Fiction is the movie that deserves it because there is no possible way you could improve it On a personal note there is something about this movie that truly makes me nostalgic Although it is stuffed with violent and nihilistic themes this movie is like a big goodbye to the good times and an in-your-face times will never bee this cool againpositive,This movie is just beyond great. Everything about it was pitch perfect. The acting was fantastic especially from Ledger and Bale . Bale and Ledger just worked so well together in the scenes that they were in. Ledger was the perfect Joker. He had the ability to be as dark as the people wanted to see from Joker he had the voice the tone and the look of Joker. He was able to bring the best out of everyone that he was in a scene with and that is what made him a true highlight of the movie. It will be very hard to find someone that can portray Joker quite like him. Now on to Bale. Christian Bale was as good of a Batman as one can be. Not only was he great as Batman but also as Bruce Wayne. Bale was the best Bruce Wayne that I have seen in my time of being a Batman fan  which is a very long time . Now I know that some might disagree with that but im sticking to my statement. The next reboot of Batman will have a lot of pressure to top not just this trilogy but just this movie.positive,This movie is just as great as the three before it. The camera angles lighting and effects were amazing. I am so proud of the actors Viggo Orlando Elijah Ian and everyone else Without this amazing cast Lord Of the Rings would not feel the way it does. Andy Serkis props to you for your amazing portrayal of Gollum and all the effort to get all those jumping shots in. The camera crew showed their worth with the excellent filmography. Ever angle gave meaning and ever sound effect chilled you with pride. With all these factors I feel proud to be alive when beautiful films like this are made for us to enjoy. Intense nostalgia grabs me when I watch this film now and I couldnt be more happier.positive,This movie is great it has everything in it. Fantastic acting by all actors and actresses. The Dark Knight is darkgrandiose and mad and hugely entertaining. The screenplay is really awesome from the start to the end I love heath ledger as The Joker and Christian Bale as Batman every time those come on screen together it gives me goosebumps. I liked Batman Begins and Dark Knigt Rises to but this is absolutely a master piece from Christopher Nolan. Nolan totally smashed the trilogy from the 90s. For me this is one of the best movies ever made I hope you all enjoy the movie RIP Heath Ledgerpositive,This movie is excellent Why Most importantly it is original It can be said quite accurately that many elements of this film have been stolen from other films No one can ever accuse Quentin Tarantino of not doing his homework Repo Man or La Femme Nikita as obvious examples He even rips off much of his own material from Reservoir Dogs But the manner in which these elements are chosen and assembled is both inspired and original Many people have stated that Pulp Fiction has been proven great by the amount of imitation that it spawned Frankly I dont think imitation proves anything AND I dont think Pulp Fiction was imitated significantly more than many other highly successful films However to my mind Pulp Fiction is great because it manages to recycle a multitude of pop culture icons that were seemingly over-used to death and somehow put them all together into something fresh and interesting Pulp Fiction also has a few truly original moments Christopher Walkens wonderfully dry delivery of the Your father kept this watch in his ass for years story is hilarious There is only one serious flaw in this film: Quentin Tarantino is a very poor actor Thank god he confined himself to a small role If he really feels the need to be onscreen he should just go ahead and pull a Hitchcockian cameo in his films Sure its derivative but at least his screen presence will be minimizedpositive,this movie is excellent and it has some great special effects the acting was also good i got sucked into the movie right from the start thats what i call moviemagic theres not many movies or producers can do this so big shoutout to christopher nolan i saw no flaws to the movie and the movie is very original i havent seen any movie like this before the idea is brand new for the movie and its perfect the question many people ask how will the earth and the humans be in 100 yearsor longer and i like how this movie shows possibilities over what can actually happen cause nobody has any idea whats happening in a 100 years i also like the more than 3 dimensional talk in it all in all its a good movie and i recommend a watch this movie gets 1010 from me because its a long movie with a lot of as i would like to call them tear scenes and joy scenes it brings you so far into the movie and its great written by johnpositive,This movie is epic. It takes the best of the book and increased to become something great. All the characters are well embedded the drama of each is well explored. Viggo Mortensen is the perfect Aragon. Better than fellowship of the ring. Better than the The two towers Tolkin rest in peace. Because your job of your life was not thrown in the trash Peter  you are the guy... This movie is epic.

I think the Joker made the movie with his new darker and scarier theme. Dont get me wrong Christian Bale also did an amazing job but Heath Ledger made it. It is very sad that Heath has passed but this movie will go on in history and I dont know about everyone else but I find this movie one of Heath Ledgers BEST movies I have seen. Just the fact that he did an amazing job playing the Joker and brought the character to life. I think thats what made it so amazing. If Heath were still here I think we all wouldve liked to see where his career wouldve went after this role.positive,This movie is based on a novella by Stephen King but dont let that put you off. Its not a horror film rather a thumpingly good ode to friendship hope wit wiles and wisdom brimming with crackling characters and topped with the most twister of twists since The Crying Game. Found guilty of killing his unfaithful wife and her lover in a fit of passion sullen accountant Andy Dufresne Robbins casting off his goof ball image to display more layers than the proverbial onion is shipped to the Gothic wind-swept corridors of the Shawshank State Prison for life. It is here the movie gracefully unfolds. With a beautifully rounded script writer/director Darabont conjures up a spellbinding personal odyssey stretching through the years from 1946 to 1967. Dufresne all the while protesting his innocence slowly overcomes the hellfire tortures of the prison system - an unblinking range of beatings rapings and abject humiliations - while managing to inspire his fellow inmates to lift their degraded horizons. Among them is Red Freeman in a matchless supporting role the lifer who can given time provide virtually anything. And for reasons best known to himself Dufresne requires 40s starlet Rita Hayworth provisioned in poster form. The mood swings rigorously through every emotion as the cranky wise guy and downright crazed array of criminals bare the brunt of the turbulent life within the doomy Shawshank catacomb. Then it gets really mean gearing up for its injury-time shockers. Dufresne a whiz with figures is bullied into running the wardens Gunton petty accounting scams giving him the chance to execute his and the films final greatest miracle. If youre miserable enough to look for gripes then yes it does drift on too long and who needs prison buggery again Yet the ending has such poetic completeness youre too busy contentedly chuckling to worry about sore behinds. This may have confounded American audiences - it flopped big-time on planet Yank - but a more divine movie experience you will not find this side of Oscardom. Spread the word.positive,This movie is an instant classic. Everything about it is perfect - the acting the special effects the plot the music and the complete and utter emotion it contains. It will be remembered for years to come and its story will be passed down for generations. I have seen hundreds and hundreds of movies and this one will always be my favorite. This is the movie I will show to my children and tell them how great it is until they tire of hearing about it from me. I have grown up reading the books and this movie did not disappoint. Nothing else has come close and nothing ever will. I hope for everyone to enjoy this movie and cherish it as I have and will. Kudos Peter Jackson. Continue to amaze and inspire us with your work.positive,This movie is a total proof that Christopher Nolan is actually a very forward director he claims the Batman franchise with a very unique and dark film about the most prolific hero of DC. And its not just about the direction of Nolan what makes this movie one of the best of all the times there are the stunning casting. Heath Ledger show us with that clever performance how to reinvent a character as the Joker which is one of the best villains ever made and he just add another element and history to him. Also Christian Bale performance is a highlight for me is the best Batman of all just because of the darkness in the voice and the capacity to show us the two parts of Bruce Wayne. Im not surprised that this film is in top 10 of the best films ever made because it captures all the single parts of an amazing film.positive,This movie is a must watch for any and every person no matter the race or gender. The only thing that is not good about this movie is that it has an end. Its quite depressing. I have watched this movie at least once a new year and ever road trip. Its very entertaining kills time inspiring awesome action scenes and the work on the Uruk-Hai and the other beasts is incredible. As with the first two the film is very long but goes by without you ever truly realizing it. This film is so much more than a simple fantasy epic. Its a story about strength of character friendship loyalty and love. And while every member of the Fellowship has their part to play I finally understood why some critics have said this series is a story about Sam. Its his unwavering resolve that led the quest to its victory. Sean Astin is a true credit for adding the inspirational heart to this epic. As as far as the ending goes they ended it the way that it had to be ended. Jackson ended this film the way it should have been. This is probably the best movie ever made. If there was a rating higher than 10 i would give it. EXCELLENT 10/10.positive,This movie is a masterpiece on every level All the references to McDonalds the cereal that was discontinued which Quentin has saved and put into the movie It is all a piece of American culture And coming from a guy from Europe I simply love all that brand stuff Following criminals in their daily lives hearing their dialog - is wonderful and it makes for a lot of wit It is bizarre contrast between murder and funny discussions The acting Well I think John Travolta was bad even tho he got critical acclaim But Samuel give the performance of his life The drugs I like that this movie didnt focus on sex It feels so cheap Instead it depicts a housewifes cocaine use Classy scenes of injecting top grade heroin It is all very stylish and really makes the movie sexy it didnt feel like a cheap trick It is morbid humor appealing to all of us mainstream moviegoers as well as for respected criticspositive,This movie Im not going to call this film the IMDb #1 movie but I really cant deny that this is fantastic. The cast the  the writing and the power are all here in this film and filled with strength. Its one of those movies that you will continue to think about even after the film is over. It is about a friendship a life an evil and a hope. A hope that is considered in many ways to be bridge to insanity inside the prison walls. We see these people as years of time goes by. We see friendships grow and topics change. It really puts you in the prison and makes you feel whats like to behind those bars. You feel the friendship the hope the darkness and the pure horror of it all. 4 stars out of 4positive,this movie hit it right out of the ball park for me reading all of these negative and cynical reviews has me stumped i thought this film was way better than i expected it to be even my dad who is quite a tough movie critic thoroughly enjoyed it although everyone is entitled to their opinion to me this movie is one i could watch over and over again and i highly recommend it its perfectly written and the acting is right up there along side the amazing script the movie flows together youre never wondering whats going on or have to worry about getting confused because its so detailed and thorough not to mention ben affleck serves as a nice piece of eye candy through out the film  for those of you second guessing watching this movie because of the many debbie downer reviews on here just give it a chance and come up with your own opinion of this filmpositive,this movie has the best movie ever made what more could you ask for.... great actors.... ews should focus on the titles content and context.

Every scene has its own story. I like the way Morgan freeman narrates in the movie which makes it all the more interesting. The scene where Andy gets beer for his coworkers. Also when he plays the two Italian singers on prison radio. Brooks last few days.And how Red comes to terms with his freedom. I recently watched it for the first time and cant believe how i could miss this for so long. I Also cant believe Morgan never won Oscar for this. I cant think of any better performance than this.Truly deserves the number one spot. Since last week i have watched it 3 times and plan to watch it again. Thank you Frank Darabont for giving us hope.positive,This movie has is all.. Good actors good story and a helluva speed all through the movie.. You will never be bored when watching this movie.. With so many good actors in one movie you could think that it would not be a good movie. But In my opinion This is the Best movie John Travolta & Laurent Fishbourne ever acted in.. They both are in their peak performance.. One very cool thing about this movie is that you may THINK that you know whats gonna happened next... But believe me you dont have a clue... I have seen this movie at least 50 times already.. And I could easily watch it 50 times more without getting bored.. It deserves a BIG 10/10.. If you havent seen it go get a copy immediately..positive,This movie has got to be one of the craziest films ever made. Including the all-star cast & the different story lines how it all comes together in the end so to speak is brilliant. First time I seen this I didnt know what I was in for but glad I did. Tarantino at his original best is still around the time this film was made. 5 Stars QT This is by far one of his best works Now lets just hope that Mr. Willis doesnt want to do a 2nd part to this ... that would be just scary. Dont know hoe wed be able to handle a all new version remake or sequel: Zeds Dead Baby ... wait no hes back as a Zombie :-positive,This movie has everything the final chapter of a trilogy needs it is absolutely amazing in every single aspect that i am finding it tough to even find one fault in it. The acting was astonishing right down to the all the bad ugly looking creaturesabsolutely amazing special effects and Peter Jackson deserves one big round of applause for this filming masterpiece. In this movie Frodo and SamAstin and Wood did amazing jobs considering to their roles and kept their friendship going and merry and pippin also played their roles amazingly well when they were handed bigger roles in this third and final installment of the trilogy.BloomDavies Reprised their roles exceedingly well and there is no movie at all without AragornViggo Mortensen.he did everything possible needed of him and he met each and every one of those expectations great job done their. Ian Mckellen also does a very good job and there was no movie if it was not for the special effects the battles were astonishing in this movies which makes me want to keep watching the movie over and over again. All said and done this is the finishing touch to an absolute masterpiece and the final block of the puzzle to The Lord Of The Rings Trilogy.The acting was made to perfection and if i was given the chance i will praise this movie over and over again together with the previous two movies. This movie provides entertainment to every person around and it deserves the credit it gets. Overall i will give this movie a 10/10. An unforgettable masterpiece in my opinion.positive,This movie has everything great actors fun action and awesome dialogue. The only thing this movie is missing is a theme which in my opinion adds to the fact that this movie rocked my world. You dont have to think too much about it it may take you a few times to watch it to appreciate it though. The first time i watched this movie the only thing i was thinking when it was over was WHATTTT The second time i watched it it turned into my favorite movie. I really cant explain why i like the movie so much it just sort of stuck with me. John Travolta and Sam Jackson are incredible they show what hit men talk about when they arent killing people. Uma Thurman is cheezy and perfect for her role as the hit mens bosss wife. Simply put this movie is incredible but it may take you two viewings. Ten stars from me.  Pulp is a throwback to those crime cereals that were so prolific in newspapers and comic books of the 70s as well as a throwback to the classic mobster movies many of us grew up with. Some people see this as a weakness to Quentin Tarantinos direction saying that hes limited to only making homages to other things in popular culture. I dont think thats true personally but in my opinion its one of his strengths. He takes a genera that is well known and popular and gives it a very fresh twist. He did that with Pulp and he continues to do it today with films like Kill Bill and Inglourious Basterds. Boiling Pulp Fiction itself down however the true lovers of cinema the people who will know exactly what Tarantino is referencing or paying homage to are the ones who will get the most out of this film. That is however not to say that casual viewers wont like the film. It has a little something for everybody and is without a doubt one of the best films of the recent generation. I hope you like this review and take it into consideration if you decide to see the film. positive,This movie has a great plot and good acting the characters are fantastic and the action sequences are impressive. Subtle plot points may be missed easily so you have to watch the movie again to get the full plot. However realism is another storypositive,this movie guardians of the galaxy is a marvel movie about 5 space criminals who works together in order to stop ronan the accuser in destroying the entire galaxy these comics were only known by few people it became famous when the actors were announced to play each of their characters it became more famous when the trailer and the movie was released the movie was liked by everyone and this movie is very excellent you will enjoy this movie for sure unlike other marvel movies there were jump scenes unlike here there wasnt any and this movie is also a funny movie and even the after end credit scenes dont miss all the fun in guardians of the galaxypositive,This movie doesnt deserve a 10 it deserves a 11... This is the best movie I ever saw everything on the movie is great the story the acting the message just everything. I spoke with so many people that saw this movie and everyone of them said that The Shawshak Redemption is a truly masterpiece. If someone is reading this- please stop reading and go and watch the movies if you havent yet because you will see one of the best movies ever made in human history. It is the best rated movie 9.2 and when I see that rating Im just asking myself why is there just a 9.2 instead of a 10positive,This movie despite the fact that I have now seen it more than 20 times never gets old and certainly never fails to impress The actors show just how talented they are and how much they are capable of The scenes might seem to not make sense in the order they are in during the first time you watch it but I assure you that after a second or maybe even third time everything will fall into place and amaze you This movie basically has no flaws and demonstrates how amazing the art of cinematography can be Many people underestimate the skill and class it takes to create such a movie but it is blindingly obvious that this film belongs in the top 100 best movies of all time in everyones mind This is my opinion on the film it might seem overrated to you because i am a huge Quentin Tarantino fan but this movie left my mouth wide open and i cannot do otherwise but recommend itpositive,This movie defines excellence in the field of comic book heroes and in the field of cinema. Its a crime that this film wasnt nominated for best picture because it clearly was the best film of the decade. No other comic book hero will ever surpass this film because you cant beat perfection and this movie is perfection. I can say that i have seen the dark knight at least twenty times and my life and yes at times it gets boring but i keep watching because i love watching perfect films. If i see this movie come on television i always record or watch it. I wont skip out on that. It will be hard to make another batman story with the fact that Christopher Nolan has changed comic book movies forever with this one filmpositive,This movie completes the series perfectly Jackson is a genius. This movie is a must watch for any and every person no matter the race or gender. The only thing that is not good about this movie is that it has an end. Its quite depressing. I have watched this movie at least once a new year and ever road trip. Its very entertaining kills time inspiring awesome action scenes and the work on the Uruk-Hai and the other beasts is incredible. I only hope they make a remake that is even better than this movie if thats possible. All those haters who say that this movie is boring then they are missing the point and i would love to see what movies they find interesting. If there was a rating higher than 10 i would give it hands down. OVERALL = AMAZING 10/10positive,This movie captures many of things that made us love movies in the first place It is a movie that contains many beautiful messages about life in general and how we should always be grateful for what we have its about friendship its about dedication and determination It teaches that we can find beauty in the most difficult situations and places. I rated this movie 10/10 because I seriously couldnt find any flaw the direction script acting production values and acting. What I like about this movie is thats all about humans its about the simple human needs that we seek freedom love respect power friendship health fairness and justice. This movie is great because it can reach to any human being regardless of their background or history or preference it will touch you so deeppositive,This movie can be put into so many words but heres just one...EXCELLENT. Once again Christopher Nolan teams up with the wonderful Christian Bale with also some other new characters like The Joker which is definitely the best Villain I have ever witnessed in my life. Heath Ledger1978-2008 gives his best performance ever in this movie totally Oscar worthy. Harvey Dent which is played wonderfully by Aaron Eckhart especially when he becomes Two-Face. And then we have Maggie Gyllenhaal who gives a terrific performance as Bruce Waynes love Rachel Dawes. Please do go see this film you will be very glad you did.positive,This movie by far is the best cult fiction movie ever made streamlined performance of Samuel L Jackson makes it a wonderful dark thriller of ages by far known as the era of amateur crime becoming professional in a way A must watch in any movies list before you die Epic thriller of all time and the twists in plots with an ultimate climax takes the movie into the very next level a true entertainer of sorts with a great impact on the box office in those time it is one of the highly rated movies of all time and a well directed acted produced combination The in depth realisation of each character is another strong point of this film with major emphasis given on the lead actors the movie takes a good support from the female actors who helps in the building up of the story The supporting role are well organised and created intellectually the contribution from each department of the movie is prominent and locations of shooting and storyline settings are well taken care about The movie has won much appreciations and great audience support and is still a celebrated movie worldwide The movie can be guided into the record books as the very literature of film makingpositive,This movie brings back lots of great memories so im biased anyway... Nevertheless a lot of People feel the same way about this piece. Im sure of that. The return of the King sums the trilogy up more than nicely. So well done. With lots of blood sweat and tears put into it. You feel it by watching it. Lesnies Cinematography is a perfect fit for the Epic Landscapes and the breathtaking Visual effects. I have to mention that i never read the book but from a movie standpoint the story works just fine for me. And even to i may have overseen some goofs here and there it all makes sense in the end. For those that havent had the pleasure to watch it in cinemasi recommend getting the Extended Version DVD The one with all three movies included. The included making of is one of the best made behind the scenes looks out there.positive,This movie blew me away One word to some it all up is Refreshing Thats what this movie was to me Finally something different original but intelligent The way the story is told the dialogue the cast  Everything was right on the money The movie is filed with classic scenes memorable quotes and unforgettable characters I recommend this film to everyone who wants to see something fresh Beware you must open minded fallow the story But dont worry even if its told in a special way it isnt avant-garde to the point where its impossible to understand it I just hope that Tarantino can come up with the magic again I was disappointed with Jackie Brown I cannot blame him Not every movie could be masterpiecepositive,This movie and the whole trilogy deserves all the praise it has received. I had been worried about seeing it because of how much Peter Jackson re-wrote Two Towers and presented scenes that undermined some of Tolkiens fundamental ideas. This time Jackson followed Tolkien more closely and the worst that can be claimed are sins of omission. Its a real shame we didnt get to see Christopher Lee in this movepositive,This movie and indeed all the Lord of the Rings movies is the best that I have ever seen. In fact I wouldnt consider this a movie because generally when I watch a movie its just entertainment for me not something to be remembered and thought of long after Ive watched it. This masterpiece of film-making this beautiful moving incredible conclusion to a trilogy which held me in amazement from the battle at the plains of Gorgoroth to the Ringbearers passing at the Grey Havens is perhaps the best adaptation of a book ever. If you are perhaps reading this comment having not seen the movies buy them and watch them now. The best way to watch them is not one after another quickly without time to reflect on each one but one evening after another with time to appreciate and understand Tolkiens masterpiece. Ive seen the comments on this movie few as they are which nearly all say that they loved the books and hated the movies giving various reasons as to why. Ill give you a few examples. 1. The characters werent developed at all. Im sorry The actors and actresses from the movies were all incredible doing what they were best at amazingly well. Ian McKellen the actor who played Gandalf does one of perhaps the best performances Ive ever seen. Elijah Wood as Frodo understands the effect the Ring has on the hobbit and shows that knowledge to create a moving performance of an individual struggling against a power that is too great to bear. I could go on but its not necessary. Every single character in that film is as well developed as anyone would be in real life. 2. The Scouring of the Shire was not shown. I can give a completely logical explanation for this. In the book near to the end of ROTK Frodo and Sam destroy the Ring and Sauron and all evil is defeated. The hobbits weary of all their adventures and sorrows return home to find that Saruman and Wormtongue have taken over the Shire and are forced to defeat them as well. Now to me and most other people that have read the books this is seen as a huge anticlimax. Think about it in movie form. The audience having watched an amazing three hours of film are now ready for the end. Then suddenly Saruman pops out of nowhere and has almost ruined the Shire. In the books this is acceptable because it shows that evil can come to the most good of places. But this has already been shown many times in other parts of the book like Lothlorien Fangorn and Ithilien to some extent. 3. Too much CGI. I can answer this criticism fairly quickly. Imagine if there was little or no CGI in the Lord of the Rings movies. All it would be would be close up shots of the actors and places with maybe a few actors in prosthetic makeup. This would never give the sense of scale necessary for the books. For the places and things Tolkien describes you need CGI and I cannot see how anyone could possibly criticise that. 4. Not true to the books SO WHAT Any movie that you see that is based on a book is never and I repeat never completely and utterly true to the book. Peter Jackson took these masterpieces of literature and turned them into masterpieces of film-making and people who say they werent true to the books are sometimes right but the films must be seen as works of art in their own right. Actually the love story between Aragorn and Arwen is used in the movies and fitted in perfectly with the rest whereas Tolkien put this in the appendices. There arent other any major criticisms that I can find apart from petty things like they sucked and I walked out 30 minutes before the end. These comments are not worthy of argument mainly because they are made by people that probably have never seen the sun. Sorry about that but it had to be said. Still there are just some people who dont like fantasy and dont like these films. Fine I can respect that. But really these films arent just fantasy. Theyre a story that has enchanted generations a tale of war peace beauty good evil friendship hope fear and love that would work in any genre. I challenge any film-maker to surpass these films ever again and Im sure that in fifty years these films will still be popular with people watching them in goggles in 3D blu-ray. Just speculating Anyway for me these films are incredible. Nothing more to be said.positive,This isnt just a fancy superhero movie...Its beyond that. It deserves every amount of praise lavished onto it. Putting aside the plot and the taking the performances of everyone involved in the movie are beyond excellence. Christopher Nolan is as usual at his BEST. Nolan strikes with his Non- linear storytelling in his own style. We will be blown with his sublime work. This is definitely the sequel we deserved. Christian Bale and Heath Ledger were phenomenal. The Joker has made evil look so good... This is the first film I know where the Joker who plays a negative role had such a positive impact on the film.positive,This is without doubt my favourite film The acting casting soundtrack story and direction are in my opinion second to none It is violent and thats not why I enjoyed it so much although I can see why some would not like the film because of the excess of the violence but it is funny moving and had me on the edge of my seat throughout Youve got to see it at least once maybe not as much as I have watched it possibly or you are missing outpositive,This is without a doubt one of the finest films of the last 20 years. I think that if it had been released with more fanfare and didnt have such great competition that year it might have won for Best Picture. This film has such a powerful presence that it has a life of its own apart from the cast  cinematography etc. all of which are deservedly great. This is one of those movies that you can switch to when you are channel surfing and stop and watch the rest of it no matter what part of the movie you are at. Perhaps The Godfather and Jaws are a couple of others that do that for me and it never gets old no matter how many times you watch it. One thing that disappoints me regarding this film is what has happened to the director Frank Darabont. Unfortunately he has never come close to achieving the greatness of Shawshank with his subsequent films. I thought The Green Mile was good but it didnt hold a candle to Shawshank. I was also very disappointed in The Mist. I sincerely hope that he is able to recapture some of the magic of Shawshank Redemption in a future film because he definitely does have the proved ability to do so.positive,this is without a doubt one of my favorite films of all time ill never forget watching this film for the first time with a good buddy of mine afterward we couldnt stop talking about it and spent a great deal of time explaining plot points to each other we finally decided that we just had to see it again so we did and all of our questions were answered and our theories proven correct the story is nothing less than superb every time you think you have the movie figured out they throw you for another loop but not too much as to get you irritated trying to figure out the plot this is most definitely a film that deserves at least two viewings before you can truly understand and appreciate the story the characters are all excellent as well although i was sad to see jack harmen emilio estevez get killed off so quickly i liked his character the cast is extraordinary tom cruise plays ethan hunt perfectly jon voight was the perfect choice for jim phelps emmanuelle beart was very good in her role henry czerny was superb as kittridge jean reno was an excellent addition to the cast ving rhames was a very nice touch and really added a lot to the film kristin scott thomas was lovely as always although played a somewhat minor role in the greater scheme of things vanessa redgrave was another nice addition to the cast and finally emilio estevez as i mentioned above played a small role and played it quite well i can see why some of the big fans of the show wouldnt like this film due to certain plot points that i cant give away so if you are a big fan of the show be forewarned you may have some issues with the film personally ive never seen a single episode of the old television show so i had absolutely no frame of reference which i believe put me in a better position to appreciate the story i feel that i have to mention the action scenes in this film spectacular the scene where kittridge and hunt are talking in the restaurantjust awesome the entire last 20 minutes of the filmunbelievable the filming the action the special effects and stunts alone make this film worth watching but luckily there is so much more to appreciate if you are a fan of tom cruise or just crimemysteryaction films in general be sure to check this one out at least twice this is honestly one of my top 20 films of all time i truly hope that you will enjoy this film thanks for reading chrispositive,This is without a doubt my favorite movie. Every time I see this movie I feel touched by its magic. Most of my friends have seen it because I have recommended them to do it and they have all loved it. Robbins Freeman and Whitmores characters are the ones that I like the most. It is just stupid unfair and shameful that this wonderful movie was not awarded neither at The Oscars nor The Golden Globes. The IMBD voters have it at #2. My hope is to see it in the future at #1.positive,this is what im always looking for in a movie amazing and thoughtprovoking script finely detailed and imaginative cinematography and cgi inspired and believable acting and a soundtrack hans zimmer that connects viewers with the story adding tension passion soul scouring drama and pause through well crafted music unlike many science fiction movies interstellar goes the extra light year to bring home the themes of family loss unfathomable exploration and dimensions beyond our scope of reality leave everything at home and experience this tremendous work of art hell make it a holiday present to yourself and everyone you know i know there are a lot of excellent movies that will be released between now and the end of the year but this is an absolute must seepositive,This is truly a masterpiece This is a movie based off a comic book but never was you felt like you are reading a comic book. The movie is so grounded in reality that make you feel like you are in this living world where batman himself can save you. There are many thing that make this movie great. Batman he is a crime-fighting hero like any hero he is selfless. He endure pain for other people. He lives by day as a playboy but by night he swing justice to everyone. He is smart skillful selfless and terrifying. He is the dark knight. Harvey Dent he is a lawyer like any lawyer he bring justice to Gotham. But deferent from batman he dont where mask he already fighting justice. He is smart talented charming and brave. He is the Gotham white knight. The Joker he is the villain of the story like any villain he bring chaos to the table. He break people and bring fear to them just like Batman. He evil smart terrifying and manipulative. These three unique character bring different aspect to the movie. All three can not live without the other and all three are in constant conflict. Batman need of Harvey to be the face Gotham deserve Harvey need of Batman to help him with his work the Joker need both of them to make a point. This create a thicken plot packed with action crime drama make for a thrilling experience. This is the movie where people would look back 10-20 years from now and say its a classic. I could spend my hole week watching this movie and i can still find somethings new. If you have not seen this movie give it a shot you will now regret it.positive,this is the second best scifi movie i have watched the first one i absolutely fell in love was the avatar oh i do love those movies the guardians of the galaxy has everything action drama humor it is simply worth watching the storyline is very interesting it is indeed great to watch the creation of someone who has put it on the screen i admire the way the actors play simply amazing i honestly was surprised that vin diesel was the voice of groot and actually after behind the scenes videos i discovered that lee pace is actually ronan amazing how sometimes you cannot even recognize some wonderful personalities really those who havent managed to see it  you must watch enjoy the moviepositive,This is the only movie I would give 10 out of 10 for. This movie has got everything a movie needs: Great acting and great actors an amazing storyline superb music a perfect movie length and a fantastic ending. This movie deserves all the credit it gets. It is my favourite movie of all time and always will be. This movie has changed my life.  while it doesnt have the innocence of Reservoir Dogs or the maneuverability of the Kill Bill series it definitely stands on its own. It is also one of the more charming and highly appealing of the Generation X stoner flicks. Let me just say that if I could give this movie beyonder points Id give it a 16 for eerily supernatural. Great great work. positive,This is the greatest movie of all time. From the dialog to the story. Has some of the greatest characters and some of the most emotional moments. Has one of the greatest and most underrated soundtracks ever. There is a big reason this movie won 11 Oscarsshould of won 12 for Sean Astins incredible performance and it should have been nominated for another for Andy Serkiss Smeagol outstanding performance in the beginning scene of The Return of the King. It has the best writing of all time and is just such an amazing movie. Never gets old I have seen the movie 5 times just in the past year. Peter Jackson is a genius and J.R.R Tolkien is a God. The characters are so amazing. Aragorn: The most humble character who led an army to victory and helped Middle Earth be saved. His battle speech is one of my favorite speeches of all time and his line For Frodo was epic. In the ending of The Return of the King when he said to the hobbits You bow to no one was just so powerful and amazing. He is one of my favorite characters in this film for sure. Gollum/Smeagol: Corrupted by the power of the ring and cant control it is amazing and his two separate personalities are different. That one scene in the very beginning of The Return of the King was just awesome. When he kills his friend Deagol for the ring. Gandalf: One of the greatest characters ever. So amazing how he pretty much saved the whole of middle earth. YOU SHALL NOT PASS was epic and how he came back to life to finish off his mission was amazing. Merry/Pippin: The lovable funny twins brought entertainment every time they were on screen. Merrys stupidity is hilarious. How courageous such a small person can be was amazing Samwise: My favorite character in any movie or bookother than Severus Snape. The greatest friend anyone can ever have. His amazing speech in two towers touched everyone. He should have won an Oscar or at least been nominated. He is amazing in The Return of the King when he is telling Frodo about the Shire and his sadness when Frodo decides to keep the ring. When he saved Frodo from the spider and from the tower in Mordor was so epic. He is the friend everyone should have.positive,This is the greatest film Ive ever seen. American Beauty and North by Northwest come pretty close but then again I havent seen Citizen Kane yet. Theres not much I can say about the film that wont give away something so Ill just give it my unequivocal endorsement. Close the blinds open your mind and watch this film preferably four or five times so everything becomes clearer.positive,This is the great movie that i ever see in the Batman movie series. Although there are some parts which i never expect before. Like at the end the movie indicate a new hero will come to this comic character on the next part. It was really exciting. Though my opinion is solidifying already after having seen a Warner Bros. screening last night Dark Knight ably stands on its own with or without Batman Begins. At a two and a half hour runtime its definitely an epic of a movie but one that never runs out of gas. A delightful addition to this experience was a healthy amount of IMAX footage which significantly adds to the feel of being on a personal and gruesome tour of Gotham City. Christian Bale plays such a well rounded Batman and Bruce Wayne qualities that none of those who have donned the cowl before him have pulled off. I still have to remember that Bale is British since he speaks with such a spot on American accent. Bale has a particular slurring lisp that serves him quite well charmingly for Bruce Wayne and threateningly for Batman. Countering him is the late Heath Ledger who plays such a scary and creepy Joker that I found it impossible to NOT have chills half the time I saw him on screen. What really separates this brand of Joker from Jack Nicholsons portrayal is true unpredictability. Its obvious that to be a good guy and think like the Joker it really takes a toll and it sure isnt easy. How exactly does one take him down when hes woven his harebrained plot around multiple hostages explosives or disappearing parlor tricks Initially I was uneasy about how the character of Harvey Dent would be handled. In my mind there was really only one faithful portrayal of him and that could be found in the Batman animated series of the early 90s. As well as Tommy Lee Jones COULD have handled him in Batman Forever he certainly did not though it still was a highlight of that movie. Aaron Eckhart ably assumes the mantle here delivering a performance out of this world easily on par with the Batman animated series.positive,this is the first time i am really wand to write something about this movie even though i have watched it a hundred times o so anyone who really wanna know how a movie should b should watch this one movies are medium which should make us think and this one surely does about life anyone wanna know the meaning of patience determination this one does the trick for u watch it and be inspired thats all i can say it will change the way u think about things around u never let it die in upositive,This is the first Batman movie thats not about Batman. Its no traditional yarn about a protagonist fighting a villain with audiences hoping the hero beats the bad guy. On the contrary its a thrilling story about the cost of heroism and seduction by evil. Tim Burton explored anti-hero themes with Michelle Pfeiffers brooding Catwoman in Batman Returns and although Burton failed to flesh it out many people agree Catwoman was the best part of that film. Director Christopher Nolan knows better having demonstrated a Hitchcockian mastery of psychology with themes of guilt Insomnia and competition The Prestige. In his film we meet Joker a chilling Heath Ledger a sociopath with a taste for anarchy. He doesnt want revenge or power. In one scene he burns a mountain of cash. The mobsters call him crazy and before he cuts them to pieces he mutters Its not about money. Its about sending a message. Right away we know he isnt a villain we can predict or understand. Consequently hes pretty terrifying. Ledgers Joker is so compelling that he has the best lines and the most memorable scenes. Usually we watch superhero films to see how the protagonist overcomes the villain. But in The Dark Knight we strangely cheer as the Joker kicks ass at robbing banks manipulating the mob and even destroying a hospital. Strangely enough we walk away from the experience not wanting to be Batman. We want to be Joker. But thats not what I mean when I say this movie isnt about Batman. Its actually about DA Harvey Dent Aaron Eckhart whose strong performance will be overshadowed by Ledgers. He is Gothams White Knight and his tragedy revolves around an anecdote told early in the film about the Roman who guards his city not out of power lust but of civic duty-- to which his girlfriend and Assistant DA Rachel Dawes Maggie Gyllenhaal wisely refutes Dont forget the last man given that duty was named Caesar. Here lies the central theme-- a man holds power until death or long enough to see himself become the villain. Its deep stuff for a Batman movie but it works extremely well. Many may leave the film wondering why but it has to do with what we missed from Star Wars Episode III. Although were horrified by Jokers mind whose villainy rivals Anthony Hopkins Hannibal Lecter we cant help but be strangely drawn to his eerie confidence manic charisma and unstoppable power. Due to some grueling and unexpected events Dent falls from grace and becomes seduced by Jokers evil. Lets not forget Batman who is common-denominator but not centerpiece to the war between Dent and Joker. Dent proclaims Batman as Gothams hero but others dont agree-- including Bruce Wayne. Wayne is still a jealous self-absorbed and emotionally tortured brat in many ways as we learned from Batman Begins. He doesnt see himself as a hero. And although he despises Dent for stealing Rachel away from him he deeply admires him. Here we draw the dichotomy of White Knight Dent and Dark Knight Batman. Bruce Wayne knows that he cant have Rachel unless he gives up Batman forever. But theres a pain within him that keeps him out at night fighting his personal demons. He loves Rachel the same way Dent loves Rachel but he wont give up being Batman. Bruce Wayne is not a noble self-sacrificing hero. He has his cake and wants to eat it too. Equally Dent wants to fight a hard line with crime. Hes incorruptible unwilling to compromise doing it for principles of righteousness rather than personal glory. He too refuses to be a hero. But unlike Batman he is self-sacrificing fighting in broad daylight in full vulnerability even if it puts him and his loved ones at risk. Dont worry-- Nolan never lets this character drama drag the story. The movie is wall-to-wall action with sensational stunt sequences that exceed any prior Batman film primarily because it uses very few digital effects. Its got a gritty organic feel of urban combat like Michael Manns Heat which brought us into a downtown LA war-zone where gunshots echo off the walls of buildings. As we witness a chase between an 18-wheeler and a SWAT truck we know its actually happening. Many filmmakers neglect what Steven Spielberg calls geography and consequent quick-cutting and stylistic shots make the viewer lose their sense of setting. But Nolan keeps things very real using helicopter shots and wide-angle lenses the way he did with prior films that depended on atmosphere Insomnia The Prestige. Most people familiar with the comics know that Dent becomes the villain Two-Face. But Nolan makes a statement with Dents transformation to evil. Harvey Dent succumbs to crime because his life has endured tragedy and everything hes stood for has fallen to pieces. Meanwhile Joker isnt so much a villain as a sardonic force of nature reminiscent of Javier Bardems Anton Chigurh in No Country for Old Men. For most of the movie Batman merely assists Dent in his war on evil. But in the end Batman takes the fall for Two-Faces crimes allowing Dents legacy to live on. In this he truly becomes The Dark Knight because he allows the White Knight to triumph. Even though evil has apparently won the battle Batman refuses to allow evil to win the war. I think many people write off superhero movies assuming they dont hold literary merit-- this was the case with Burtons zany Batman and Joel Schumachers cartoon-like Batman. I hope The Dark Knight proves that such a belief is untrue. Check out the original comics or the animated series and youll see theres a lot more being said with these characters. The Joker is not funny like Jack Nicholson or Cesar Romero. Hes scary. Hes scarier because he doesnt take the world seriously. Fortunately the film takes itself seriously and its one of the best in recent years.positive,This is the film to define our generation Tarantino has set a standard in movie making for the next 20 years pretty much like Hitchcock did for his time This movie a real pleasure to watchpositive,This is the best The dialog between actors was great Absence of a single staring role was very appreciated all the character parts were diversify unique and all were developed appropriately Every seen had an unexpected twist yet never leaving you confused or trying to lead the audience astray I was completely absorbed never finding a dull moment or having time to try and figure out what was coming next This is unequivocally the best movie of the decade I saw it twicepositive,This is the best of the Dark Knight trilogy in my opinion. Heath Ledger is fantastic as The Joker also I feel he kind of gets put in the back burner but Aaron Eckharts Harvey Dent/ Two Face is also fantastic and the special effects on his face are incredible. Bale will always be my favourite Batman and this story is brilliant especially the tension between the two boats at the end. Kind of annoying they changed the actor of the Rachel character only to have her go and get killed but thats only one small gripe in an otherwise perfect film. Id also like to mention the fantastic opening sequence in the bank that has to be one of my favourite scenes in any film hopefully the second Man Of Steel film will be as fantastic as this second Dark Knight moviepositive,This is the best movie Ive ever seen. It has everything  picture jumps round but in the same time gathers the plot in to one piece. Pulp is cult. positive,This is the best movie I have ever seen. In a way I feel I am in a prison of life myself. Restricted to doing certain things. Sometimes I get frustrated and feel as I should runaway to some place where I could feel free. I hope and dream for it sometime. This movie just reminds me of my feelings so much. I love Andy Dufresne most in this movie. Although critics say Tim Robbins didnt do enough to express the character but my personal opinion is that he was made for this role. I can go on and say more but I said the most important thing which I feel whenever I watch it. I am glad to visit IMDb. I never heard of it before. Some 7 years ago I saw it at no.2 in the rankings and decided to watch it immediately. Only other movie which even comes close to this is Citizen Kane. But that is about past and this one is about hope and freedom. I give it 11/10.positive,this is the best movie i have ever seen how can you hate it the acting is stunning its silly the best i think is bale batman this movie is great batman Gordon and dent fight to keep crime of the streets until the joker comes in and ruins every thing he slowly brings mayhem to Gotham city all hope is gone can batman save the day while dent loses his sanity sadly heath ledger died before this movie could be done kind of overrated his performance but great this movie is the soul reason why Im a batman fan i wish they sold the comics here oh well more reading wigs for me also good is Morgan freeman as fox and Aaron as dent so far my only good review go to my page to see my other reviewspositive,This is the best movie ever but I give you 15 Things You May Not Have Known About The Shawshank Redemption 1. Its Based on a Novella by Stephen King The film is based on Stephen Kings novella Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption which was published in a short story collection called Different Seasons. Two of the other short stories in the collection were made into films Stand By Me in 1986 and Apt Pupil in 1998. Only one of them The Breathing Method has not been turned into a movie. 2. Its Similar to Tolstoy Kings novella shares several plot points with a nine-page short story by Russian writer Leo Tolstoy called God Sees the Truth But Waits. Both are about men sent to prison for murders they didnt commit. 3. Director Frank Darabont Got a Good Deal on the Rights to Kings Story He bought the rights from King for $1. 4. It Almost Had a Much Different Cast Castle Rock Entertainment the studio that made Shawshank was co-founded by Rob ReinerŠ—”director of another King adaptation Stand By MeŠ—”and is named after the mythical Maine town that provides the setting for many of Kings books. After director Frank Darabont pitched Shawshank to the studio Reiner originally offered $2.5 million for the script to star Tom Cruise as Andy Dufresne and Harrison Ford as Red. 5. The Original Title Was Changed to Avoid Confusion Darabont wrote the script in eight weeks before pitching it to Castle Rock Entertainment. He decided to drop the Rita Hayworth part of the novella because actresses sent their resumes in for consideration thinking it was a Rita Hayworth biopic. During the casting process Darabont even received a call from an agent who represented a supermodelpositive,This is the best batman movie out there. Heath Ledger as the joker was the perfect choice as he made Joker almost real. He became the Joker and I was so fascinated about his acting skills. Such a shame he has past away R.I.P Heath Ledger. I love Christian Bale as Batman he was a really great choice and I dont really care about how the voice is overrated as people say its really good anyway. The only thing I would have loved was more Scarecrow in the movie. Even in the dark knight rises and in batman begins I wanted more scarecrow because Cillian Murphy is such a brilliant actor as Scarecrow. This is my favorite movie. Everyone should have seen it once at least. In my case Ive seen it over 30 times.positive,This is the Batman movie I waited my entire life to see Adam West the Animated Series and maybe Michael Keatons Batman were decent but this film is on another level of awesome - and I mean it when I ask why it took so long for someone to do the Batman franchise a solid favor. The characters portrayed by Christian Bale Michael Caine Heath Ledger Gary Oldman Aaron Eckhart Maggie Gyllenhaal Morgan Freeman and the music of Hans Zimmer really come together for swell time for a Batman fan. Another aspect I enjoy is the city-scape of Chicago throughout the film. As a person from the Midwest that kind of sweetens the deal.positive,This is Tarantinos best film And I think that Bruce Willis is excellent  John Travolta and Bruce Willis are doing all the work And the result is superb  This film is brilliant positive,This is such a good movie that even to this day many years after it came out I still cannot find a single person who does not like Shawshank redemption. Everything in this film is timed well. The story is excellent and flows with perfect timing and the editing between the sequences are great. The acting is great and it keeps you interested from the first to the last frame. It also has a very clever plot. You are not 100% sure what Tim Robbins is up to and how he has escaped until much later. Great job by everyone from director actors to script. Just the best in movie making.positive,This is really a great movie I loved this movie and it doesnt get all It is a classic and and from my point of view the the best Tarantino movie This was made for all movie lovers An extraordinary visual adventure for the spectator The acting is really good and the casting is amazing There you have the two mob killers Vincent Vega and Jules Winnfield The duo John Travolta and Samuel L Jackson was the best ive ever seen Then you have the boxer: Buuuutsch Bruce Willis There is also the Wolf not the one from Wall Street played by the wonderful Hrvey Keitel There is also the the extraordinary Wife Uma Thruman brings it to another one as Mia Wallace The screenplay is really interesting because it involves three parallel stories told to the spectator through different chapters Sometimes you have movies known for the ONE big scene but in this case it is impossible to only take one two or three scenes The whole movie is a CLASSIC and a must-see before dyingpositive,this is one of those movies where after the it ends you will say that was 2 hours well spent action begins from the go and it is very realistic or at least they have made it look realistic on the screen unlike some other similar movies there is no flying or gravity defying moves here its more of a close combat and that really intrigued me precision perfect stunts and amazing cinematography with a touch of humor will definitely make you come alive the characters in the movie are really appealing a notable candidate would be the super villain calmhumorous and villainous all at the same time loved his character even though the movie is action packed it comes with a good story a very good one in fact so the bottom line is this is a great movie and worth your time positive,This is one of those movies that you will end up watching again after a while and forget just how good it is I think they should start playing more reruns on the TV As far as the plot Its a Batman movie. If youve seen one you know what is going on. I think the main reason I enjoy this trilogy more than the others is because it seems to be darker grittier than the others if that makes sense.. The movie keeps you on the edge of your seat right from the beginning. I like all of the movies from this trilogy if I had to choose I would pick this one as the best although ... I will change my mind on occasion they are all really good. If you are looking for must watch movies I dont think you could go wrong with this. If you like it I suggest the rest I include this movie when suggesting movies to my friends all the time. Enjoy P.S. - Dont forget the popcornpositive,This is one of those movies that you just have to see to believe. The only flaw is that the plot is a bit confusing at first to some viewers but will soon be figured out. Some parts are almost like a mystery movie. First I have to explain the Joker in The Dark Knight but Im not sure which words to use. Ledger played the part like hed been the character all his life and there wasnt a single part that I doubted he was the Joker. Seriously his words came so easily and everything about the character was done brilliantly. As for Batman/Bruce Wayne the dark voice Bale voiced the character with suited him perfectly and once again we see yet another perfect example of flawless acting. The karate the strength the intelligence even... It was ALL there He also looked just like Bruce Wayne should have. Everyone did an amazing job and the make-up for Two-Face was stunning. Like seriously it was so freaky and cool. This is a good movie. If you like lots of violence and comic book characters. Believe me. It was SPECTACULAR.  about continuity in a lifetime based on friendship and hope. positive,This is one of those films that come once in a blue moon. The ones that leave you sitting on your seat staring at the screen when the film is ended and trying to think of a word to describe the excellence of the film Although Shawshank does take a while to get started but you understand why later on the film. The characters need to be explained for you to understand later points in the film. What really makes this film great is the use of no special effects no stunts just plain simple amazingly originalwitty story writing and outstanding acting by every character in the film including the minor ones. Just based in a prison men talking to each other. This film does make you feel involved in the film. You feel every characters emotions and pain and share their joy and happiness. When the film ends it takes you 10 seconds to get back to reality again - its just that compelling Best personal Film of all time and best film on IMDb and rightly so Spectacular Film   however it is a requirement that the dialogues are made to be easier to understand rather than being kept in the original Tolkien style since you cannot re-see a scene like when you can re-read a part of the book if you did not understand. The choice of actors are undoubtedly most suitable while the costume and prosthetics are as realistic as it gets. Howard Shore was great and words could not describe the sensations that flow out of each of his pieces. I do not understand why some people actually accuse the film of being terrible in any aspect. The length of the film is a necessity in order to be able to portray the depth of the story and do justice to Tolkiens masterpiece. If it was to be any shorter then the film would be missing essential elements required to bring out the majesty of Middle-Earth. It is simply unfair to say that and this is missing therefore it is not worth watching because if Jackson was to include everything EACH of the trilogy would be over 10 hours long assuming it took everyone that long to read. I for one will not be sitting in a chair for 10 hours and I believe it will also be unpractical to produce a movie that is 10 hours long. It follows that there will be minor discrepancies in the plot but it did not deter the storyline keeping in mind that this is an adaptation. Despite some criticism of this film being overrated I believe that it deserves to be ranked as one of the best films ever produced and its grandeur unmatched. Overall this is a very enchanting film that is worth watching especially for fans of the Lord of the Rings. The Extended Edition is also a personal recommendation as it includes some missing elements that were not necessary for the progression of the plot but adds nicely to the storyline. positive,This is one of the movies of all time. Theres action beyond belief and humor that breaks down the tension that really works. There also enough emotion to round out the experience. The joker is one of the best characters of all time. Hes truly amazing. R.I.P Mr. Heath ledger. Christian bale is of course one of the best actors ever. Its truly a gift to watch them on screen. See this movie it will make you a better person. The ending is perfect and amazing. Every time I watch it pick up something new. There was a lot of effort put into this. Better than batman begins but not as good as inception. Its actually surprisingly under rated.positive,This is one of the most amazing movies Ive ever watched. It is based on a Steven King book which makes the plot not predictable. The story twists and turns while during the movie it seems that it is heading on a straight path forward. It tells the story of a banker which is accused of murdering his wife and her lover. He is sentenced to life in prison and placed in the Shawshank prison where he meets a group of inmates which become his close friends during the decades he spends in prison. The movie tells the story of his life and struggles in the prison environment. Any addition to the abstract will spoil the experience and perhaps be a spoiler. The amazing casting of both Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins is amazing and couldnt be more accurate. I remember the first time I saw this movie many more viewing after that the movie just dont get old I was engulfed in it for the whole duration. A must-see movie for anyone and everyone.positive,This is one of the greatest films I have ever seen. It has everything The battle scenes are wonderful especially and since the first hour is drama the action really gets to you and you feel like youre really there that is terrified. You care about the characters more than anything in this film so its scary watching a battle scene for the first time because its extremely unpredictable and you dont want your characters to die a few of them do. However the battle scenes are also very well done with a great mix of live-action and cgi. Although this is a PG-13 film Jackson really went over the limit with his battles  he totally rocked in the previous films. Telling us to wait for the extended version isnt right. Maybe Jackson should have foregone one of the too many endings in ROTK to give Lee some film time. That said all the elements that worked in the previous movies were absolutely glorious in this film. The one new thing that I would add to so much that has already been written is that big kudos must go to the great Tolkien artists Alan Lee and John Howe whose artistry shaped so much of the imagery from the first moments of FOTR to the final scenes of ROTK. This historic trilogy would not have been the same without them. The LOTR enterprise has clearly been a great labor of love from all who worked on it over the years and this final installment was a crowning achievement. positive,This is one of the best movies about friendship Ive ever seen also one of the best prison movies. I found it better than Robert Redfords CASTLE. Morgan Freeman was perfect as usual and I can say that Tim Robbins reached the top of his performance and also his career. I wish this couple come together for another movie the kind of it is not important Im sure the spectators will have the same taste as before. I watched most of the films of Morgan Freeman and I can say this was the best of his normally he prefers to play in films like SevenKiss the girlsAlong came a spider... but I think he should think again that which kind of his films stay at the top of the charts...  all the other glitches are just that. If only you had given us Tolkiens rendition here. positive,This is one of the best Ive watched the movie trilogy. I dont see TDK just as a superhero comic book movie because screenplay was written in a perfect way. Created by Nolan Batsuit-mobile perfect design. The most beautiful thing in the film to return to The Jokers and Ledger as the Joker was created to be such an amazing acting. When good and evil sits down to have a talk like an interrogation scene everyone in the audience shuts up and listens to what they have to say. Thats I think this movie is great. I just did not like the actor who portray the character of Rachel Dawes. Other than that Nolan and his team did a great job. They can make 100 movies but we will feel its something missing perfect acting one of the best actors of all time nobody can be better than Ledger as the Joker.positive,This is one of the best Batman movies that I have ever seen. I believe that they did a great job. I love DC and this movie was able to remind me why that was. Because there are all kind of superheroes. There is only one Batman. When you are able to that this role on to the fullest and truly be come the Bat.That is when you can make some thing good in to something great. There are a many other good twist and turns. They will live you in shock.The Bat will face challenges. Some will make him strong and other will leave him almost broken. In these without the Joker it would be so lame. He bring the hummer. Why so serious Batman has all that anyone needs. He with be the catalyst for the whole movie. I have never seen someone out side of the Batman cartoon be this go as a Joker. When you watch this movie it fell like the Joker is real. When you bring to people together that can become The Bat and Joker that is when you have made as a batman movie this was a once in a life time movie I dont know if anyone could ever be a better Joker. If you dont believe what im saying then you need to watch it for your self. The you will understand why I think Batman is so great for your self. To me The Dark Knight should prove one thing to all people. Six words only There must always be a Batmon.positive,This is one of or maybe the best movie of the century It is so unique when it comes to jumping from different places to different times No other director than Quentin Tarantino could have made this movie so special Just take a look at lets say Reservoir Dogs Here he use the same teqnique but in a totally different way He is very aware of his one directing Tarantino and he seems like a very intelligent person Therefore I say that Pulp Fiction is a movie that indeed deserves 10 starspositive,This is one of my favorite movies.I love the acting and characters.I think it is intense and suspenseful.I think it has one of the best versions of the Joker.I like how it deals with the corruption of the police force.My favorite part is when Batman interrogated Joker.I think it was unique that Batman could not save Rachelsince usually the hero saves someone that has been kidnapped.I liked Harvey going bad because it shows that even really good people can turn.I dont blame it on the Joker though because Harvey was a little bad when he interrogated the guy in the chair.People in Internal Affairs also called him Harvey two-face implying he had a darker side. I would recommend this movie to any Batman or drama fan.positive,This is one of my favorite movies of all time. My favorite parts are the characters of Sam Jackson and John Travolta Jules Winfield and Vincent Vega. Quentin Tarantino did a fantastic job. Other movies have tried to compare but none will. My good friend out in Los Angeles is an actor and he and his scene partner acted out the scene of Jules and Vincent driving around town and having a discussion about Vincents recent travels abroad. And the writing was just amazing how the writer tied everything together so perfectly. And I think that its the dialogue that drives the movie and makes it such high quality. Everything from the gold watch speech to Harvey Keitels dialogue. Quentin always seems to find a way to make the something horrific quite humorous without ever seeming to ask for a laugh. He combines utilitarian prose with flights of rough poetry and a wicked fancy.positive,This is one of my all-time favorite movies The subtle details of this move amaze me every time I watch it My only problem is getting friends to watch the movie that havent seen it During the whole movie I sit there watch this part as they are talking amongst themselves Then at the end of the movie it doesnt make sense to them This is a great movie and I thank Quentin Tarantino for making it the way he did There is nothing about this movie that I would change I just wish I could make everyone sit down and pay close attention so they also could appreciate this movie the way I and all the other voters do Thankspositive,This is on of my favorite movies of all times Not to mention that Quentin Tarantino is probable one of my favorite directors on top of it but this movie is just one more prime example of why that is The performances of John Travolta and Samuel L Jackson are riveting to watch and leave the viewer wanting more Let us not forget the cameo performance either Wonderful job to Quentin for pulling of yet another stunning performance on the big screen The screen write is unprecedented to anything that has been released until now and has set the bar for future films to come If you are looking for a film of the decade you have found it This is definitely a film to last through the timespositive,This is not only a great comic book movie not only a great crime thriller movie but one of the best movies of all time. The best villain in all of DC comics The Joker comes to life as he is portrayed by Heath Ledger who literally gave the performance of his life as he tragically passed away before the films release. Bale is fantastic once again as Batman returning with that epic voice and giving the fans once of the best movie quotes ever Im not wearing hockey pads. The tone for this movie is dark and really gritty and takes nearly all the comic book elements and throws them out the window making this an epic movie for anyone to enjoy not just comic book fans. The soundtrack cinematography and direction for this movie is amazing just go an watch it if you havent already. 10/10positive,This is my favorite movie of all time I was 15 when I first saw this At that time I didnt think movies could get any better than True Lies Pulp Fiction changed that for me It set me on my quest to get a better knowledge of film From then on I wanted to see films that had a good plot and that showcased good acting It made me want to see GOOD films Ive said goodbye to those pathetic action and comedy movies I began to see the films of Bergman Scorsese DeNiro Kubrick Altman The list goes on and on 10 out of 10positive,This is my 1st review on IMDb  i dont like writing reviews for a movie after all its just a movie.....you see a movie and you forget... 95% of the movies you see and you forget soon well this movie really moves you and some of it remains with you ....gives you a great deal of idea how the real world is... each time you see it you feel light and get a feeling of satisfaction .... and more over if you like Morgan free-man youll love of him after this one.... GREAT MOVIE... used to wonder why is it so highly rated.... well after seeing it.... i dont want to let the rating fall so i added mine and given it what it deserves...and i hope it remains at the top... i would like to thank the film maker and the production as a fan for a wonderful experience i got after seeing this movie :positive,This is indeed the best movie I have ever seen I dont know how people actually hate it Its a totally original movie its got everything from violence to extreme profanity this in my opinion gets a 10/10 for surepositive,This is hands down the best movie i have ever seen Quentin Tarantino did such a good job I dont see how Sam Jackson didnt win the best supporting actor award The only thing this movie needs is Robert De Niro and they got it all This is such a good moviepositive,This is for sure not the movie you can just leave behind in the theaters it is a must to have this in your movie collection. And like any true trilogy this movie is not the same if you have not seen the previous two installments. If you grew up and always loved Batman and Marvel movies and comics this one will not disappoint you. It is great to see all the characters come back and look and act even that much more fitting then you remembered them. Christian Bale played an extraordinary batman and i might say he could be one of the best actors to play batman. In my eyes this is an exceptional superhero movie it is masterful filmmaking by any standard.positive,This is filmmaking at its apex Though I would hardly argue that this film is the greatest which is what many IMDB users relate after theyve just seen a movie they really like and then forget about once the next Titanic or Matrix hype machine bursts their way I must say that Pulp Fiction added more to the cinematic lexicon more than any other film of the 90s And who can argue with that Indeed it is one of my favorites just for its adamant refusal to do things by-the-book and many previous comments essay this film as a highly moral and spiritual piece--they couldnt be more right When the film came out a lot of the reviewers commented on its cinematic brand of hipnessBeing hip is cool but I wouldnt necessarily equate that with great movies--just look at Men in Black which was sorta fun but hardly the endurable piece of cinema that Pulp Fiction has become So what sets it apart from the rest of the crowd Its exactly this spiritualitywatching the film I remember being shocked and enlightened at the same time being unbearably tensed up and utterly charmed and in agreement with this weird California former video clerks world view The film is a tour-de-force of the cinematic style  one of my favorite shots in the film seems to be a homage to both the fast-paced unbreaking style of Scorseses Goodfellas and Roman Polanskis Rosemarys Baby It is the scene where Travolta crashes his Malibu into Eric Stoltzs front yard and brings the ODed Thurman inside his house As Rosanna Arquette hurls invectives at the two the camera wonderful work by Andrez Sekula moves back and forth between Arquette and Travolta and Stoltz lurching over Thurman thats the Scorsese part Then as Stoltz goes looking for the plunger the camera follows him into a room where it inexplicably stops at the doorway so as to impede a full sight of Stoltz reminders of the scene where Polanski photographed Ruth Gordon in Rosemarys Baby by placing an obstruction between her and the camera so the audience would instinctively lurch their head to the side making a hopeless attempt to see around the obstruction Such a phrase can be used to describe Pulp Fiction: most movies simply unfurl their stories at the audience This movie subliminally makes you a part of the action I recently had a semi-argument with a friend over the worth of this film over Natural Born Killers Now dont get me wrong Oliver Stone is a powerful filmmaker but his film banged you over the head incessantly with points like Im Going to Use my Artistic License to Satirize the Over-the-Top Violence of Popular Culture by Making a Movie Replete WithOver-the-Top Violence In the style of David Spade Its called hypocrisy Oliver--check into it Anyways I digress Anybody who bad-mouths this movie indeed has no appreciation for cinema  sure the film may have a goof or an errant philosophy somewhere  but Tarantino fulfilled any filmmakers dream in revitalizing cinema You can say that the films tone didnt impress you that its style wasnt to your tastebut you cant deny the artistry that went into it Morality For all of those who believe this film is an amoral travesty I suggest you rent the family favorite The Santa Clause and count how many times Disney shamelessly milks its own products or if God is mentioned even once in what is supposed to be a Christmas film Or in ANY family film What impressed me the most when I first saw Pulp Fiction was its inclusion of God at all many Generation-X filmmakers paging Kevin Smith are so agnostic in their beliefs that it was so refreshing to see one that painted divinity in such a positive light You can have those other indie favorites Chasing Amy and Good Will Huntingboth starring those irritating crybabies Matt Damon and Ben Affleck and if you like those cynical films which are basically reworkings of oh-feel-sorry-for-me melodramas of the late-40s reworked with equally irritating alternative rock best summed up by the Smashing Pumpkins in a Simpsons episode: Alls we got is our millions of dollars our legions of fans and our youth then you can have them Compare that to Jules awakening I was just sitting here eating my muffin and drinking my coffee when I had what alcoholics refer to as a moment of clarity and youll see how Tarantino turned the mythic Gen-X stereotype on its head as well Pulp Fiction is in my opinion the king of the indies and one of the best examples of cinematic craftsmanship everpositive,This is definitely the best film of the 90s closely followed by Seven and Fight Club Tarantino breaks the molds of the gangster film and gives a great and at many time comedic look into the lives of two hit men Bruce Willis also gives his best performance ever mostly because he doesnt say much in the film The music is just perfect as with almost all of Tarantinos films If you havent watch this film Watch it right now I think for me at least the most drawn out part of the film is Vinces interactions with Mia mostly because I find myself partial to Sam Jackson Anyways this film is a great Go watch it then watch it again Then ask yourself What does Marsellus Wallace look likepositive,This is definitely one of my favorite movies -- it makes me cry and laugh and ache inside all at once. Tim Robbins you make my days a little brighter -- thank youpositive,This is by far the greatest movie I have ever seen. Christopher Nolan reached new heights and created a masterpiece. Let me start with the acting. Heath Ledger is one of the most underrated actors ever. He fit the role of the Joker much better than his previous actor Jack Nicholson. Every word he said was more insane than the word before it. His list of famous quotes stretches more than 100 yards long. He is scary mischievous and downright psychotic. His crazy schemes almost always come together and they they push their victims to the limits. Christian Bale also performed extremely well but not as well as Ledger. He was a great Bruce Wayne and his part was terrifically written. Aaron Eckhart and Gary Oldman also performed extremely well and their characters helped make the movie what it is: amazing. The suspense in this movie pushes you to the edge of your patience and when it finally pays off oh boy is it good I can barely find anything wrong with this movie. It is nearly flawless.positive,This is by far the best of the 3 sequels. I personally feel this has got to be the best movie of 2003. It is a must see. The fight scenes and the acting have truly culminated into one of the best cinema experiences I have ever experienced.positive,This is beyond doubt my favourite movie of all-time. I am a Morgan Freeman fan and apart from Driving Miss Daisy i have loved all his movies that i have seen. The Shawshank Redemption stands above all. I think it is a great movie with a sad overall story but a happy and just ending. The only other prison movie i like as much is the classic Clint Eastwood movie Escape from Alcatraz. The Shawshank Redemption has long been my favourite movie and even though i have the DVD i still watch when it is on TV. 15 years since its release and i still havent seen anything i like more. I would recommend this movie to everyone and if you havent seen it yet you must be living in a cave or something. If you are in a cave get out and go see this fantastic movie. 10/10positive,This is an awesome movie that has crime thrill and comedy You wont be bored even for a single minute in this 154 minute movie as the story is very interesting and entertaining The story line is written in such a way that it prevents you to get out of your seat at any point of time The four stories blend themselves in a very beautiful way that you have might have never seen before Everyone did superb acting in the movie especially John Travolta and Bruce Willis Quentin Tarantino has put in some ultimate dialogues in this movie that make the movie special 10 on 10 for this superb movie Must watch for allpositive,This is an amazing film let me get that out of the way first there is no doubt about it The cast list alone is impressive Samuel L Jackson John Travolta Bruce Willis and many other top celebrities along with walk on parts for Steve Buscimi and even Quentin Tarantino himself The Overall plot of Pulp Fiction could be quite hard to follow as it isnt set out chronologically but you will figure out whats happening when eventually Ive watched this film around 5 or 6 times and every time I watch it I notice something new The first time I watched it I thought it was more of a crime action/thriller but you will soon realise that it can be classed quite easily as a comedy Alot of the jokes are well hidden and there are a few in-jokes but anyone on this website will probably get them One point though this film is not for the faint hearted there are some scenes of violence and general not being nice one scene in particular which I seriously hope you wouldnt want to see I wont say any more but yuckpositive,this is an amazing film it keeps you on your toes from the start all the way until the end i would suggest it for anyone to watch although its 2 and a half hours long not once was i bored i would suggest this film to anyone it really is amazing its amazing gripping thrilling and highly intelligent it has a superb twist and you never expect what happens this film is exciting and im so glad i got to see it for once id also suggest watching the trailer as it doesnt ruin the film although most of them do i would happily watch this film over and over as its surprising but yet it is still interestingpositive,This is a very very very great film. Its my all time favorite. First of all the acting is f**king great. My favorite actor in the entire film is easily Morgan Freeman. He should have won that Oscar The fact that he didnt is a f**king disgrace. Now the music to this movie is not to memorable but is still great and sets the mood for the film. Now the story line is brilliant. Andy Dufresne is accused of the murder of the wife and her secret lover so he is sentenced to Shawshank State Prison. There he develops a friendship with a prisoner named Red. The sets in this movie are great. As expected. So in the end this is a great movie and you should really check it out.positive,This is a very dark movie and Heath Ledgers Joker is the darkest it gets. The entire movie is like an eerie roller coaster ride. Theres not much CGI here only a truly haunting  and dashes of the Jokers mesmerizing lines. The action is kept from being overblown and thats really encouraging in this era of mindless CGI-driven summer blockbusters. More importantly the story of Bruce Wayne is taken to new high or low. This is unlike any comic book movie you have ever seen one that youll keep coming back to. All of the actors deserve their kudos but Ledger overshadows them all.positive,This is a superb film in all possible ways The acting is astonishing the camera work sublime and the  is fantastic This is the best work Travolta has ever done and even Bruce Willis gives a great performance A stellar supporting cast includes Tim Roth Amanda Plummer and Eric Stoltz in the famous needle scene Rent this I guarantee you will not be disappointedpositive,This is a must watch movie in every once lifelove it.. the reviews which are ahead are as good as the movie... every frame in the movie has its meaning. one can think easily that even though movie came on to the screen two decades earlier it is still no:1 in its position i personally created this account to give my rating and write a review on such a wonderful film. i felt very happy after watching this film and i thought of sharing with you. finally i want to say that entertainment is there ever corner of our life. but meaning of the true life lies with in this movie. this movie give a valuable message if we want a thing really & actually from the heart then every force on this earth will try to help us..but the only thing we have to do is never loose HOPEpositive,this is a movie for anyone who loves science fiction the film had a long playtime but after ive seen the movie i understood why its a galactic experience with such detail and sense of a space simulator did you find movie gravity was cool so is this movie light years better it has a style similar to 2001 a space odyssey but everything in this movie has so much more to effort this isnt an adventure its more like an explosion of details and experiences through a drama perspective it has it all for the fanatical science fiction nerd to thrive and the movie does that to the maximum an excellent moviepositive,This is a masterpiece that words cant describe.In my opinion and many others this is the Best Movie if not Ever at least of the 21st century no doubt. Heath Ledger was so so so awesomewho could ever thought that he could be the Joker and not only be but playing it in the best way possible.C.Bale is my favorite Batman of all time and Aaron Eckhart was pretty good too. Here has a 9.0 rating which in my opinion is not enough it should have had at least 9.5 but hey after all it has 1.2 million voters and 47.5% gave it a 10. This movie is epic is just so good I will never understand those who hate on this movie but this movie is so good and the best one out there.If you havent seen the movie go see it now you have no idea what youre missing even though I dont think there are many humans that havent watch this movie. I would say I give it a 10 but it seems so little for this movie so I give it 11/10.positive,This is a Masterpiece Tarantino changed cinema forever when he created these characters it is not one individual effort that makes this film what it is however from the sublime direction to the quick witted script that keeps you on your toes throughout to the phenomenal and underrated performances by John Travolta and Uma Thurman Pulp Fiction is perfection I went into this film with high expectations I had recently been introuduced to Tarantino through his previous feature Reservoir Dogs which was also very good and so was anxious to see how he would handle a bigger production with a bigger budget and some of Hollywoods best Willis Jackson Travolta but there was no need to be as I was delivered a masterclass in film A very simple premise of two mob men dispatched on a daily round evolves into something much more and the with regards to the mystery of the contents of the briefcase a risky move by Tarantino but it ultimately paid off as people still speculate to this day about it My belief is it contained his soul The way in which Tarantino takes these apparently different stories and mixes them together to create some truly spectacular scenes is applaudable to say the leastpositive,This is a great movie. Being the second movie in the Dark Knight trilogy this is definitely the best. Yes it can be disturbing at certain times but once you get past the violence and the dark undertone its a great movie that anyone above the age of 11 can enjoy. Also the actors in this movie are AMAZING Heath Ledger plays a great Joker and even has the laugh down. He is by far the best portrayal of the Joker. Also Christian Bale is the best portrayal of Batman that I have seen and Im sure that many fans would agree. He has the voice the looks and the acting skills to pull off the most bad ass superhero of all time.positive,this is a film that demands your viewing visually emotionally and mentally do not let that scare you let it entice you and draw upon your wonder of the unknown and the curiosity of discovery i suggest you see this film with someone whether that be a friend family or significant other prepare for a few tears a few laughs and prepare to be baffled and mesmerized this is a film that pushes many limits and some might say the limits of its audience but i see that as a positive this film will remind you of 2001 the tree of life apollo 13 and insomnia for those looking for the link to christopher nolans other work insomnia is your best bet this carries all of the same acting writing and directing marvels of that film dark knight fans may be shied away and fans looking for the action of inception may leave feeling cheated but ignore them this is a film for people it is a personal and human film its most tender moments will cause views to draw on emotions and relationships in their own life it reaches beyond the screen asking some very personal as well as philosophical questions the film in the end may not have all the answers or even explain itself completely but is does not suffer from these aspects but rises higher because of them the movie is not perfect but it is not supposed to be perfect just like the first maps drawn or the first exploration into unknown waters there will be missteps and wrong turns i am keeping this short to avoid giving anything away go see this film with an open mind and it will reward you in every way it is a giant step forward in modern cinema it is a film that will be discussed for years to come and it is a film that has the power to affect the viewer something not many films in todays market can boast i cannot remember the last time a movie truly left me speechless there have been films i have wanted to watch again right away films i needed to process or films that had me deep in thought this film not only achieved all of the above but truly and honestly left me speechless the film will demand a great deal of the viewer including the three hour runtime but like any great adventure the reward at the end is greater than the sum of its partspositive,This is a cinematic masterpiece It is nothing short of brilliant and an incredible contribution to international cinema It contains arguably the funniest and wittiest dialogue ever in a film Everybody in the world should see this movie No matter what age 5 starspositive,This has got to be one of my favourite films of all time. I first saw it when it made it to British TV and have only just got round to buying it and ive watched it a few times since then. The characters have so much depth you end up loving them the more you watch this film. The acting is first class. The cinematography is first class. The sound is first class. The casting is first class. The dialogue is fantastic. All these elements and more make this a riveting watch and you end up wishing the film could be longer. This is one of the few times ive seen a film after reading the book thinking the film is an improvement. It seems to me it expands a little on Stephen Kings novella. This film deserves the rating it has here on IMDbpositive,This film was absolutely amazing. I have spent hours re-watching various scenes and noticing all the perfection with which they are acted and directed.I like it.I watched this film since 2009.But it is in the my mind still.The acted and special effects are very good. I think Orlando Bloom is the best actor in the film.Because I love archery. I like Legolas.He killed two elephants with one arrow.He is very good archer. Sarumans army are very strong.The goods is weaker than Sarumans army.But goods are win every time.So the goods win the war with Aragorns strong. This film very good.Really I recommend watch this film to you. This film to do who thanks.positive,This film ranks second among my all time favourites. The only reason it does not hold that coveted first place spot is that I am obsessed with Monty Pythons The Holy Grail. Shawshank is a beautifully crafted film with one of the best endings I have ever seenpositive,This film or may be masterpiece changed the whole outlook of mine towards life. The characters played by Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins were so real and so closed to my heart that I cried and I laughed with them while watching it for the first time. We learn from books we learn from our parents we learn from our friends and we learn from movie like The Shawshank Redemption.Once upon a time I was going through a bad phase of my life and bit depressed also. Then some suggested me to watch this. What happened next was simply miracle. The pain endured by Tim Robbins was no less than mine. But it was hope that kept him alive. That infused a new joy in my life and I achieved success in very little amount of time. The dialogues are simply straight yet touching. The movie has universal appeal - It can move anyone because characters played by Freeman and Robbins are so close to heart. Double thumbs up to Stephen King and Frank Darabont for teaming up and offering this life changing piece of cinema. This movie was not made for Oscars although it grabbed multiple nominations and not for critics some critics ridicule about its number position in IMDb 250. It was made for common people like us. Humble salute to all who were directly or indirectly associated with this all time classic.positive,This film manages to redeem Hollywood in the eyes of people who feared it long lost in a dark sea of clich’©s and predictability. Darabont shows us that artists still work in the Hollywood studios and production facilities. These artists show their capability to produce artpositive,This film is the best film ever made. This is because it concludes an epic story which is full of complex characters and amazing scenes.each has a different quest and most get tied up at the end of the film. In addition this film have various epic moments which hold the pure essence of film making and great story telling and this film is full of emotion which will attach to the viewer while they watch it. lastly this film has no points which get boring or uninteresting. Therefore every second of this film is epic due to its detailed battle scenes and complex character relations like Frodo and Sam which give warm emotion and courage to the film.positive,This film is sweeping and epic yet never manages to lose its human touch. It has a message for each and every one of us and is as varied and personal as the many faces of Middle Earth. If you take nothing from this film other than this you will be the richer: this is an important a VITAL film because it has something to teach everyone and we are all the better for it.positive,This film is really an amazing movie timeless. One of my all time favorites. About the long-can write something in a movie. Masters said everything I needed There is not yet aware of the movie and I watched it for people to watch I would like to invite. Than You. Shawshank Redemption is a very moving story about hope and the power of friendship. The cast is first rate with everyone giving a great performance. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman carry the movie but Bob Gunton and Clancy Brown are perfect as the Warden Norton and prison guard captain Hadley respectively. And James Whitmores portrayal of an elderly inmate Brooks is moving. The screenplay gives almost every actor at least one or more memorable lines through out the film. As well as a very surprising twist near the end that almost knocked me out of my chair. If you have not seen this movie rent it or better yet buy it. As I bet youll want to see this one more than once.positive,This film is pure class. I do not want to give anything away but heath ledgers performance in this is the best performance i have ever seen in my lifetime. Shame it overshadows Gary Oldmans amazing performance as well. Every aspect of this film is amazing the ideas the performances and the screenplay i remember coming out of the cinema in pure shock of how good this movie is. NEED to watch. incredible. Christopher Nolan is a geniuspositive,This film is phenomenal easily top 5 or even the best film of all time It is rare for me to feel happy while watching a film but when I watch this movie I feel happy I listen to every word and feel completely immersed in every thing that is happening It is shocking that this film only won one Oscar very frustrating to even think about it but most people seem to agree this is much better than Forrest Gump I feel myself hating that movie for these reasons Samuel l Jackson should have won an Oscar his performance is incredible I hang on every word he says he also has a lot of memorable lines The characters in this film act so well together that it doesnt even seem like their acting but are instead meaning it The soundtrack couldnt have been any better it is perfect Tarantinos talent is displayed in full view here at the top of his abilities This film is not serious it is more relaxed and entertaining but done so well you take it seriously if that makes sense I rarely have strong feelings for most films but this film is different than most films different in way that is more well done than most films that go by the rules/guidelines This film is tied with The Good The Bad and The Ugly for the best film of all time No film will ever be like Pulp Fiction ever again unless they copy it that says a lot Id recommend this film to anyone everybody needs to see this film it is the best of Tarantinos masterpieces I cant believe people cry about this films success 1 star ratings by people that cant handle this filmpositive,This film is perfect from the begining to the end in my humble opioion this is one of thoes films which only come along every so often and totally amaze peopleothers being Usual suspectsShawshank and The Godfather. I think the greatness of this film lies in the way it makes you think the way it intertwines a few stories into one and also by the amazing cast I dont want to bore you by going on for too long about this filmeven though I could go on for some time ill simply advise you to watch this film because once you have youll never look back 10/10positive,This film is just too good for words to describe go and see this spectacle it will blow anyone away Im not the biggest fan of fantasy adventures but this has blown me away and what an ending for the the brilliant trilogy. Return of the king is better than the other two LOTR films in my opinion but all three films are a joy to watch over and over again Cant praise Peter Jackson enough as i said earlier on he created a peace of film making which is too good for words to describe and everyone should go witness this spectaclepositive,This film is brilliant just brilliant. I watched this film expecting just a normal movie but when it ended I knew it would stay with me forever. Every decade has one or two groundbreaking movies the 70s had The Godfather and Apocalypse Now the 80s had Platoon and Raging Bull the 90s had The Shawshank Redemption and Pulp Fiction and the 2000s had Gladiator and The Lord Of The Rings. There were a lot of good films in the 90s and this is up there with the best . The story is about a man called Andy Dufresne Tim Robbins who is wrongly convicted and sent to the Shawshank Prison. When there he meets Red Morgan Freeman and then the story takes off. The acting is incredible and Freeman and Robbins deliver the performances of their career the script is incredible another great collaboration between Steven King and Frank Darabont and it didnt win one single Oscar This could have been good enough for three Oscars at the least true the competition Forrest Gump and Pulp Fiction were good films but The Shawshank was certainly good enough to win a couple. So if you havent seen The Shawshank Redemption buy it rent it and watch one of the most powerful and moving films ever be prepared to be blown away.positive,This film is Amazingand Coolthis is the best than the orderThis is a very nice film over the other this movie it was great it was very fantastic movie  I love this movie and this movie it was great This is a very nice film over the other this movie it was great it was very fantastic movie  I love this movie and this movie it was great This is a very nice film over the other this movie it was great it was very fantastic movie  I love this movie and this movie it was great This is a very nice film over the other this movie it was great it was very fantastic movie This is a very nice film over the other this movie it was great it was very fantastic movie  I love this movie and this movie it was great  I love this movie and this movie it was greatpositive,This film is amazing because it has a great screen-play it is at the same time an excellent thriller and an intelligent comedy and we only can see it in a few brilliant movies a fabulous director Quentin Tarantino that had done other great movies like Jackie Brown or Reservoir dogs and well actors and actresses mainly John Travolta with the best movie of his career the incredible Samuel L Jackson and Uma Thurman I think the first and the last moments of the movie are only some of the best moments of Cinema that I saw in my life I think its incredible how a great movie like Pulp Fiction didnt won the Oscar of best movie of the year losing to the good but not excellent Forrest Gump Pulp Fiction isnt only one of the best movies of the 90s it is for me one of the best movies of everpositive,This film is about hope friendship and redemption. It has solid performances from Morgan Freeman Tim Robbins and Bob Gunton the warden. Freeman masterfully narrates and he is the life blood of this film. You experience everything through himpositive,this film is a true fairy tale its dark its raw and its written from the dark raw experience of women maleficent is about what happens when your prince turns into a frog its the personal inner journey to recover from a physical trauma and emotional betrayal by those who are closest to us and who we trust the most its about how to survive that type of horrific evil without becoming evil yourself its message is that profound the critics complaining about this film want fairy tales to stay in the same onelovefitsall mode where people are either good or evil and that all one needs is to find romantic love and marry a good prince or princess and you will live happily ever after safe from any pain or sorrow but real life is a lot messier than that its actually evidence of how rare it is to see womens unfiltered subjective emotional landscape portrayed on film that it seems many of the critics cannot even wrap their brains around it no matter this film is so sensually visually stunning and viscerally emotionally cathartic that sheer word of mouth enthusiasm is going to make this a blockbuster no matter what the critics say and its equally rare to see a protagonist whose inner landscape is more complex than simply extracting revenge destroying their enemies androll credits people are more complicated than that fairy tale we are sold in every other action and adventure film that only serves to reinforce the psychopathic values of revenge and bravado sometimes a film is so ahead of its time that the critics are behind and so philosophically deep that its message is incomprehensible to the more superficial among us this is one such film woolverton and jolie have crafted a masterpiece dont miss itpositive,This film is a classic And its the dialogue that really clinches it for me - sharp snappy humorous and delivered at a break neck speed - so much so that the subtleness of it requires you to re-watch the film time and again By now ive seen this film 15 or so times and new things still pop up I wont go over the context or the plot of the film as this is well covered by previous comments - needless to say you can download the script from the Net and it literally jumps out at you Its an incredible read Now if the script is THAT good no wonder Travolta and Keitel wanted to do it An awesome film - the No1 film ever made in my estimationpositive,this film had so much energy the way angelina aced her strong amazing performance did this films justice she pushed herself to build a relationship with maleficent although critics were skeptical  the film itself has made $745 million most likely for jolies performance i loved her in this film she is the only reason i choose to see this film again and again oscar nomiantion is for sure worthy for her role elle fanning gave a sweet yet stunning performance also she gave aurora what she needed for fans who have not yet seen this film if you are expecting the orinal  you will be let down this is showing the film from a new point of viewpositive,this film blew me away and it is hard to describe why seeing it together with 1500+ captivated and enthusiastic people at one of the berlinale friedrichstadtpalast screenings surly helped yet what makes this film so unique and touching is its deep humanity although it is a fictional piece you cant help not to relate to the actors as if it would be a documentary every scene feels like real life i know that this is not necessarily a good thing to say about a movie but it is meant as a compliment the actors deliver an outstanding performance while much has already been said about the main characters i was also deeply impressed by the performance of the side characters as well as an example the actor of the second husband of olivia excels in one of the most emotionally straining scenes of the movie the dialogs are touching and feel just natural there are so many scenes and details in the movie where you feel unbelievable close to the actors when patricia arquette says as mother olivia i thought there would be more you instantly think about your own family life and its constant flux i surely hope that this movie will make it to as many screens as possible also i hope that no distributor will force additional editing on it it is perfect as it is and worth any minute if you like people in general and families in particular you will love this moviepositive,This film along with all of the The Lord of the Rings Trilogy are the most amazing films I have ever seen I have also read the book and the ending could have stuck to it more Spoiler: Saruman dies at Bag End in the hands of Grima WormtongueThe Shire is burnt and turned bad because of them- a great scene But still entirely excellent. I especially love the fact that Viggo Mortensen Aragorn sings and Billy Boyd Peregrin/ Pippin Took... All the actors and actresses are terrific the film deserves the 11 Oscars that it received. I am a Peter Jackson fan and Tolkienite all the books are brilliant and the films match them... Such a fan that I have the soundtracks I want to thank also Howard Shore The London Philharmonic Orchestra Ben del Maestro Renee Fleming Sir James Galaway and Annie Lennox for the soundtrack... And to Enya Sheila Chandra Elizabeth Fraser and Emiliana Torrini for The Fellowship of the Ring and The Two Towers soundtrack. I cried....many a time... All I can say is watch it... see for yourself :positive,this doesnt bode well for my reading career gone girl is spectacular a strong contender for this years best picture i couldnt recommend it more highly reading the book isnt necessary the differences between the textual and visual are minimal reconsider the commitment lingering on your bookshelf this is one flick you wont want to miss if youve got a better half bring him or her along both men and women will thoroughly enjoy its long 145 minutes total but should hold your interest throughout the screenplay for gg is by gillian flynn the same woman who penned the novel if gone girl offers any inclination toward the quality of gfs alternative texts lets hope sharp objects and dark places are greenlit director david fincher doesnt have a distinct public persona like tarantino or an iconic physical appearance like scorceses that doesnt detract from his mastery of feature film direction iconic motion pictures like fight club se7en the social network and the girl with the dragon tattoo highlight his filmography if a storys a stairway gone girl is a multitiered double escalator its extremely well written and the tension is like radio static vibrating angrily amidst the coiling  the pacing is kinetic the story constantly switching gears the humor is occasional in a realistic fashion the selfawareness is pointedly subtle the characters are sympathetic and well rounded is it even necessary to mention neil patrick harriss performance? cant we just assume he was fantastic from now on? how about ben affleck everyones favorite punching bag? folks who doubted him should be flogged with a sofa cushion upon recommending gone girl a friends initial hesitation hinges on afflecks involvement first of all thats like saying youre missing the nsync concert because you dont like jts pipes benny was never bad at acting by any stretch of the imagination folks cite 2003s gigli and daredevil as fleck daddys downfall i cant speak to the former but a final thought on the latter at fourteen years old a group of friends and i thoroughly enjoyed daredevil in the theater plus it gave us a walk in the shoes of a blind person whether we appreciated it or not we were educated on a lifestyle none of us understood i can still cite multiple scenes in detail and i havent seen daredevil since that initial viewing my basic point is dont skip gone girl because of a strong opposition to afflecks acting ability rosamund pike is lightsout shes a semiunknown but a look at her filmography proves she deserves more notoriety ive a feeling well be seeing more of her in the future the remainder of the cast is just as good but too much detail may trigger a spoiler so ill leave it at that the warm weather left with the hummingbirds but at least there are solid flicks repopulating theaterspositive,This cant be called a feature film. This is a masterpiece like Beethovens symphony. It is an insult to call this a movie. No matter how many times you watch you love it. It is music to the eyes. While enough has been said about the plot characters comparison history context i wont delve into the specifics but give the review on a very high level. This applies to both the novice as well as the critic. From so many amazing things about the movie the greatest one is the music that is what has its effect on our minds while perfectly befitting the characters plot flow of the movie. Together with the characters of hero villain and the shady 3rd character the viewer feels he is the protagonist. Immersive. Joyous. Scary. Hopeful. The pace of movie the generous full blown action no holes barred spectacular scenes massive destruction grand setting is fabulous. Not a single scene act dialog in this movie I believe is not appreciable. It just blends in perfectly. Its a treat. You need this in your permanent collection and watch it in a home theater with full volume. listen to the tracks build an atmosphere of chaos cultivate a climate of anarchy darkness before you watch and even after the movie ends let the music roll on. This will stay with you for months. How the talented actors and the even more talented director pull off such a massive but delicate spectacular but deep grand but humane movie is a wonder in itself. This is my first ever review that too in 2013 5 years after the movie am still a fan of it. I saw the movie without any context of batman Nolan i simply stepped into a movie hall one rainy evening in Mumbai it was almost empty.... And at the end of it i sat alone contemplating how such a flabbergasting movie it cud be. i went home did some research saw this movie 5 more times including once in imax. My friends tell me im an ambassador of this movie but they liked it too. Although i went in too deep to understand the nuances character development dialogs and the working behind it. One of them rightly said this is NOT an action movie. Do not categorize it as such. Just because it is fictional it cant be miscategorised this is an opera a drama an anthropology of our times.positive,This a great movie If you liked this movie then I really recommend Reservior Dogs I just want to say one thing though What was in the briefcase Well I think its Marcellus Wallaces soul I think he sold his soul to the devil I say this because the combination to the briefcase was 666positive,Theres nothing in life more meaningful than endlessly talking about movies and theres no discussion as entertaining as fighting over which was the best year for films. I always go for 1994 mainly because it produced three movies that are truly unique and show up in every best of list you can imagine. I mean its pretty tough to find a person that doesnt have either Forrest Gump Pulp Fiction or The Shawshank Redemption in their personal top ten. While the first two movies still have a considerable group of opponents to some people Forrest Gump is too much of a tearjerker while Pulp Fiction apparently glorifies violence too much The Shawshank Redemption is one of those movies nobody can really dislike. Its a movie that goes beyond matters of taste the story writing and acting are so undeniably good that its tough to come up with a counterargument. Writer/director Frank Darabont is also a fantastic dialogue writer particularly when it comes to bit characters. You can also see this in the somewhat inferior The Green Mile characters who only have one or two lines say the perfect line on the perfect moment. The amazing performances by Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman do the rest. The best movie ever made Its definitely up there.positive,Theres a sag in the film Not in this film This is awesome. The trilogypositive,There will never be another superhero film that can beat The Dark Knights its unbelievably good. It continues on from Batman Begins showing a more experienced Batman in a darker Gotham City. The Dark Knight shows Batman pushed to his limits leaving the audience questioning whether he will give in. Everything you could want from a realistic batman film is there and I cant think of many ways that this masterpiece could be improved. Every scene is amazing and Heath Ledgers acting is better than any Ive ever seen before making it impossible to look away from the screen. It is not necessary to watch Batman Begins prior to The Dark knight however to fully understand the story Id recommend it as Batman Begins is an outstanding example of an origin story so you might as well see the full trilogy.positive,there is nothing i like more than a good thriller that is without a doubt my favourite genre that being said it is quite rare that i came across one that really has me absolutely gripped from the opening minute to the very last at best i have only come across some pretty great ones however gone girl definitely takes the prize for the best one that i have ever seen i wish that i had read the book first so that i could comment on how faithfully it has been adapted however since the screenplay is written by flynn herself i can imagine that it doesnt hold much difference only in the character depth which is always better developed through the work of a novel for obvious reasons what i can say though is that it certainly was safe in the hands of the brilliantly talented david fincher fincher is simply one of the best directors out there after all this is the same man that has given us such memorable gems as the social network 2010 zodiac 2007 panic room 2002 seven 1995 and many more simply put gone girl was destined for his spectacular direction and boy did he deliver gone girl is a remarkable piece of filmmaking on so many different levels the story itself is one of the most thought provoking and engaging that i have ever had the pleasure of viewing it had me wonderfully gripped right from the off its not often that i find myself dissecting and questioning the events throughout the entire thing but this one brilliantly had my mind rollercoastering all the way through it twists and turns with such unique and refreshing mastery that you feel like the whole thing is happening around you gone girl is the screen definition of a spectacular page turner and fincher delivers it with some of the best direction that he has ever done i cant help but think that in the hands of anyone else this film would not have been executed with the same quality of impact that the story deserved this for me is one of his best films if not the best no small feat considering his fantastic library of work a novel adaptation of this calibre though cannot rely purely on the talents of its director to tell the story without a great cast to act it out it is nothing more than a great story weakly portrayed fortunately gone girl succeeds in this too i get pretty sick and tired with the constant ben affleck bashing to be honest i dont think that anyone can deny that he is an awesome director and a talented writer ill say that straight off but whilst he may have been less than aweinspiring an actor in his earlier years ill defy anybody to tell me that he has not improved with age i think people just need to accept the fact that he is the next batman and stop being so ridiculous about it which is basically what it comes down to i see far bigger stars that have had much longer careers that dont have the fraction of acting ability that affleck does affleck is so multidimensional in the role of nick dunne that you really dont know what to make of him as a character all you can only ever really do is speculate on his guilt and innocence and formulate your own ideas concerning what may or may not have happened dunnes cocksure and blas demeanour is a fantastic shield when trying to determine the level of involvement in his wifes disappearance if any at all he is uniquely likable and dislikable at the same time this is absolute credit to afflecks performance and capabilities he completely nails and owns this character from start to finish that being said as great as he is i think the best performance of the film truly belongs in the hands of rosamund pike as nicks wife amy she is unarguably magnificent there is not too much that i can say about her character to be honest only that pike really does show the strength of her acting skills and i loved every moment that she was on screen overall gone girl is a splendid thought provoking mystery with plenty of twists and turns that will have you gripped throughout it is a marvellous guessing game and one you will still be talking about long after the end credits have rolled it is ultimately satisfying and rewarding in its climax and you wont get to the end and question why you bothered watching it in the first place gone girl also has a great supporting cast including neil patrick harris tyler perry kim dickins carrie coon and missi pyle among others if you have not had the pleasure of seeing this yet then i highly recommend that you get on it as soon as you can you will not be disappointed easily one of the best films of the year stunningpositive,there

a film that was shot for 12 years kept the exact same cast and delivered a powerful movie of a boy named mason its great to go and criticise movies but there was a moment that i could flaw this film with the unnoticeable changes of years it provides you with so many segments that create such power moods that you can relate to as a person growing up i call this a feel good film it has its funny moments and quite frankly was enjoyable all the way through there are dark scene that were delivered quite perfect that really left me pinned back in my seat after watching the trailer it was fair to say i had already classed this movie as beautiful and it sure was indeed finding a movie these days to please you is quite a difficult task whereas this movie has a simple plot growing up how you deal with yourself and what you will come across the movie really makes you feel as though you are growing up with it adapting to the really likable characters is consistent there is a lot of movies that have blew me away this year and by the forgotten director in my eyes linklater has really shown up to me and provides a movie that will feed your every instinct in what you love about a movie boyhood is beautifulpositive,There is no shortage to say that Peter Jackson and his staff of creators and actors have left its mark in the history of visual story telling for as long as time shall go. History will continue to revile this gem of our time and I feel lucky to be part of its birth and continuation to fill the hearts of love for films. Its visual achievements stand proud even ten years down the evolution of movie crafting and Howard Shore delivers a  which will define brilliance in motion picture soundtracks. It is truly one of the rare films I watch dearly once a year and still gives me chills smiles and touch the deep heartstrings I so seldom touch in real life. It is a reminder of the beauty in life and that darkness is but a passing no matter how great. It is indeed a movie which is pro-lifepositive,There is no other word to describe this film Everything from the casting to the choice of music is perfect in my opinion There is humour violence shock it has everything a film needs and they are all portrayed in a sensational way For people who havent seen the film it is a collection of stories all jumbled out of chronological order and all are somehow intertwined The individual stories themselves are wonderful and I would watch them on their own The way that Tarantino has put all the stories together so that we still arent sure how they all connect until right at the end is amazing The film somehow has a gritty reality to it even though some of the events that happen are ridiculous they are believable all the same The amazing thing is that Tarantino always manages to produce incredible films This is IMO the best film that he has made and probably ever made and for any fan or in fact anyone who has not seen this film yet go out and buy it nowpositive,There is no film that has touched me and few that have touched anyone as much as this one Tarantino has a penchant for violence as do many of the big name actors like Jackson and Willis But so does the human race Theres more to us and more to the film The fact that it creates so many unanswered questions the fact that I can watch it again and again and still see new things even its tie-ins to other QT movies all add up to a depth and complexity that uses violence and sex - it is not used by it Its ironic that such a pulp/pop film could do it but we live in a world of strip malls where we pick up donuts a world with pawnshops run by long-hairs with Reb flags and a world of people with accents from faraway places It adds to a mystery - Where is it from Fabiennes accent Why is she Esmerelda Villalobos here None of these are crucial to the plot Just like subway chatter and personal romance are not necessary for survival Yet we find ourselves doing them day in and day out Why does Marsellus have a band-aid Whats in the briefcase Why does mindless violence fascinate us Why are we enamored with the intricatepositive,There is no doubt that this film breaks through as one of the best film adaptations of a comic book. Christopher Nolan has taken the world of Batman and turned into real life creating a sense that how would the world of Batman look and feel if it was in our world. Right from the start in the opening scene shot in IMAX displaying a deep detailed view of Gotham you immediately become immersed in this film. As the film progresses you get drawn more and more into the film it starts to seem less fantasy and has a realness to it mirroring our real world. When casting of Heath Ledger as The Joker was released many people could not see him being this iconic villain Heath was sweet nice and had that gentleman quality to him that you see in his other films. When you first see him in the opening bank robbery scene when he takes his mask off you right away see that this was a new Joker that was not seen before with scars and messy make-up and messy hair. It has a sense of psychotic craziness with a hint of master mind that is unpredictable in nature but completely thought out in detail. In the later scenes you see The Joker only wants one thing and that is chaos to watch the world burn. He kills a few people without even passing a glance at them but can not find himself to kill the Batman it plays out as a Yin-Yang. Batman showing that the world is full of people ready to believe in good but the Joker shows how even the best can be broken down. You dont realize it is Heath behind the make-up and character you immerse yourself into thinking that is the Joker. The story has a mix of high action parts as well as slower parts bouncing back and forth creating a dynamic range that isnt to much or to little but keeps your attention through out. It is a true master piece that is a must to watch whether you are a die hard Batman fan or not it is a great movie through out.positive,There is just one thing that differentiates a legend from ordinary man. Its his fight with inner demons to over come all his fear. That defines a legend. And this is what Batman stands for. Batman is not just another comic character but its a complete saga of how you stand tall in spite of losing everything walk fearlessly even when you are lonely and how you fight back against all odds and over shadow your own fear. Fear- the most dominated emotion mankind has ever witnessed. Batman is no exception he still has fear he still gets scared of losing those who are close to him and he is still in doubts when it comes to decision. But what is interesting and inspirational about Batman is that he has the ability to use wisely the biggest and most dangerous weapons of all time perfectly- BRAIN Thats why he is my favourite comic character and this time Batman is putting everything on the line to save the world from out of control freak- the Joker. A spell bounded performance by Heath Ledger as the Joker. Though he is no more with us but his immortal act as joker is an Oscar winning performance and will always be remembered. Your heart comes out to mouth to see the horror Joker creates. In start I was bit confused as his performance reminded me of Jack Nicholson from the first Batman movie but later I realised that this is for real. He did not imitate Jack but showcased the true and horrible side of a real joker. The best part about Heath is that he displayed the flip side of a joker- FEARLESS. There are many times when we feel that some one could have done better with certain roles but not here. Here Heath is perfect as a joker and from now on I will call him Heath Joker Ledger The story is about a terror that has shaken the underworld of Gotham. The fear of Batman is getting in to criminal minds and all of them are now thinking where their money can be saved from Batmans reach. And thats where the Joker comes with a plan to these criminals- kill Batman. Now with his perverted mind the Joker is behind Batmans life and what follows is a scary hell of a ride of hide n seek game of faith vs. courage. At one end Joker has no fear and on the other Batman has a responsibility of saving Gotham. Now the important question is that who will win and more than that at what cost Apart from breaking box office records this movie is also able to break the pattern of film making. Batman series is an action series. When you make an action movie you give the required pace in a movie by focusing on elaborating the action scenes but here the director builds the movie with a mix of action as well as other emotional scenes. Step by step movie gives its audience action and emotion at the time when its required but with an unexpected style. Dark intense and a complete Batman style. The Batman movies are famous for its back ground music and The Dark Knight is no exception. Specially when there is sound of a whistle in background of some intense scenes in the movie. I felt a rush in to my blood and boiling my brain. My eyes popped out while watching those scenes. To mention Batmans grilling session with the Joker is a masterpiece. The scene was simply awesome mainly coz of background music. Harvey Dents character could have been better post he becomes 2-faced. I was expecting his character to be more involved and longer in the series. Rachel Dawes is also a very strong influencing character in the movie. Her involvement in the movie is much focused than Katie Holmes in Batman Begins but the point Im making here is the glam factor in this movie. She was not given that much footage in a glamorous way. Nevertheless the plot did not allow audience to think that way either. Action scenes in this movie are well thought of and will chill the audiences spinal chords. My favourite is the chase scene where Joker is trying best to catch Harvey Dent and how Batman comes in between. This is where Batman says asta la vista and welcomes his new girl friend- his damn new bike Its called Batpod I can imagine how excited you will be when you know that Batman is now going to catch the Joker and Joker is happy that Batman has missed his shot. This is sheer delight to watch the creative involvement of special effects blended with brilliant cinematography. Unlike other Hollywood flicks The Dark Knight is a lengthy movie of more than 2 Î_ hrs of non-stop adrenaline but you wont mind spending that much time watching it. Many times we feel that some movies couldve been shorter and some lengthier but with The Dark Knight thats not the case. Its mainly because the movie ends up at the time when it is required to scroll the curtains down. I was so satisfied while coming out from the movie hall. Perfect ending Well The Dark Knight is just a beginning. Now Im expecting the Penguin and the Riddler to come in to the picture and take this battle ahead. As I said earlier Im a big fan of Batman and after this movie Im mad about not just Batman but each and every part of his movies music and The Joker. Now while Im rushing straight to the nearest movie store to buy all original movies and soundtracks of Batman series you go ahead and enjoy a fearless life just like the Joker or Batman- choice is yourspositive,There is a reason the Shawshank Redemption has been at #1 of the IMDb top 250 for as long as I can remember. It is probably the best movie that has ever been made. Not because of the thrilling special effects it hardly has any. Not because of the daring experimental innovations it has brought us it is a quite straightforward movie. But because of its simple beautiful storyline and its great characters. They send you here for life. Thats exactly what they take. The strength of this movie is that Darabont is able to show what it means to completely lose are perspective and dreams for the future. To show how the people inside shed off their old lives and get used to the terrible life in Shawshank prison. We can truly understand how a man can become institutionalized. How people get used to living under a repressive regime and cant face changing it. We see how the old Brooks cant deal with the world around him and commits suicide. How Red faces the same challenges when he cant take a leak without asking permission. Inside the joint these men had a certain standing they were important people. Being set free is not easy when your live has been taken from you. - Why did you do it - I didnt since you ask. - You gonna fit right in. Half of the movie we dont know for sure whether Andy is guilty or not. It doesnt matter so much. What is important is not his past. Rehabilitated What does that word even mean In prison you live a whole different life. With whole different rules. Without a past. Or a future. Andy is the exemption. He shows us the remedy against becoming institutionalized. By never accepting our destiny. By never giving up. By always keeping our dreams alive. - There are places in the world that arent made out of stone. There is something inside that they cant touch. - What are you talking about -Hope. - Let me tell you something my friend hope is a dangerous thing. Hope can drive a man insane. You better get used to that idea. But Andy doesnt get used to that idea. He has received two things by the warden. Discipline and the bible. And he uses these two things to get out and escape to the paradise called Zihujataneo. There are two things that make this movie so extremely good. The first thing is that we all can relate to Andy. I must admit I didnt think much of Andy first time I laid eyes on him. He had a quit way about him. A walk and a talk that just wasnt normal around here. Andy is a normal guy. He is smart he is doing good. But he is not extremely strong or extremely smart or extremely rich. In other words: he is us. He is elevated a little bit above the criminals in prison but his two most important characteristics are characteristics that deep down inside us we all have: hope and determination. These two emotion are so strong and so pure that we all love to see the live of Andy. That is what makes this movie so appealing. And by living just your live as best as you can by never giving up and by keeping your dignity at all times we see that we can inspire people. Brooks was here. So was Red. Red didnt choose that path of Brooks. Red hasnt become completely institutionalized. Because he lived with Andy and dreamed a bit of his dreams. We the normal movie-watchers have never been to prison. And certainly there is nobody who can play the role of an older brother as the great Morgan Freeman and this might be his best performance of his live. Darabont shows a lot of skill in movie-directing and can let years pass in his movie without one moment losing our attention. There is a great soundtrack which breathes the smell of Southern America into our living rooms. But Im convinced that what makes this movie so great is that it inspires us all. We are not stuck in a prison but certainly we can be stuck in our lives. Change is hard and also outside of prison it is possible to become institutionalized. We can have a life that seems to have no past and not future. That seems to be unrelated to all the other things that happen in the world. Andy learns us to never give up. To never lose faith. To always keep hoping and dreaming about paradise. I guess it comes down to a simple choice. Get busy living or get busy dying.positive,There have been many cases in film history when a film is terrific do to the actors. Then there are some films are great because of what was written. With The Shawshank redemption IMDbs favorite film in works in both cases. The acting is superb and the film is incredibly well written and very justified. Tim Robbins plays Andy Dufrense a banker who has been accused of murdering his wife and her lover. So he is sent to Shawshank prison where he experiences lots of things. He forms a bond with Redplayed terrificly by Morgan Freeman. The wardenplayed by Bob Gunton hates him. He is raped. And all of this is leading to his escape after being in there for over twenty years. The Shawshank redemption which is based on a shot story by Stephen King is one of the most interesting films ever made. Ita also one of the best films ever made too. What is one way to tell: When you hear Morgan Freemans narration you know youre in good hands. The acting is explosive. Everyone does such a good job. The Shawshank redemption is a little long but the length is tolerable. Mainly because from the opening scene the film has you hooked. Morgan Freeman gives the better performance of the two but the duo of Robbins and Freeman is once in a lifetime. The Shawshank redemption was an Oscar upset. It was nominated for seven including Best picture Best actorMorgan Freeman and best writing. And it lost best picture to Forrest Gump which is also a great movie. 94 was the year of Pulp fiction also. Another Oscar upset. I prefer Pulp fiction but The Shawshank redemption is still one of the best films ever made. The Shawshank redemption:A+  there is blood gore limbs cut off people on horses being crushed and kicked through the air by giant elephants called Mumakil  you see orcs shoot a million arrows at an oncoming rohan army and when they hit the horses they flop to the ground and the riders hit it hard and are thrown  you see armies crushing other armies in waves literally  you see rocks from catapults hit and crush people in the wonderfully-made city immense destruction trolls whacking people and crushing them with their clubs and so on. There is a lot of violence i havent gotten to describe That explains the sheer immensity of this film And remember those gargoyles from the second film they call Nazgul Well lets just say Gondorian soldiers taste good and are fun to pick up and drop from 1000 feet in the air However violence and gigantic battles is not only what makes this film great. What makes it great are the characters who you love so much the music which is some of the best I ever heard and most of all the visuals. They are very amazing and beautiful. Even Minas Morgul the dark city of Mordor is an eye-catcher. The scenery of New Zealand-which is where this work of art was filmed-is just wonderful. The special effects are also some of the best ive ever seen. The oliphaunts nickname for the Mumakil the giant elephants are CGI but not obviously. They are some of the most real-looking fake images ive ever witnessed The soldiers which get crushed thrown the horses that are thrown they all look real too which is what makes the battle scenes frightening They look so real The best special effect in the film however is Gollum. He is also the best acted-character in the film and the best acted CGI character ever He practically is real from his emotions to his body to the hairs on his head His voice is also memorable i am trying to perfect doing it myself. He is a sight to see. The script is amazing the story is amazing everything is amazing This is one of my highest-recommended films. Thank you J.R.R. Tolkien for creating this wonderful story. Thank you Peter Jackson for interpreting this wonderful story to film. And thank you all for making this possible. 10 out of 10 positive,there arent many films that can capture you and absorb you for almost 3 hours boyhood did i went into it thinking it would be another inflated award nominated let down having heard about it for some time now and moving from excitingly wanting to see it to feeling as though the hype had taken over graciously i was wrong the characters and story whilst simple and quiet absorb you and lead you to invest in wanting to see how this normal life of a boy and family filmed for 13 years changes nothing happens? depends on the viewers perception of nothing and if its storytelling or spectacle you want i love both in films but would choose the storytelling characters and heart of boyhood over any recent films if not most films excellentpositive,There are very few people Ive met who did not like The Dark Knight 2008. They tend to dislike the fact that it is so rooted in reality but for me when compared with how outrageous the Batman mythos can get this is a major plus that wins this film 10 out of 10 stars. Lets start off with the best: Heath Ledger whilst different as The Joker incorporates so much from the Batman comics character into his performance that even though hes punk-ish and diverse in the role I totally bought him as being an updated version of The Clown Prince of Crime. His untimely death cheated the cinema of an up-and-coming name but this is such a great legacy for him to leave behind. This is not to say that I prefer him over Jack Nicholson or vice versa. What Nicholson did in Batman 1989 was loyal and apt for that film. But this film charts dangerous characters in a dangerous world that has clearly changed since Tim Burtons first Batman opus and Nolan proves that whilst the old Batman films may have been made for sheer entertainment value he is trying to convey a message to his audience. Whether you buy that message or not is all a matter of interpretation. The return to Chicago as the main spread of Gotham City was a fantastic idea and even though I miss some of the landmarks of the previous film particularly Wayne Tower I accept why Nolan changed pace with this sequel and hey at least the monorail makes a discreet return in some scenes here The use of locations is absolutely stunning. I am not sure if it was Nolans filming style or the fact that this film did things that seemed so new in an age where everything seems to have already been done but there are plenty of memorable stunts and dialogue sequences here. Unlike many I also enjoyed the character of Rachel Dawes and whilst I accept that Katie Holmes was a little inexperienced in Batman Begins 2005 her character wasnt used to being confronted by crooks quite as freaky as The Scarecrow was she Holmes replacement here by Maggie Gyllenhaal albeit complicating the continuity between the two films slightly seems quite appropriate. Gyllenhaal is more convincing in her work with both Aaron Eckhart and Heath Ledger but I agree that she is heartless and ungrateful to Christian Bales Batman/Bruce Wayne. But in many ways that adds to the poignancy of both this film and its sequel. Moving along to Harvey Dent you may be a Billy Dee Williams fan or a Tommy Lee Jones person but you cannot deny that Aaron Eckhart gives equal consideration to both Dent and his twisted alter-ego Harvey Two- Face. In fact I think that Harvey and Two-Face have rarely been adapted in a better way with one of the other great interpretations being Two-Face Parts I & II from Batman: The Animated Series. But this is the first live-action depiction of the character/s to really come through in showing both of them although I would have liked Two- Face to be carried over into another sequel. But we must not sideline Batman/Bruce Wayne must we Christian Bale continues to be one of the better performers to play Batman but I know that his gravelly Batman voice has irritated many. Sure Bales Batman voice is sometimes difficult to understand on a first viewing and is certainly hilarious when taken in isolation or imitated on youtube but if Bruce Wayne didnt disguise his voice it would be even more obvious that he was Batman wouldnt it Michael Caine again lends warmth and even more depth to his depiction of Alfred Pennyworth whilst Morgan Freeman remains charming and refreshing as Lucius Fox. Gary Oldman is given quite a wedge of the plot himself and it is interesting to see that whilst other actors to portray Jim Gordon were restricted in what the character could do he undertakes almost as much as the Dark Knight himself One other character from the previous film makes a playful and often overlooked return just after The Jokers opening bank robbery but it is awesome to see that Nolan didnt just shoot the scene using a stuntman. And the Batmobile and its successor remain the stars of the gadgetry rolled out for this instalment especially in a chase scene that will literally knock your socks off. In the gadgets section however there is a new sonar toy that can be disorienting to audiences on the first few viewings of the film but as you get used to it its not a lot of trouble at all. Hans Zimmer and James Newton Howard deliver a tense and exciting  that showcases The Jokers chaotic new theme whilst developing the themes for Batman and Bruce Waynes personal life as introduced in the previous film. On that note even though viewing Batman Begins isnt essential viewing for this instalment it has surprised me how many people were unaware of it before seeing this film. Its okay to miss out Batman Begins here but if youre intending to watch The Dark Knight and The Dark Knight Rises 2012 you had best watch Batman Begins first as you will be very lost when it comes to understanding the final instalment Anyway now that weve got all of that sorted sit back and enjoy a film that undoubtedly is a modern classic that raised the bar not only for comic book films but continues to serve as a massive inspiration in many other areas i.e. Sherlock The Avengers Skyfall etc.  it was made for anybody who loves a great story. J.R.R Tolkien knew that and so did Peter Jackson. And thats why the LOTR trilogy is so marvellously good. positive,There are very few films that can simply blow a human beings mind away but boypositive,There are only a handful of films that have shaken me to my core and continued to resonate with me for very long after their first viewing. I can happily say that The Shawshank Redemption has stuck to me since I finished watching it for the first time and instantly rocketed up my Top 10 Films list. Most great films have one or two obvious flaws that can be easily picked out - not so in Shawshank at least not to me. The hefty run time doesnt put me off because the story and characters are just so well rounded and so easy to return to time and time again. Shawshank is one of those films that I would love to experience for the first time all over again. The thrill of emotions and the highs and lows I felt that first time are incomparable to much else. In my opinion Forrest Gump was not as deserving of the Best Picture Oscar as this. The timeless feel of a story of friendship in a hopeless place will likely continue to capture generations of people for years to come.positive,There are only a few movies that one will see in their lifetime that affects the course of your life. I have loved The Shawshank Redemption since I first saw it but only recently had its powerful effect shown to me. In short order I lost my father to illness my wife to separation and my career to anger and dismay. Lost in depression mired in pain and alone in a large house I watched it again. Between Brooks suffering Reds hatred of hope and Andys response to his final isolation I stopped feeling alone. It is simple...get busy living or get busy dying. This movie gave me the strength to start over. The movie is popular for many reasons but it has a healing power for people trapped in their own Shawshank.positive,There are no flaws in TDK. The acting the story the characters everything was absolutely amazing. The highlight of this movie is obviously Heath Ledger. His brutal haunting and somehow charming performance perfected this movie. Christian Bale did great as Bruce Wayne/Batman. Though the character didnt emote as much as I thought he shouldve but its not CBs fault its the writers. Aaron Eckhart did great in the transformation of the hero to the villain Great great performance and cool effects on his face. All in all its a pretty amazing movie and i recommend it to anyone and everyone  you start slowly after a while you get attached by the time you reach the middle of the movie you simply totally forget about anything outside the screen and feel a mixed stream of emotions going through you head before anything else then comes a last 20 minutes of heart storming that is surely enough to raise the adrenaline to extreme levels even in diabetics I felt warm strong happy and all other emotions one can think of I felt I was the one who won who got out of prison i was simply fully satisfied. This movie must be used as an Anti-depression by therapists this movie proves that Oscars are either money bought gifts or that who ever in charge of them are so smart that they couldnt give any Oscar to The Shawshank Redemption knowing that the movie is on different - much higher- rating scale than the Oscars.. its simply over qualified positive,There are few movies that capture and identify with the American male spirit. Shawshank is one of those movies. I dont care what anyones take is on prison treatment or whether you are conservative or liberal this movie is moving. There are three movies in my opinion that every man or developing man should watch: Shawshank Redemption Dancing With Wolves and Brave Heart. Unless you are a total pansy these are the movies that will confirm your heterosexuality. Andy Dufrane is the person in us. Red is the person we want to be. Aside from the being in prison the job they have is well apt to the people of this great nation.positive,their are a lot of films now a days that are just so bland and uninteresting. but this film comes to none of that every second of this movie is just so fascinating from the dialoge that some characters share or just the insanity of the situations that occurs. in my opinion this film is just about how crazy life can get and quentin tarintino takes it as far as possible. the acting is great in this movie but even if this movie had terrabel acting it wouldent matter because this dialog is jut so realistic that any one can pull it off. but overall this movie just fascinates me every time i see this movie theres something new i notice about it. ill see the camera do something ive never seen before or ill learn something new about the characters i didnt know before. its a wild ride from start to finish. i adore this movie to deathpositive,The Ultimate action with a dazzling mind game incredible Acting Superb Technology Innovation with a tint of fiction makes this movie my One of the favorites. Finding the goodness even after you surrounded by evil souls and losing your dear ones is what the batman gives the message. Christian bale is the most deserving actor for this role and the great heath ledger RIP. The dark night rises is also a great hammer on the nail but it was no match to this one. Christopher Nolan work will be accredited lifelong. and it is his remarkable work which has left its mark on fans heart. For all those who hadnt got the chance take time its worth it and for those Who have watched it i bet you wouldnt have been got away with jokers magic.positive,The two best things about this film are the story-telling techniques and the imagery both proving that Quentin Tarentino is the finest film maker of our time The story jumps around in both time and place switching between a large set of seemingly independent characters and stories which all intersect to make a whole far greater than the sum of its parts And the juxtaposition of images is amazing: the rich drug kingpins wife overdosing on the floor of a low-level drug dealers home  the mob enforcers covered in blood in a suburban middle class house  Bruce Willis walking down some stairs carrying a sword wearing a white t-shirt splattered red with blood standing in front of a blue background and proving that there can be honour among thieves You dont so much watch the movie as experience itpositive,The true masterpiece This movie has a quite way defining the life struggles deep happiness and sadness. The director has completely understood the movie and so all his efforts we can see here. Nothing less than a Divine Gift to the World. Once anyone sees definitely he is going to repeat it a lot often. Andy Dufresne Tim Robbins and Red Morgan Freeman both have best performances. The best ending scene of this movie I have ever scene showing kind of Deja-Vu and Divine feeling to me. It is the movie about friendship and slow-redemption. You might not blink for a second to see what next it would lead to. Each character is fitted to their roles perfectly and they have given a flawless justification to that. A prison life is depicted in this movie which is looks vivid. I would say that this movie is aptly rated. This movie has a way to touch your heart by means of showing a true Hope.positive,The trilogy of the Lord of The Rings is the best trilogy ever made and it is amazing... Of course that dont have everything that are in the books like: -Tom Bombadil -Barrow Wights -Erkenbrand -The Grey Company -The Gondor reinforcements in ships from other cities -The Lords of Gondor like Elphir Hirluin... -Dol Amroth and Prince Imrahil and their charge to help the Rohirrim -Battle in the Shire -The Scout of Gondor that send the Red Arrow -Ghan-buri-Ghan and his people -Sam use the ring And other things but the movies arent the book is not because of that that the movie is better or worse the movie is an adaptation not the book... My advice 1st of all is to you see the extended versions have some more and cool details that make the trilogy better : The scenarios are amazing the mountains and all this the backgrounds are amazing I think it was a great production : So my congratulations to the all people that act indirect or direct in the movie and all the fans of Tolkien that make possible all this huge success... Now wait for the Hobbit : In short words: LOTR -> Epic : Sy for my English Portuguese here Regards Rodolfo Fernandes Costapositive,The third installment of Tolkeins masterful trilogy explodes to life on screen in ROTK. From the intro flashback scene to our final farewells I was literally on the edge of my seat. This film is like a rollercoaster ride at mach 1. My only small complaint is that I could have gone for an extra 10 or 15 minutes worth of Legolas and Gimli they felt slightly underused. All in all one of my favorite movies of all timepositive,The Third Installment Of The Lord Of The Rings Trilogy is by far the best of the three films. The Cast Of The Return Of The King Make The 3 and a half hour film fly by in what seems like a matter of minutes. In Seeing The First Two Films We already know That The Chemistry Of These Actors Is Amazing But in the third and final Installment we see the characters at the climax of their on Screen Performances. The Relationships Have Grown So Tight throughout The Trilogy That These Characters are more Realistic And Believable Than Ever. The Film Yet Again Shows Us Astounding Visual Effects And Some Of The Best Action Than Any Other Movie Of 2003. This Film Will Leave You Captivated And Wanting To See More And More. The Lord Of The Rings: The Return Of the King is without A Doubt One of The best Films Of 2003.positive,The third and final installment of the Lord of the Rings trilogy comes to life bigger and bolder than the first two. Director Peter Jackson and company held nothing back when it came to CGI special effects gorgeous landscapes and breathtaking cinematography. Fans most familiar with Tolkiens famed novels would take note of changes made in the interest of keeping the film short as with its two prior films but he stuck close enough the main story and brought it to its destined conclusion. He didnt water down the scene where Frodo finally gets to Mt. Doom in order to get rid of The One Ring once and for allŠ—”in fact it packs quite the punch. The way that scene was intermingled with the battle footage heightened the emotional level of the scene as well as the excitement. The actors deserve praise as well. Viggo Mortensen reminds us of what a hero truly is with his performance as Aragorn the man who would become King of Gondor. Sir Ian McKellen reprises his role as Gandalf the White bringing the Wizard to life as if he popped right out of the pages of Tolkiens novels. Elijah Wood draws us in with his portrayal as FrodoŠ—” Sorrowful and weary of his travels and all of the trials hed gone through along the way. Other noteworthy performances include those of Liv Tyler Cate Blanchet Miranda Otto Dominic Monaghan Billy Boyd Hugo Weaving etc. I highly recommend this film as well as its predecessors to anybody regardless of whether or not youve read the novels. Of course the books are betterŠ—”they always areŠ—”but the movies are an excellent adaptation of Tolkiens wonderful tale. This film is clearly worthy of the many Oscars it has won. I easily give it a 10/10.positive,The third and final installment of the Lord of the Rings trilogy comes to life bigger and bolder than the first two.

Christian Bale as Bruce Wayne is forced to make a great deal of judgment calls based upon the circumstances being piled against him by The Joker played by Heath Ledger. Unfortunately some of the choices and actions he performs cause him to become alienated from his closest friends and ultimately the city in its entirety. But in doing so he solidifies himself as the classic tragic hero that the city loves and hates in equal measure. Throughout the film Harvey Dent played by Aaron Eckhart undergoes a dramatic transformation through giving in to this darker side. He begins as what the people of Gotham City refer to as the White Knight due to his relentless pursuit of justice and for being a seemingly incorruptible source of good. As he is brought low by the machinations of The Joker Bruce is forced to sacrifice his own appearance of good to prevent Dents fall from grace from completely disheartening the already injured psyche of Gotham City. In keeping with the tradition of Batman Begins this film goes above and beyond anything I expected or hoped for. Bale Ledger and Eckhart form an engrossing triangle that keeps you at the edge of your seat throughout. With equal parts action and suspense youre never left complacent. The characters are so real that you find yourself getting sucked into their world almost immediately. Bale continues to make Bruce Wayne a believable albeit moody hero forced into making decisions that I wouldnt wish upon even my worst enemy. With a villain like the Joker many myself included were worried about whether he would be convincing as a source of evil as opposed to a quirky joke of a nemesis as has been too frequently betrayed in the past through the Batman franchise just watch Jim Carrey as The Riddler in Batman & Robin. Ledger gave a mind-blowing performance with equal parts cruelty humor and crazy. He created a persona so creepy yet brilliant youre almost always left in awe when he is on the screen. All in all a fantastic sequel that leaves the audience veritably foaming at the mouth for the next installment.positive,The story the action the heart The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King has it all. No matter how many times you watch it you will get goosebumps every time. Frodo and Sam are getting closer to Mordor with their guide Gollum while the rest of Middle Earth prepare for the great battle of their time. Other critics say that the movie uses excessive battle sequences and visual effects to fool the audience by blowing their minds. But the massive epic battles show the significance of the story. Gollum tricking Frodo to let Sam go Faramir facing inevitable death to earn his fathers love Aragorn finally stepping up to become king and a loving using friendship loyalty and courage to defeat evil. Not to mention Howard Shores masterpiece music.positive,the story of cinderella can be traced back to early egypt china france germany and many other countries from around the world the most wellknown versions were written by charles perrault cendrillon and by the brothers grimm aschenputtel there have been countless film television and stage adaptations of the iconic story but the most wellknown adaptation is walt disneys 1950 animated film i first fell in love with walt disneys animated film when i was just threeyearsold it was actually the first disney film that i ever saw as a child i can still remember being captivated by the story and singing along with the songs it was as though a spell had been cast upon me but the magic never wore off at midnight there were no words to describe the level of excitement i had when i first found out that disney was developing a liveaction film of the timeless story tonight i had the opportunity to attend an advance screening of the upcoming liveaction version of walts most beloved animated film what i enjoyed most about the latest animation to liveaction treatment is that its a relatively straightforward telling of the iconic story while alice in wonderland and maleficent were reimaginings cinderella is retold respectfully for the new generation lily james cinderella and richard madden prince charming were rightfully chosen for their iconic roles lily truly captured the true essence of cinderellas charm and beauty richard those eyes ahem was truly charming in every sense of the word i loved the chemistry between the prince and cinderella  i dont think ive seen such chemistry between two characters in a disney film for a very long time its very refreshing to see a fairy tale romance blossom cate blanchett lady tremaine and helena bonham carter fairy godmother were perfectly cast for their respective roles cate not only brought a lot of depth to her character but you could tell she was enjoying the role as the malicious stepmother helena not only brought a bit of comic relief to the film but she was definitely fun to watch  although you cant help but wonder if mrs weasley actually zapped bellatrix lestrange into a parallel universe hmm? i personally believe that disney made the right decision to hire kenneth barangh to direct the film and chris weitz to write the screenplay as i was watching the film on the big screen tonight i could tell that they both approached the story with deep understanding and most importantly respect i was genuinely relieved that it wasnt ruined by some unnecessary dark and edgy plot twist phew i absolutely loved patrick doyles  for the film and found it to be quite fitting with the story it was perfectly timed and it drew you into the fairy tale world i will definitely buy the soundtrack when its released next month sandy powells costumes though silly at times were excellent i dont think ive seen such beautiful designs in one film since the golden age of hollywood i genuinely hope sandy will be nominated for an oscar for those stunning costumes bravo the film itself is a visual marvel  especially for the fairy tale genre i was truly swept away by the lavish sets that were designed by dante ferretti i dont think ive seen such a breathtaking production since the late 1930s the special effects were equally breathtaking with the dress transformation and the carriagetopumpkin scenes being two of my favourite visual highlights im genuinely happy that disney kept the magic alive in this film very impressive my only disappointment was the running time of the theatrical cut i personally believe that it should have been 10 minutes or 15 minutes longer to flesh out the story more the film flowed smoothly and didnt feel rushed but there were a number of scenes and dialogue that were unfortunately left on the cutting room floor hopefully disney will release an extended cut or include those deleted scenes on the home media release you hear me disney? despite my issue with the running time i genuinely believe that disney did something right with their latest liveaction film while most people were probably expecting a swordwielding action hero im happy that disney treated their most beloved character with the uttermost care and respect the story of cinderella is very personal to each person who has felt like the underdog but managed to rise like a phoenix from the ashes in the end if walt disney were alive today im sure he would be proud to see his most treasured little savior be retold to the new generation in a beautiful and charming way bravopositive,The story as a whole is incredibly done everything from the camera work to the choice of words used. I also love how each character is so unique and well developed. So many small adjustments are made throughout the film to the characters make up for example which makes this such a well finished film. I highly recommend this to anyone who wants a brilliant film. 10/10. side note this is my only 10/10 film It is an emotional and thrilling film which has many plot twists. I feel like this is one of the greatest movies every made and i have many good reasons to think this. -Seanpositive,The simpler it was the better it became. The movie just showed me what I need to do in oder to become like him. Thats how great the movie was. A real detective story minus the characters cape and horns. The movies complex plot was a product good understanding of a simple story. I like the way Bruce Wayne was portrayed a renewed man pretending to be a spoiled brat. This is just a good way to hide his true identity by being what people expect him to be. Like the Art of War when you are strong you pretend that you are weak. A true player of the system so he can continue with his work. The Joker in this movie is just great evidence of great acting. When you begin to see the character and not the actor you begin to understand that Heath did a great job on the Joker. I remember the Joker not Heath. The movies theme and music became my last-song-syndrome great  by Hans Zimmer. The theme was really thought off and studied well understood the need of the story. All I can say is this is what great movies are all about.positive,The Shawshank Redemption.The best movie i have seen yet.Its adapted from a novel by Stephen King but this is a special film even better than the novel i suppose.Best adaptation yet to walk through in International Cinema. The great camaraderie between Tim Robbins & Morgan Freeman is very difficult to surpass.WowWhat an on screen display by both of them. If Robbins was fantastic then Morgan was emphatic.Brilliant acting by Tim Robbins.The best by him so far.Even he would admit.Morgan Freeman comes out with an en-lighted performance.His dialogs in the film are truly inspiring & heart aching.Fantastic work by him.An epitome of performance by Morgan Freeman.The rest of the casting is good.James Whitmore as Brooks is a revelationso is Bob Gunton as the warden. The plot is superb.Ending is classy.You can never make out what happened in the end.Its such a travesty that you have to watch it again.The directorial of Frank Darabont is top stuff whereas the screenplay by him is very much adulated.The dialogs are so memorable you will always carry them along.Here are some of the best dialogs from this: Andy Dufresne: They say it has no memory. Thats where I want to live the rest of my life. A warm place with no memory. Red: Let me tell you something my friend. Hope is a dangerous thing. Hope can drive a man insane. Andy Dufresne: Thats the beauty of music. They cant get that from you... Havent you ever felt that way about music Red: We sat and drank with the sun on our shoulders and felt like free men. This movie is the epitome of all others.No movie can emulate the camaraderie between that of those two Shawshank Prisoners.Must watch for a fabulous & thrilling experience.positive,The Shawshank Redemption undoubtedly deserves to be the highest rated movie. The movie depicts how a four lettered word Hope brings wonders to our lives and makes something impossible to possible. Though the plot of the movie focuses on how Andy Dufrane a falsely convicted prisoner gets out of the prison the beauty of the movie lies in the characterization of Andy Dufrane just amazing and how he influences his fellow prisoner Red. The narration by Morgan Freeman in the role of Red is perhaps one of the best narrations i have ever come across. This story proves that the king of horrors Stephen King is equally good at any other genre of Story WritingHats off. The dialogues towards the end of the movie about hope are truly inspiring. The background  of the movie is excellent. Tom Robbins and Morgan Freeman at their best in the roles of Andy Dufrane and Red respectively. Didnt watch the movie...go grab a DVD and watch it as soon as possible. Cant miss a movie like this....positive,the Shawshank redemption should be played throughout the world in all schools to teach people the hard life of prison but the bond between friends and the idea of hope. Morgan freeman is a second to none actor he lays the role perfectly and i could not think what the film would be like without him. all the other actors perform perfectly. this movie is a movie of inspiration and one of which will get people through harsh times. this film always restores my faith in mankind i simply love it. I first saw this film sitting on my brothers desk and i was intrigued by the idea of a film set in prison where hope and other morale values were the storyline instead of violence and havoc this is a amazing film which brings pride to the actors and crew who produced it. the setting of the movie is one of perfection the Gothic grounds and the stunning facilities astound me iam finding it hard to put in to words how much this film means to me i would say it is one of the greatest films ever made in my time and i love it.positive,The Shawshank Redemption is written and directed by Frank Darabont. It is an adaptation of the Stephen King novella Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption. Starring Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman the film portrays the story of Andy Dufresne Robbins a banker who is sentenced to two life sentences at Shawshank State Prison for apparently murdering his wife and her lover. Andy finds it tough going but finds solace in the friendship he forms with fellow inmate Ellis Red Redding Freeman . While things start to pick up when the warden finds Andy a prison job more befitting his talents as a banker. However the arrival of another inmate is going to vastly change things for all of them. There was no fanfare or bunting put out for the release of the film back in 94 with a title that didnt give much inkling to anyone about what it was about-and with Columbia Pictures unsure how to market it Shawshank Redemption barely registered at the box office. However come Academy Award time the film received several nominations and although it won none it stirred up interest in the film for its home entertainment release. The rest as they say is history. For the film finally found an audience that saw the film propelled to almost mythical proportions as an endearing modern day classic. Something that has delighted its fans whilst simultaneously baffling its detractors. One thing is for sure tho is that which ever side of the Shawshank fence you sit on the film continues to gather new fans and simply will never go away. Its possibly the simplicity of it all that sends some haters of the film into cinematic spasms. The implausible plot and an apparent sentimental edge that makes a nonsense of prison life are but two chief complaints from those that dislike the film with a passion. But when characters are this richly drawn and so movingly performed it strikes me as churlish to do down a human drama thats dealing in hope friendship and faith. The sentimental aspect is indeed there but that acts as a counterpoint to the suffering degradation and shattering of the soul involving our protagonist. Cosy prison life you say No chance. The need for human connection is never more needed than during incarceration surely And given the quite terrific performances of Robbins never better & Freeman sublimely making it easy its the easiest thing in the world to warm to Andy and Red. Those in support arent faring too bad either. Bob Gunton is coiled spring smarm as Warden Norton James Whitmore is heart achingly great as the Birdman Of Shawshank Clancy Brown is menacing as antagonist Capt. Byron Hadley William Sadler amusing as Heywood & Mark Rolston is impressively vile as Bogs Diamond. Then theres Roger Deakins lush cinematography as the camera gracefully glides in and out of the prison offering almost ethereal hope to our characters yes they are ours. The music pings in conjunction with the emotional flow of the movie too. Thomas Newmans  is mostly piano based dovetailing neatly with Andys state of mind while the excellently selected soundtrack ranges from the likes of Hank Williams to the gorgeous Le Nozze di Figaro by Mozart. If you love Shawshank then its a love that lasts a lifetime. Every viewing brings the same array of emotions-anger-revilement-happiness-sadness-inspiration and a warmth that can reduce the most hardened into misty eyed wonderment. Above all else tho Shawshank offers hopepositive,The Shawshank Redemption is without a doubt one of the most brilliant movies I have ever seen.What makes this film one of the best ever made is the message it conveys. It is one of eternal hope. Andy Dufresne played by Tim Robbins has been sent to prison for a crime he did not commit. But he never loses hope. He never gives up his quest to become a free man again. His years of tenacity patience and wits keep him not only sane but it gives his mind and a spirit a will to live. This film has a different feel to it. There has never been anything like it before and I dont know if there will again. The best movies are ones that touch the soul. It takes a movie like The Shawshank Redemption to touch the soul.positive,The Shawshank Redemption is without a doubt one of the most brilliant movies I have ever seen. Similar to The Green Mile in many respects and better than it in almost all of them these two movies have shown us that Stephen King is a master not only of horror but also of prose that shakes the soul and moves the heart. The plot is average but King did great things with it in his novella that are only furthered by the direction and the acting is so top-rate its almost scary. Tim Robbins plays Andy Dufrane wrongly imprisoned for 20 years for the murder of his wife. The story focuses on Andys relationship with Red Redding Morgan Freeman in probably his best role and his attempts to escape from Shawshank. Bob Gunton is positively evil and frightening as Warden Norton and there are great performances and cameos all aroundpositive,The Shawshank Redemption is undoubtedly the best best movie ever. The Oscars biggest mistake was giving Forrest Gump the awards that Shawshank deserved. Not to take credit from Forrest Gump which is also an amazing movie but it just cant compare to Shawshank. Morgan Freeman arguably delivers his best performance and Tim Robbins gives a performance that I feel is greatly underrated and also deserved an Oscar nomination. The films art direction adds to the storys beauty and gives off a feeling that fills you with hope. I remember seeing The Shawshank Redemption on sale for $5 at Wal-Mart and thinking I heard this is good so I bought it. Little did I know the film was worth more than gold. I bought the film and put off watching it for a couple weeks not overly anticipating watching it but finally decided to watch it when I was bored. I am a gigantic movie buff and have so many movies its almost pathetic but The Shawshank Redemption changed my entire view of film. Now every time I watch a movie I cant help but think It cant beat Shawshank. Some people say that this movie is overrated but thats wrong. Shawshank is an actual work of art to be compared with works of DaVinci and Picasso. When people say this movie makes them cry they dont mean to say its so sad but that they didnt know that something of such beauty could be conveyed on screen. I believe that if everybody sees only one movie during their life it should be this one. See it now. After that IMDb will seem like a whole new website because every film will seem like a different movie. It is by the very definition of the word magnificent.positive,The Shawshank Redemption is the best movie of all times according to over a million voters. When I saw this movie I was amazed because of the plot of this movie and that was something that made this movie so special. I also liked this movie very much because of the cast of this movie. Tim Robbins Andy Dufresne and Morgan Freeman Ellis Boyd Red Redding made one of the best performances of their life. Deserves to be noted that Bob Gunton Warden Norton made an also good performance. I really recommend this movie to you and I am sure that you will love it because its a movie that can teach you many things about life and the relationships between people and friends.positive,The Shawshank Redemption is one of the most touching and greatest movies I have ever seen. The movie is based on the novella Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption by Stephen King. Unlike most of his novels King didnt write a horror story but instead a inspiring tale of hope in unlikely places. Overseeing the transition from book to big screen is Frank Darabont who in his director debut s a home run with this movie. Not only does the plot pull you in but the actors do as well. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman do a fantastic job as the 2 central characters and as friends. Bob Gunton is great in the part of the villain as the evil warden. The directing cast and plot all combine to make the movie awesome. The plot of the movie revolves around Andy Dufresne a man who is imprisoned for life for a crime he did not commit. Over time Andy becomes friends with Red an inmate who runs the business of smuggling in things into the prison. The story then follows the 2 and how they handle prison life. Years go by but Andy continues to speak of hope. Ultimately Andy will commit unbelievable acts in a touching story that is truly inspirational. The message the story delivers is to never give up hoping. The climax of the movie is fantastic and the ending is one of the greatest in film history. Overall the Shawshank Redemption remains one of the greatest films of all time.positive,The Shawshank Redemption is one of the few movies adapted from books that turned out to be good .. or in this case brilliant. Although the movie supposedly takes place somewhen in the 1950s I can easily imagine it being transferred to todays time and standards. The thing that is most fascinating about is is that the directors [and writers of course] didnt use extreme clich’©s - theres no black and white painting just numerous shades of grey. Robbins and Freeman both are perfect for their roles as are all of the supporting actors. Finally I can understand why a certain movies gets a high ranking.positive,The Shawshank Redemption is one of the best movies I have ever watched in my life. Tim Robbins is really a good actor and thanks to him this movie is such a success. Also Morgan Freeman is really brought me the story. The story is excellentthe time has just flew with this movie. This movie just gets better with every showing. Theres no some special effects and that is just great-just men in prison uniforms talking to each other. Everyone must watch this movie.The Shawshank Redemption and To Kill a Mockingbird are the best movies I have ever seen. I do not judge it by its technical merits - I dont really care about that. I have read that Citizen Kane or The Godfather or this or that movie is the best movie ever made. They may have the best technique or be the most influential motion pictures ever made but not the best. The best movies are ones that touch the soul. It takes a movie like The Shawshank Redemption to touch the soul.positive,The Shawshank Redemption is most obviously one of the greatest movies in film history. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman make an unforgettable duo that captures the audience in magnificent acting and a well-written plot. There was not one moment where the movie did not hold my attention or seem boring. Therefore it indubitably earns a 10/10 and praise. A tale of two jail inmates/friends The Shawshank Redemption shines a light on the injustice of this world and the pleasures of freedom after years of confinement. It proves that through all the troubling experiences one man never loses sight of his dream. This not only gives Tim Robbinss character a chance of redemption but also chance for Morgan Freemans character to be inspired by an endless struggle that pays in the end. Everyone of all ages should at one point in their lives watch this movie to witness not only great entertainment but also an inspiring story.positive,The Shawshank Redemption is currently number one on the IMDb Top 250 list. I dont particularly agree with that but it is a truly great movie nonetheless. It is moving and compelling and it touches the heart and soul. The story is set in the 1940s and it involves Andy Dufrense Tim Robbins a young man who is convicted of murdering his wife and her lover and is sentenced to life in the Shawshank Prison. As one would expect he is very unhappy at first but then he leans that theres something deeper that nobody can take away from you: hope. As the story unfolds over the years Andy eventually becomes very influential within the prison and gains the respect of other inmates especially Red Morgan Freeman with whom he develops a special friendship. The story isnt original or creative and its relatively simple and a bit predictable but its compelling moving and memorable and theres a bit more to it which I wont go into. The movie puts the viewer right into the footsteps experiences and emotions of the characters. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman put on great performances. They really bring out their characters and offer true depth and emotion. One of the major moral messages of the movie is that a person may be imprisoned even for life but the spirit can never truly be imprisoned. The movie conveys this moral message very strongly and it truly touches the heart and soul. I am very glad I watched this movie. It is a truly emotional experience.positive,The Shawshank Redemption is an uplifting deeply satisfying prison drama with sensitive direction and fine performances. Freeman who is simply a great actor a man who has never struck a false note in his career both narrates this tale and anchors it with his authoritative playing. A passing reference to The Count of Monte Cristo offers a partial clue to what makes this movie compelling. Top-notch performances exceptional cinematography and masterful direction combine to make this film something special indeed. I love this film. Its a story about hope and dreams and one whose emotional impact is as great as the Pacific Ocean is blue. http://www.quantumvisionsystempdf.com  marvelous  stupendous  phenomenal  you understand what Im getting at. It is a true tale of friendship and love. Its an adventure all throughout  not only for the protagonists but the viewers. The effort put into the whole thing is just shocking. Each movie was released one year apart of the other and theyre all over 3 hours long. The script is great and so is the directing and everything else. There is no way this trilogy can disappoint. Definitely worth the eleven hours you put into watching it.positive,The Shawshank Redemption is an aesthetic adaptation of a much repeated clich’© where theres a will theres a way. It is a monumental piece of art that can chill thrill excite and rejoice any type of audience. It renders a remarkable story of hope trust courage determination and friendship while at the same time exploring the not-so-pleasant themes of corruption and police brutality. It tells a story of Andy Dufresne played by Tim Robbins a banker who is falsely accused of murdering two people. It shows Andys prison life as he tries to adopt to his harsh surroundings while at the same time developing a close bond with an aging but active inmate played by Morgan Freeman and his comrades. As the story develops Andy rises in popularity as the warden himself starts using Andy for his private business. The film offers a commendable soundtrack brilliant cinematography and an astounding storyline. Both Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman are exceptional in their performances moreover Bob Gunton also gives a brilliant performance of the villainous warden. On the whole this film offers its viewers a kind of emotional enlightenment a kind which forces every viewer to reevaluate his stance on his life and goals. A must watch 10/10positive,The Shawshank Redemption is a timeless story of heartbreak deception and ultimate growth under the most deplorable conditions. The acting is superior some of Tim Robbins and Morgan Freemans best work as they allow me an intimate look inside the sometimes contradictory nature of a convicts existence where I am torn emotionally between danger and safety light and shadow sanity and sorrow truth and lies injustice and justice. In fact I am lost in all the actors poignant and memorable portrayals of young thugs cruel guards swindlers thieves rapists and murders all standing in their respective spaces quietly listening together to an operatic aria over a loudspeaker on the prison yard. In this movie I find almost no one to be all good or all bad. There are exceptions though. Although there are those in charge of the prison I wish to be caught in a snare of their own making or worse there are still others behind prison walls that turn out to be heroes I cheer on to win in the end. Like people in real life most of the characters in The Shawshank Redemption both prisoners and guards those that are not miserably rotten to the bone represent many shades of gray. One of the most touching moments in The Shawshank Redemption is a scene in which an elderly convict who has spent the better part of his adult life locked up is brokenheartedly paroled into a modern world that is as alien to him as his outdated suit and boyhood memories. And his fear of this new and unnatural terrain crawling with shadier creatures than those he had known behind bars and the exhaust fumes of a thousand horseless carriages rushing past engulfed him with no hope of ever escaping. Fear can hold you prisoner. Hope can set you free from The Shawshank Redemption. As bonds form between people of different ethnic groups economic backgrounds and intellectual levels I rejoice in their discovery of the human dignity they share. As the story unfolds my heart hurts so hard I cry. Then with tears still in my eyes I laugh the same way my family used to laugh together at dinner or a movie when I was a little girl. Getting older. Times changing. People leaving. Dying. But at the core of the main characters spirit there shines upon all those who are within its range including me a contagious hope eternal. I am still astonished with the euphoria that fills my being each time I view this incredible story about the invincible human spirit.positive,The Shawshank Redemption is a story of life itself. It is not about a person in prison it is about the soul and the battle it accepts and carries on to deserve the life it has been given by God. I watched the movie for the first time some months ago. That evening I was about to go out with some friends but out meeting was canceled and I had to stay home. Being unhappy about that I started watching the movie on the TV just by chance not knowing about its existence before that at all. At first I was skeptic I admit that. But oh God at the end of it I was screaming and jumping in my room at 1 AM It gave me so much emotions and so much hope I had never felt before that. I could hardly believe that a movie could make me feel that way - so excited so happy about my life leaving me believing so much in my own self. It is a great story of what the strength of your thoughts can make you do. In The Shawshank Redemption desire does not make you weak just the opposite - gives you wings to fly away from fear fly closer and closer to freedom. Morgan Freemans voice is just another advantage that makes the movie even more impressive. Tim Robbins act is just beyond perfection I bought the DVD this summer and every time I feel weak or just bad about something I watch the movie. It has become my personal shrink making me feel strong enough anytime I watch it. Can never imagine a better movie made anywhere in the world even after 1000 yearspositive,The Shawshank Redemption is a movie that will really never ever be forgotten. Arguably the best movie of all time. A thundering reassurance in the hope for a better tomorrow this movie is truly an epitome of hope and perseverance. Probably should be filed under the category of movies you should watch anyhow before you die. True masterpiece. There wont be another movie that can be quite anything like this. This movie is so powerful that I cant even describe this in a few words. This is the kind of movie that rekindles hopes in all of us. The kind of movie that will always keep moving and impressing generations to come. With a storyline that not only will blow you away but also strengthen your hopes and faith in the fact that Hope is a good thing. Maybe the best of things. And no good thing ever dies.positive,The Shawshank Redemption is a movie that creates a sense of mystery and power. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman carry the movie by displaying their roles as best friends. After watching that movie for the first time I remembered clips that are drilled into my mind forever. It is beautifully written and directed. The scene that sticks out to me is at the end of the movie when Andy Dufresne and Ellis Boyd Red Redding reunite at the end of the movie. This promotes the aspect of friendship that will live on forever. Even though these two men have lived in prison for years they eventually got out well Andy escaped and they still managed to find one of the most important things in their lives each other. I recommend this movie to all ages. Although this movie may be a complex the first time you watch it but after several other times it still creates a sense of thrill and hope for the viewers. 10 out of 10positive,The Shawshank Redemption is a movie about time patience and loyalty -- not sexy qualities perhaps but they grow on you during the subterranean progress of this story which is about how two men serving life sentences in prison become friends and find a way to fight off despair.The shawshank redemption is a brilliant film that is beautifully acted with and insbiring and uplifting message message of hope. in my opinion the film should have at least one Oscar to show for its brilliance. it is truly sad that know one could see how superior shawshank is to the wearisome Forest gump. i think that if shawshank had been released more recently it would have hands down won best picture it is one of the few films that are worthy of being called perfectpositive,The Shawshank Redemption is a magnificent tale of friendship and hope. Led by great acting all around it is a almost flawless movie. Morgan Freeman is at his best in this film. This has been my favorite movie since I was a teenager and I think its going to last a while. The movie as a whole is incredible but the ending is what made the movie my favorite. After watching Shawshank I was unable to think for several hours. The movie put me in a trance that consisted of me just taking in what I have watched. I have never witnessed such an incredible ending to anything in the movie industry. A must see for anyone who enjoys a good movie I promise it will not disappoint.positive,The Shawshank Redemption is a brilliant movie with a fantastic and inspired story linebased off a short story by Stephen King and a terrific and truly inspired casttheir isnt very much not to like about this movie.It is currently number one on the IMDb Top 250I definitely dont think it deserves to be number onethe Godfather is betterbut I do think it deserves to be high up on the list.Tim Robbins is great in this moviebut Morgan Freeman is the really star.Anyone who likes crime dramas and prison break movies will love this movie Andy Dufresne Tim Robbins is sentenced to two lifetimes in prison when he is framed who killing his wife and her secret lover.He is miserable but soon makes a good friend in the wise Red Morgan Freeman.positive,The Shawshank Redemption did not win Best Picture because it will remain to be an example of how a movie does NOT need to win some sort of award top be considered one of the most prolific experiences an acting production can make someone go through. This is not just a movie...Its an experience that everyone need to partake in. I have maybe only seen about 450-500 major motion pictures with about 80% of them being produced after 1980 BUT THIS IS THE ONLY MOVIE OUT OF ALL WHERE I ACTUALLY FORGET THESE ARE ACTORS ACTING IN FRONT OF A CAMERA WITH A MOVIE CREW. Do you know what that means --It means not only Frank Darabont but every single person involved in this film fused so well that they truly made a piece of artwork that puts people in such an emotional trance they forget whats happening for 2 hours. THIS IS WHAT EVERY DIRECTOR AND PERSON WHO WORKS IN THE FILM BUSINESS DREAMS ABOUT...MAKING A MOVIE THIS GROUNDBREAKING. The Shawshank Redemption will show you how true friendship can arise from anywhere...Even in a prison--where people fear the most to be in. --Maybe it shows the intrinsic drive humans have to create a social bond in any situation. Sometimes when I talk about this movie to people I feel really disturbed when someone has not seen it. I feel like saying are you insanepositive,The Shawshank Redemption came out in 1994 and was an absolute flop but found its real audience in home video peaking as the most rented video of 1995 in the USA. A wonderful film that takes you into the prison experience of RedMorgan Freeman and Andy Tim Robbins. Andy being a banker convicted of murder and Red a murderer already serving time this movie takes you to the limits of human endurance where the human spirit eventually prevails. The TSR takes you on an emotional journey that you will remember for a long time thanks to the superb crafting of the film and sincere performances by the cast. The  is deep and haunting this film is for the ages and will permenantly have a place in my heart. To me it is the best film of the 90s and quite possibly one of the best of all time. The fact that this film is sitting at No.2 is a testament to just how many people love this film many viewers seem to have an emotional bond with the film and I dont blame them. I only wish that I could view the film for the first time again and experience that redeeming feeling Andy and Red experienced at the end. Ignore the hype surrounding the film and judge it on your own experience the last half hour are especially beautiful. Watch this if you already havent and enjoy the masterpiece that Frank Darabont has so gracefully given us the privilege of viewing. 10/10positive,The Shawshank Redemption as a film is the most powerful and moving films I have seen and regard it as the best of all time yes there are many grate film out there many that are over looked by many people but as this film has shown box office ratings mean very little in the grand stage time a film that ca be classed as a true classic is one like this thats stands the test of time with grate acting and filming this one move people in ways other films can only hope to do. An it transcends all ages and class with a true hart felt tale of two men over coming adversity in a truly horrible place like the Shawshank prison in this way it moves me to think how would i cope in that place if i could at all stand that kind of life for that long but it has a lighter side to it as Andy get one over the Worden and escapes the cells to freedompositive,The sequel to Batman Begins received much hype and delivered more than what was expected.With fast-paced action an awesome plota great hero and a menacing villain.It was a battle of the brains in which the JokerHeath Ledgerultimately won causing BatmanChristian Bale to accidentally kill Harvey DentAaron EckhartAKA.Two-Face.Ledger produces his memorable performance winning an Oscar.also starring Gary OldmanMaggie Gyllenhaal. N.B NOT FOR KIDS -Ambrose Amituanai Sydney Australiapositive,The second part of the trilogy of Christopher Nolan Batman is definitely the best movie based on a superhero already made. And it has it all great characters and actors visual and sound incredible atmosphere and a dash up to all of the above. As much as you disappoint the previous installments of Batman do not stop viewing the work of Nolan. Only the new installment of Superman Man Of Steel or the third part of the trilogy of Batman can approach this huge film. Finally especially mention the great performance worthy of an Oscar the sadly departed Heath Ledger in the role of the Joker which makes even forget the previous Joker Batman Jack Nicholson.positive,The rock n roll packaging is a spoonful of sugar for this movies theme: damnation or redemption Every character is either redeemed from their sins or damned for them  theyre either angels or devils or souls beset by the latter and in dire need of the former to show them the way out But who would care if PF hadnt been so well written directed produced or even acted in the first place positive,The Return of the King was possibly the most-anticipated film ever the previous two installments of The Lord of the Rings having instantly ingrained themselves on the movie going publics consciousness. Personally I held little fear that the film would fall victim to the dreaded cinematic condition of sequelitis and fail to live up to expectation. But only the actual release of the movie an agonising year after The Two Towers would remove this uncertainty and fulfill my desire to see on the big screen the end of one of the great stories. As with The Fellowship of the Ring I need not have concerned myself. As a spectacle The Return of the King is by far the most impressive of Peter Jacksons landmark trilogy. Unfortunately like TTT it has flaws but fortunately these are not fatal. Jacksons great triumph is that even with all its CGI wonders his film does not neglect its characters in particular the relationships between Gandalf and Pippin Eowyn and Theoden and of course Frodo and Sam. Each resonates in the memory. Even in the midst of battle Jackson focuses on the people into which he has invested so much time and care. Its a shame Hollywood in general is blind to the possibility of overwhelming spectacle co-existing with the human element of cinema. The intercutting between the battle in front of the Black Gate and the desperate struggles at the Crack of Doom is just stunning with the expressions on the faces of the each of the Fellowship members underlining what a tour-de-force of storytelling this movie is. The relationship of Frodo and Sam becomes the centrepiece of the movie more and more as it goes on. This is the way it should be because their parting at the Grey Havens is the last act of the story. Jackson shows that his sensitivity to Tolkien is still there in spite of the harsh verdicts of many who disapprove of the changes from book to film. Ironically the clamour of too many endings by those who hadnt read the book demonstrates why the earlier changes had to be made. A lot of story had to go into this movie but this is necessary for the following reasons. In TTT there is a convenient pause in the story between Helms Deep and the Isengard reunion. After Pippin looks into the Palantir the momentum is unbroken in the FotR movie until the end of the great battle inside and outside Minas Tirith. Thus a great deal of TTT book narrative was still to be shown because the movie of TTT left out many of the last chapters. There was no place for the Voice of Saruman chapter at the end of TTT because in cinematic terms it would have been too anticlimactic but more about that later. Also Jackson really has no option but to put Frodos and Sams fights with Shelob and the battles for Gondor at the same stage of the movie. This makes so much more sense than separating them and having to handle a buildup in tension then the Shelob fight then another tension buildup before the great battle for Gondor. The structure of the movie would have been too cumbersome. Anyway when Tolkiens chronology in the appendices is read you realise both events happen at nearly the same time. The worst consequence of the packing of so much narrative into this movie is the underwritten character of Denethor. He is totally unsympathetic which is a mistake because in the book he is much more interesting. Jackson should have found a way to include Denethors struggle with Sauron through the Palantir because this is the real reason for Denethors madness. In this film the cause is his grief over Boromirs death which also partly explains his treatment of Faramir but this sells the character of Denethor short. Not only that but also the death of Denethor is perhaps Jacksons worst error of judgement. The fiery 100 yard dash and plunge over the edge is just ridiculous. There is nothing wrong with the arrival of the Army of the Dead to win the battle but its just not as stirring as the end of Helms Deep battle. The high point of RotKs battles is the charge of the Rohirrim and their fight against the Mumakil ie giant elephants which tends to make the actual of end of the battle a let down. Wisely Jackson does not focus on the green tide washing over Saurons hordes instead he cuts back to Miranda Ottos wonderfully passionate portrayal of Eowyn killing the Witch-King then throws in the now-famous single-handed bringing down of a mumakil by who else Legolas of course. No discussion of this movie should neglect the Extended Edition DVD. Possibly the greatest flaw in the theatrical version of RotK is the omission of the Voice of Saruman scene and insertion of a silly misleading line of Gandalf that Saruman had lost his power. But unfortunately as with the omission of the sons of Denethor scene at Osgiliath in TTT the scene breaks the flow of the movie too much and given the three hour plus running time this decision was understandable. As with TTT Jackson is given a get out of jail card by the EE on which Sarumans demise can be seen for the first time. I am sorry to say that I was not as generally impressed by the RotK EE as I was by the EEs of FotR and TTT. Jackson is too self-indulgent with Gimlis character. In the theatrical version of RotK I didnt mind these gags but in the Paths of the Dead scene in particular I found that Gimlis antics spoiled the mood of horror and dread that should have been maintained. All of that being said the EE still deserves the highest recommendation. It adds many important details such as Eowyn and Faramir falling in love. The LotR movie experience is incomplete without it.positive,The Return of the King is the third and final film in the Lord of the Rings saga. Peter Jacksons portrayal of the film is a masterpiece in an already stunning trilogy. ROTK is an epic tale of sacrifice courage and friendship. Frodo and Sams journey to Mount Doom is scary and filled with heart breaking moments of triumph and defeat. Elijah Woods once again portrays Frodo wonderfully as well as Sean Astin. The rest of the fellowship are very good in all of their scenes especially Viggo Mortenson and Ian McKellan as Gandalf. Visually the cities and battles are simply fantastic and very realistic. This has been a long journey of film starting with the Fellowship 2 years ago and now it has ended wonderfully.positive,The Return of the King is the spectacular finale to the already fantastic first two movies in the Lord of the Rings trilogy. This one is the best. Aragorn takes the lead role this time as he faces his destiny to become the king of Gondor. Gollum motion-captured Andy Serkis is becoming a big problem for Sam Sean Astin as Frodo is beginning to trust the creature more than Sam himself. And Pippin Billy Boyd pledges his allegiance to Denethor John Noble the crabby and evil stand-in leader of Gondor. Denethor doesnt have the best attitude in the world such as when he tries to burn his own son alive. The ending is very long but it isnt bad. The entire movie is riveting magical cinema and I ate up every minute of it. The Return of the King is a masterpiece and of course it grossed hundreds of millions no doubt more than that actually. 4/4positive,The Return of the King is the best movie ever made to the best trilogy ever done. This movie deserved the eleven Oscars it got including the Editing. Without the editing this movie wouldve been over four hours long. Even though this movie is about three and a half hours it dies not feel like it. The scenes are intense and can tend to be emotional. Gollum is the show-stealer again. As the ring is taking Frodo away from strength Gollum uses that to get the ring back eventually and drive Sam away. It was kind of sad to see Gollum die along with the Ring in the fires of Mt.Doom. Aragorn deserves to be king of Gondor. He was amazing in this movieplayed by Viggo Mortensen. I am glad that Legolas and Gimli were used for comedy. With all the drama and action there needs to be a bit of comedy before the action overwhelms the movie. The acting is perfect. I liked most of the characters. It was sad when Theoden died. He was great in this series. The music by Howard Shore is even better. You can hear some Celtic tunes during some scenes. I loved the song Into The West by Annie Lennox. The effects and the CGI is excellent especially during the battle scenes towards the end. Peter Jackson really put his name into the record books. This is the best fantasy epic in fact the best movie of all time. I rate this movie 15/10if the rating system went any higher.positive,The Return of the King is my favorite movie. It concludes a marvelous trilogy directed by the genie Peter Jackson  This last opus has absolutely everything a spectator can dream of: incredible special effects that even in 50 years wont seem outdated actors that believe in the story they are telling us if you check the DVDs bonus youll see how all actors were deeply attached to their characters music that will lift you up to the clouds a story certainly inspired by Tolkiens Books but still really catchy but in another hand Jackson edited the books to make movies even more interesting and I could go on and on and on ... Congratulations to all the ones that have contributed to the making of this film positive,The Return of the King is a film full of ambition. That is what truly sets this film apart from so many similar fantasy adventures. The scope and scale of this film was enormous I do not think that there has ever been a film made with one quite as large as this one and Im not sure there will ever be another. Though not only is Return of the King a true epic through and through it also has a ton of drama. This film has so much emotional resonance and it achieves this by simply playing off of these wonderful characters and who they truly are. When Sam picks Frodo up and carries him up the slope of Mount Doom one would almost feel their eyes begin to tear up. This film is not only a terrific actioner but it is also a beautiful film that might even force the more hardened moviegoers to shed a tear before all is said and done. When it is over there is no denying that the Return of the King is one of the greatest achievements ever captured on film. I give the Return of the King a perfect 10 out of 10positive,The plot is simple but hard to explain It is basically a story telling the intertwining lives of two mob hit men a gangster a gangsters wife a boxer and two robbers This film has a fantastic cast from John Travolta Samuel L Jackson Bruce Willis Uma Thurman Tim Roth Amanda Plummer and Ving Rhames I think I missed someone out but yeah its a pretty good cast They deliver their lines so naturallypositive,The perfect ending of the best epic movie in the history. Do not try to compare the first or the second movie with this you must see it as a 10 hours movie. Sorry there is no Lord of the rings next year...DAMM  the film is just a big crazy amusement park. Most important to me though and Im sure many others would have to be the storys structure. Have you ever seen a chronological timeline of the film Its crazy. Its like when the film is in the correct order it doesnt make sense anymore. It wouldnt fit the film because its too much fun for an A to B. The way Quentin Tarantino weaved the films content together is so extremely impressive because it works so well. The film just flows. The transitions are so fluid. And the story itself is just so interesting that the way it shifts around itself creates so much intrigue and makes it so thrilling. Just as integral as the way the story is presented is the characters that present it. Vincent Jules and Butch are really just normal people in the world of Pulp Fiction but to the viewer theyre so much larger than life. Not only do Vincent and Jules have an unforgettable chemistry as partners but what was really incredible to me was the chemistry Vincent and Butch had as enemies without even really knowing each other. The conflict between them created by just two encounters is astounding. Jules though Jules is excellent. A great character played by a great actor. Samuel L Jackson steals every single scene hes in. His monologues are legendary. This man must have needed some great vengeance AND furious anger to be able to deliver those lines the way he did. He was one bad mother. I remember seeing parts of the film as a kid and wondering what the rest of it would be like. I thought seeing the whole movie would be like opening pandoras box on my concept of what a movie could be. Looking back I think I was right. positive,The path of the rigtheous man... When you hear this Im sure you still get the chills. The best 90s movie because of the plot because of the changes that Tarantino made in the perception of time in films. Because of the astonishing performances of everyone in the cast. Because of the soundtrack... A movie that nobody will ever forget.positive,The opening sequence which most people have seen online due to the footage being shown on some trailer reels sets the stage for the entire film. An eerie  brilliant directing and spot on acting. There isnt too much that I feel comfortable saying about this film that hasnt already been said a thousand times and wouldnt give anything away. I will tell you that The Joker is incredible. The trailers thankfully dont really give away too much of Heath Ledgers incredible acting so I recommend seeing it for yourself. A lot of people are complaining about the length of the film but the film covers a lot of ground and shortening it would be murder. Go see this while you can its a classic and raises the bar for all super hero films.positive,the muchanticipated interstellar arrived and immediately created massive explosions both on film and in

gets more than just fiction. The directions so perfect action so realistic performances like never seen before music to die for  awesome cinematography OMG its superb. The dialouges feels so crafted and well defined and the joker is flawless. Chris has done a brilliant job  and the whole cast is brilliant. With the usual real world scenarios and talksit shows the unexcepted and awesomely scripted every scene that you wont get bored even if you are a not so die-hard batman fan or something. Marvel superheroes those lame iron man and thor should learn from this  not forced like so many other actors. Tim Robbins displays his acting ability beautifully and captures the audience with an intense amount of emotion which seems to resonate in his eyes. The genius and wisdom of the character he portrays is a fascinating thing to watch unfold as the story lays itself out like a poster of Rita Hayworth. To say that this movie gives the audience hope would be unfair because this movie makes the audience want to live love experience life for all of its pleasures and its faults. It makes one appreciate the simple things and slow down a bit to admire that which we pass a hundred times a day but never truly see. To describe this movie as great would be an understatement because it is so much more than that. While it is brutal and realistic it portrays humanity at our best and our worst providing the audience with a mirror in which to reflect what lies within. By the time the credits roll were left speechless...and at the same time wanting to share this masterpiece with those we love and cherish. Everyone should see this movie at least once in a lifetime to make us appreciate everything we have. Who would have thought someone could capture humanity this way I guess a picture really is worth a thousand words...... positive,The movie was spectacular. The trilogy cannot be described in any word nor any string of words put together to form a phrase or anything else. It was unbelievably impressive. Starting with the movie once again the acting was phenomenal. The emotion evoked and the empathy one feels for the characters is truly sincere. Its amazing at how a movie can be four hours long yet not feel as if it was more than three or two and a half. The visual effects are incredible. The trilogy as a whole is unbelievablepositive,The movie was Great and the acting of Christian Bale was out of this world.I think he is the best actor of Present Era. THE STORY LINE OF MOVIE WAS GREAT. The only Shortcoming that i see is when they attack the city and the scenery they show of city is not very good  very suffocating. Beside this the Movie was Great.The movie has live up to the expectation. The message given in the film is very good. I want to salute the guy who have written the dialog of this Batman Movie series. The Dialogue are just amazing and their delivery is killing. you want to hear the dialogs again and again . believe me. The Gadgets of the Batman are amazing. I specially like to talk about the caretaker of Wayne House. Mr. PennyWorth He has done his role very Effectively. In The Nutshell  The Movie is GREAT and totally worth your money.positive,The movie was directed by Quentin Tarantino and is considered to be a turn in the history of Hollywood cinema It was released on 14th October 1995 and maintains its position #5 in IMDbs top 250 list ever since The great thing about this movie is the its non-linear storyline which keeps the audience interested It revolves around the lives of two mob hit men a boxer a gangsters wife and a pair of diner bandits intertwine in four tales of violence and redemption The thing that most amused me is long duration continuous shots and the brilliant acting done by Samuel L Jackson John Travolta and Uma Thurman This movie has some great all time favorite dialog like I dare you I double dare you and many more The music in the movie is great as it very well keeps the pace and rhythm of the movie and keeps viewers interested Coming to the composition of the movie the sudden movement of space and time is very well composed and directed The movie starts from present goes into the past then jumps to future and comes back to the present This is very well crafted so that the audience do not get confused Coming to awards and nominations it won an Oscar for the best writing and screenplay and got numerous nominations for best picture best actor best actor in the supporting role best director and many more Overall it won 62 awards and 46 nominations and an Oscar which is a sign of great movie So I would like to conclude by saying that it is indeed a great movie to watch with good plotacting and direction and one should watch it at least oncepositive,The movie that shot director Quentin Tarantino into popularity pulp fiction still stands as his greatest movie and one of the best movies ever created The film follows multiple inter-connecting plot lines: Samuel L Jackson and John Trovolta play two hit men searching for a stolen briefcase Uma Thurman plays the boss mans wife out on a date with Trovolta Bruce Willis plays a boxer on the run from gangsters ands Tim Roth and Amanda Plummer play a couple robbing a diner The plot is structured brilliantly and is told out of order which makes things even more interesting The film features most Tarantino trademarks including his normal chunky dialogue with some of the most quotable lines in any film ever contained here The films also not shy on action and theres loads of surprises throughout the moviealthough I wont spoil anything Acting wise pulp fiction features one of the greatest casts in film history Jackson gives what is undoubtedly the best performance of his career as the bible spouting hit man while Trovolta gives another great performance in the role that resurrected his career Thurman also acts brilliantly as the sexy but mysterious wife to the main mafia boss The supporting cast is strong with Harvey Keitel playing the gangster expert and even Tarantino himself has a small but hilarious role But thats not the only reason PF is so great its everything about it The soundtrack is classic Tarantino with tons of pop culture tunes used to add to the story While the camera work is some of the best since the films release And the film just keeps on giving from its smart opening scene which carries the whole movie to its hilarious middle acts to its hugely satisfying conclusion As it stands pulp fiction is still one of the funniest darkest most enjoyable and most creative films ever If you havent seen the film yet then I cant recommend enough you go out and watch it as soon as you can A true classicpositive,The movie is one of my favorite movie. It was unfortunate that I didnt see it in the big screenpositive,The movie is all what i expect and imagine from the book excellent effects actors direction photography is amazing..the music... i have no words... The movie has a amazing develop from the first movie so this is the most involving but the end although the length is ... well.. From USA today: The three-part story of courage friendship honor and duty Š—” spanning The Fellowship of the Ring 2001 The Two Towers 2002 and The Return of the King which comes to theaters tonight Š—” is ideally suited to epic film-making. It is steeped in fast-paced action and grand adventure yet still grounded in humanity Š—” a rare combination among large-scale film extravaganzas. It isnt until now that director Peter Jacksons efforts can be fully and fairly judged notwithstanding the monumental box office success of the first two films which have grossed $1.8 billion worldwide. As good as each individual movie is the third film vaults the work into the stratosphere of classic movies. Key characters are enhanced new civilizations visited and battles fought more intensely while feelings and motivations are plumbed more deeply and movingly. After the release of the first and second films one wondered how the trilogy as a nine-hour film fest might compare with other cinematic watermarks. In its entirety The Lord of the Rings surpasses other multi-part sagas such as Star Wars or even The Godfather. Both Star Wars and The Godfather had weak links whole movies that didnt work as well as the best of the series. Rings maintains the same standard of excellence with each film and grows more assured with each installment. Of course some of that escalating power is attributable to the storytelling prowess of J.R.R. Tolkien upon whose classic novels the trilogy is based. The books depict the odyssey of the humble hobbit Frodo whose quest is to destroy a powerful ring that could enslave all the inhabitants of the fictional land of Middle-earth. Helping him accomplish his mission is a heroic cadre of creatures: Gandalf the wizardpositive,The movie is absolutely perfect. Outstandingly acted and perfectly directed by Chris Nolan. The movies only wrong is the fact that the character of Harvey Dent/Two Face isnt given enough time to develop his psychological state. Heath Ledger steals the show and stands out as the best actor in the bunch. The movie gets better and better every time I watch it. It not only surpasses Batman Begins - previously considered the high-water mark of movies about the Dark Knight - but one that magnificently transcends the superhero genre. Even if this wasnt Ledgers final role before his untimely death last year his Joker would still go down in cinema history as one of the most creepily unhinged big-screen bad guys of all time. LETS PUT A SMILE ON THAT FACE.positive,The movie is about the fall of two heroes - Gothams unofficial hero and Gothams real hero. Im talking about The Dark Knight and Harvey Dent. This amazing movie shows how easy its to fall to the dark side what Harvey Dent did. Aaron Eckhart is great in this role and Heath Ledger really shows what acting is.I really love Heath Ledger for his portrayal of the joker his best role. But unfortunately he past away and he got a Oscar post-Morten. The question if he really deserved the Academy Award is hard to answer he had a lot of really amazing competitors. Im afraid to say too much in this review so my best tip is to buy it on Blu-Ray or DVD and watch it I promise you youll love it.positive,the movie gone girl is about a man named nick dunne whose wife amy is missing on their fifth wedding anniversary then a while later they suspect that nick dunne killed his wife the movie is excellent and oscar worthy especially for rosamund pike and david fincher the movie is the best thriller of all time in my opinion it grabs your attention thanks to screenwriter and author gilliam flynn the movie has a great cast with a brilliant story that is suspenseful the theme of the movie is dark and creepy to intense more people throughout the movie this movie should be number 1 of the top 250 movies of all time it at least needs to get to 9510positive,The movie experience of the decade for me comes via PULP FICTION When it opened on opening day to little fanfare or hype I asked my friends if theyd want to go None did So I went by myself and had the most spiritual film experience of my life thus far Im 24 Electric Sharp Masterfully crafted and an incredible screenplay only tap the beginning as to how I feel about this masterpiece PULP FICTION is Why God Created Filmpositive,The movie begins with Batman and Lt. Jim Gordon closing in on the organized crime groups and leaders. In Gotham the gangs are united because of the presence of Batman. He put tracers on the money of the gangs to see its flow so that it will be easier to catch the leaders. These gangs have a Chinese national as their accountant and money launderer. He takes all of their money out of the banks to keep the money safe before the police get it. This plan works well because the police went to the banks and the money was gone. Their accountant Lou also left the country to avoid any charges against him. Then the Joker crashes the gangs meeting offering to kill Batman for half of their money. All the leaders said that the Joker was ridiculous but once batman brought Lou from China to the police the leaders gave the Joker access to all the man and utilities. The Joker wages war against Batman by trying to lure out the man under the mask by killing innocent people. The Batman was ready to come out in a conference when suddenly the new District Attorney Harvey Dent said he was batman. The Joker then tried to kill Dent but the Batman hid him. In the aftermath the Joker took Dents girlfriend Rachel who happens to be Batmans ex-girlfriend and threw her out a window. This exposed the Batmans weakness for Rachel because he jumped out after her. The Joker then takes Dent and Rachel and on opposite sides of the city and puts them in a room full of explosive with enough time for Batman to save one. The Batman decides to go after Dent who burns half of his face in the explosion which means Rachel died. Dent was furious with the Batman and started to hate the world. The Joker paid him a visit in the hospital and convinced him to blame the world. The Batman captures the Joker and is called to assist Lt. Gordon in saving his family from Harvey Dent. While saving the son of Gordon Batman kills Dent. He decides to take all the blame on himself to keep hope in the city. The Joker makes The Dark Knight a must watch film because he becomes the greatest villain of all time. Joker is a great super villain because he has no motive for his actions. In the opening scene you can see that the Joker is a mastermind. He plans a bank robbery second by second and in this job he kills all of the robbers that he hired to be left with all the money. Some argue that this is contradictory later in the movie where he burns money to show he does not care about the money. In reality the Joker planned this job to show the police that there is a new villain in Gotham. The joker wants batman to kill him knowing that the batman will not kill because justice will not be done. The Joker draws focus on the batman throughout the movie but in the end the unpredicted happens. The Joker shows Batman that his plan was to turn Dent the notorious new District Attorney being praised as the White Knight into a villain. The Joker does not want fame money or revenge. He simply wants to show the world that all people have their dark side but they chose to be good. The Joker knows exactly what to say to trigger people to react in a fit of rage and he knows exactly how to react in that situation. A villain should be terrifying in every scene and the Joker is a prime example of this. When he walks in on all of the gangs leaders meeting and is approached with opposition he opens his jacket to reveal about 6 grenades wired. He does not care about his life let alone anybody others. One of the most memorable qualities about the Joker is his scars. In the movie we never learn how he actually received them. Every time he brings up the scars the reasoning changes to apply to the person but later he ends up scarring the people to match him. Heath Ledger picked up a habit of flicking his tongue while trying to figure out the best was to portray the Joker and the little tongue flip in between the sentences make him seem creepier and builds suspense. At one scene the Joker is in the middle of the road crippled with the batman speeding violently straight at the Joker. The Jokers reaction is surprising instead of trying to avoid the Batman he stands and is calling for Batman to kill him. I can picture that scene now the Joker chanting and later screaming Come on. Come on. I want you to do it. Come on Hit me Hit me That scene shows that the Joker is fearless which in return makes him unpredictable and suspenseful. A villain that is asking for death knowing that if batman kills him that batman will become a vigilante. In conclusion the Joker is successful in flipping the one time unstoppable incorruptible district attorney Harvey Dent into a villain. This causes Batman to choose to let all of the peoples hopes and dreams of a brighter future die with Dent or should the story be flipped turning the Batman into the cities most hated man. The Jokers success in making the Batman have to go into hiding means that he accomplished what he wanted which makes him the greatest villain. Heath Ledgers role as the Joker won 32 Best Supporting Character awards. Ledgers acting and presentation of the Joker is unmatched. The Joker became the greatest villain of all time in The Dark Knight.positive,The most fantastic movie Ive seen its going to be considered classic even 100yrs from now A must watch cult movie that can teach actors and filmmakers the real way to make great art I have watched this movie tons of times and each time i watch it i get more in depth of what things actually meant Also Reservoir of Dogs is very recommended One of my most favorite movies of all I am a big fan of filmmaking in general and its very important to watch classics to really put yourself in the mind of the filmmakers at the times when action and horror movies hasnt yet trashed Hollywood Have Fun watching and Happy Journeypositive,the most amazing thing about this movie is its pioneering spirit they look at night sky and see a map of foreign worlds that need to be visited the movie presents lot of mysteries of the world in visually fascinating way those robots there are amazing as well complete opposite of marvin from hitchhikers guide to the galaxy i love them the emotional layer is as great as it gets you may very well find yourself crying possibly more than once finally the imagination was mind blowing rolling around the edges of the things you are yet willing to accept as possible it all feels very real like you are right there travelling across the universe encountering strangest parts of physicspositive,The more times you watch it the more you love it and the more you learn from it. An absolutely encouraging story to those who are desperate or sad or complaining about bad luck. If you never give up and try to figure out a way ahead nothing can stop you to the brightness and freedom. Everything you have experienced will bring you positive influences if you take it positively. I have watched it for many times at least ten times I guess. Now I hope I can download it and keep it and enjoy it once I have time. I used it to encourage people around me for example a girl friend whos suffering from the depression a workmate who has just lost his favorite pet and a friend who lost his job recently.positive,The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King was an amazing third part of The Lord of the Rings trilogy. It was good to show the prologue on how Smeagol/Gollum got the Ring. So it was shown that he murdered his own cousin Deagol. Through this we can all understand on how Gollum exactly got the Ring. If it hadnt for the prologue we could have just thought that Gollum got it by himself. But no what happened was Deagol got it first and stolen by Smeagol by killing Deagol. The effects made in The Three Hunters visit to the Dimholt road where the ghosts who will answer to the King of Gondor is found is wonderful. It was never seen clearly as digitally edited but more life-like. In the Battle of Pelennor Fields it was an amazing scene where thousands of orcs were made through Massive a software intended to create multiples of characters. The ROHAN scenery was great Theoden s screenplay during that time was most impressively appropriate for their situation. Eowyn also even as a woman acted great by Miranda Otto in taking down the Oliphaunt. I really loved her style. In the part where Legolas was told by Aragorn to take down the Oliphaunt. I love how Legolas acted by Orlando Bloom in that scene. I do not know whether it was digitally edited of his jumping or it was his own stunt. But however it was done it was amazing and stylish In the front of the Black Gate scene I have seen the extended edition of ROTK and the Mouth of Sauron was exclusively shown. I could have wanted it to be part of the movie but I understand that the movie is rate PG-13 and is needed not to show to much brutality. The part where Sam was going to help Frodo out I understood that the Ring was still tempting Frodo. Have any of you realized that the Ring didnt break out easily It was because it wanted Frodo to come after it and save it. But Frodo realized to climb up with the help of Sam and that was the time that the Ring broke because it knew that it will be destroyed once Frodo turns his back on it. I love how they interpreted the Rings desire into the movie though some may not see it that way. The part where Frodo was going to leave for Valinor I was sad that part. I even thought to myself Why would Frodo go but when he said to Sam We set out to save the Shire Sam and it has been saved but not for me. So I realized that Frodo as a hero did it not for himself but for his beloved home. The movie was incredibly awesomely greatly amazingly wonderfully beautifully made The crew and cast really made Tolkiens work come to life GO LOTR: ROTKpositive,The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King is the concluding chapter in the Lord of the Rings Trilogy and i must say it concluded amazingly. The movie starts off with a dark backstory of Smeagol which when I say dark I mean dark. You see Smeagol murder his friend Deagol or lover in which you realise how quickly the ring will poison mens minds - even to the point where one would murder a friend to have it. From here you see Smeagol deteriorate and become what we know as Gollum and its just a really dark segment but it provides a necessary backstory to the character. I must mention that there is one character in this movie that I despise of more than any character i have seen in any movie: Denethor Boromirs father who pretty much scorns his second born son Faramir. Its obvious that Faramir has been trying to prove his worthiness to his father for some time but when Denethor says to his son that he had wished he had died instead of Boromir you cant as the viewer help but feel as broken-hearted as Faramir. I mean imagine your father said that to you  So Gandalf took Pippin and rode to Minas Tirith. Meanwhile on the road to the ships that will take elves away from Middle Earth Arwen was thinking over her choice of path. Until has a vision of her son that convince her to go home. So she rode home and plead her father to reforge the ancient blade of Narsil and give it to her beloved Aragorn so he can become the king he was born to be. So overall ALL three films are excellent. And you know I do feel sorry for Faramir being an the unappreciated son I mean it was his big brother Boromir who was their dads favorite. I love the developing friendship between Merry & Eowyn. And I love the end-title song performed by Annie Lennox. positive,The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King in my view has to be one of the best if not THE bestconclusions to any trilogy in movie making history. When I first heard that Peter Jackson had begun filming the LOTR films I was a little apprehensive as Id not long finished reading the books. I thought there was no way hed be able to do them justice and that the films would go the same way as many trilogys had gone before by starting on a high but sadly lacking at the end. My apprehension however was not needed. The return of the king stayed more or less quite true to the books. The size and scale of the battles is immense and the sets scenery and CGIs are thoroughly stunning.I cant wait until the extended version comes out on DVD so as to see the bits that had to be omitted due to time constraints. Peter Jackson can now sit among the big boys of direction and I only hope that if he gets the go ahead for the Hobbit it will be made in the same style and panache as the LOTR trilogy. I would recommend Lord of the rings: return of the king to anyonepositive,The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King concludes the journey of Frodo Sam and Gollum to the fires of Mordor. But while they proceed to Mordor Gollum has a nasty plan to get back at Frodo for supposedly betraying him. And while this is happening Pippin Merry Gandalf Aragorn Legolas Gimli and the rest of the kingdom of Rohan learn of Saurons plan: To attack the kingdom of Gondor for he knows that the heir of Isildur Aragorn has come back. So begins one of the biggest battles you will see on the screen. I must say this is a great way to end the series. Yes its over 3 hours long but its still very good. And this is a film not a movie. A film. There is also much more emotion than in the other ones and you see the deterioration of Frodo as the ring takes hold of him. Please see this movie because if you think you thought that the first two were damn good you aint seen nothing yet.positive,The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King brings Peter Jacksons mammoth adaptation of J.R.R. Tolkiens classic to a close in suitably epic fashion. epic fantasy-drama film directed by Peter Jackson that is based on the second and third volumes of J. R. R. Tolkiens The Lord of the Rings. It is the concluding film in The Lord of the Rings film trilogy following The Fellowship of the Ring and The Two Towers. As Sauron launches the final stages of his conquest of Middle-earth Gandalf the Wizard and Th’©oden King of Rohan rally their forces to help defend Gondors capital Minas Tirith from the looming threat. Aragorn finally claims the throne of Gondor and summons an army of ghosts to help him defeat Sauron. Ultimately even with full strength of arms they realise they cannot winpositive,The Lord of the Rings: Return of the King is the third and final installment of Peter Jacksons adaptations of Tolkiens famous fantasy novels. Once again the makers of the film have taken care with the costumes sets scenery models CGI effects and Howard Shores epic  to create a convincing depiction of Middle Earth. Once again the cast delivers expert performances. John Noble joins the cast as Denethor and effectively makes him into a despicable and repugnant character. Three of the performances in the film were particularly memorable for me. Bernard Hill once again brings authority to the role of King Theoden and his inspiring presence on the battlefield left me in awe. Miranda Otto brings strength to the role of Eowyn and makes the characters best moments unforgettable. Ian McKellen once again brought his commanding presence as Gandalf to bear as he tried desperately to hold everything together. This film follows the familiar format of the first two films in taking Tolkiens work and streamlining it to create a well-paced film. The famous battle at Minas Tirith is on an unprecedented scale and the best fantasy battle ever filmed. As with the first two films I found the added scenes for the extended addition interesting but they didnt add much above and beyond the already great theatre cut.positive,The Lord of the Rings: Return of the king is a striking powerful and beautiful film with an amazing storyline. This is the final journey for the Fellowship of the ring to complete their mission through battle passion and love. I believe in this film this is where the true relationships of the characters start to form and become strong and meaningful. Without spoiling the film for you I will now talk about the soundtrack. For me the soundtrack is at the heart of this film. It is filled with so much emotion I even get teary when listening to it. A brilliant soundtrack along with an amazing story means you get an excellent film. I definitely recommend everyone to watch this although this film requires full concentration so perhaps only watch it when you have time to get the best experience.positive,The Lord of the Rings was a unique film made by a director and cast that were in tune with the book from which it was taken. It has been a privilege to see all the 3 movies almost impeccably true to the spirit of the book. It is with great anticipation that I look forward to the Hobbit to be made in New Zealand and know that sir Ian Mckellan is looking forward to spending a year there reprising his role as Gandalfhe has just said so - 20 minutes ago on BBC news. Im sure it will be made with the same dedication to detail that marked the sequel LOTR.It will be made more enjoyable now I have a large screen with which to view the spectacular scenery of New Zealand once again.positive,The Lord of the Rings trilogy made by Peter Jackson is easily one of the best fantasy flicks ever made. Not only the visual aspect of those three movies surpasses any single fantasy movie to be released before this film but also the story was magical captivating and unforgettable with great characters excellent performances and beautiful music. This was one of the most incredible films ever made I think those three Lord of the Rings flicks are the greatest achievement in all the history of cinema and the only movie to be almost as good as those movies was Avatar from James Cameron. The Return of the King is the excellent third and lastpart of this great trilogy and shares all the good elements of the two previous film. This movie was excellent from beginning to end being epic emotional and thrilling. The battle scenes were memorable and magnificent: The ending was perfect and closes in a satisfying way one of the greatest movie franchises ever made. This movie is magnificent and it is one of the best flicks ever made.positive,The Lord of the Rings trilogy are the three greatest films ever madepositive,The Lord of the Rings the Return of the King is an outstanding movie full of everything you could ever ask to be in a movie. There is romance between Sam and Rosie and Aragorn and Arwen who almost could not be together because of the war and Faramir and Eowyn. There is loads of comedy specifically speaking of Merry and Pippin but also between Gimli and Legolas when in the fight scenes. My favorite quote of Gimlis is always: Certainty of death small chance of success what are we waiting for i can not help but include a small giggle no matter what mood i am in. Another scene is when Legolas just takes on the giant elephaunt with many men in his way and Gimli still manages to keep that as one: That still only counts as one This movie is of course action packed. Thousands of blood-thirsty orcs completely built for killing march to the gates of Minas Tirith. after a few blows from the Gondor catapults throwing chunks of the city the massive army breaks into the city destroying everything in their path. just as all hope fails Aragorn Gimli and Legolas come to the rescue. Of course they couldnt do it alone the three heroes come to the rescue with a massive army behind them. what kind of army you may ask A dead army. the deadly army of the dead joined forces with Aragorn to assure their own freedom. The true meaning of the movie however is friendship. in the darkest times of Middle Earth 2 hobbits had what everyone in the world could have. each other or their own friendship. it seems as though the only hope in the world which they were lied with these two hobbits who berally knew how to wield a sword. carrying the one ring and each other Frodo Baggins and Sam Gamgee finally save Middle Earth and rid the world of its evil inhabitants just by keeping hope in front of them and holding on to each other. basically their faith in each other and their friendship saved all of Middle Earth. I hope that you enjoy this movie as much as i did.positive,The Lord of the Rings is without doubt the most epic and staggering film undertaking of all time. How Peter Jackson pulled it off I will never know maybe he used one of Gandalfs enchantments Rarely throughout the 12 hour epic is there a bad scene or a dull moment every scene has had so much thought and hard work poured into it. From the writing to the production crew to the acting to the sceneryto the music oh god I love the musicand just everybodys determination to pull this near impossible feat off even fantasy haters would have to admit their amazement. Never has a movie given me so many spine tingly moments and scenes of such beauty that they nearly push me to tears. Peter Jackson seemed so blessed with good fortune Viggo Mortensens last minute replacement says it all it was as if the spirit of Tolkien himself was guiding it along. As I see this as one whole movie I wont be reviewing just The Return of the King. I saw the first film The Fellowhip of the Ring when I was 12 and Im 21 now and I still havent been more absorbed by a movie in the cinema and I doubt I ever will. The transition from the innocence and lightness of the Shire at the start to the dark epic of the quest later is nothing short of brilliant. I think Fellowship is my favourite of the three it goes through the most development and felt the most satisfying. The whole mines of Moria sequence is my standout moment of the entire trilogy. To the battle with the cave troll and the escape from the balrog it is exhilarating involving and most of all - emotional. The Two Towers has the hardest task of being the middle film but it more than rises to the challenge. It drops you straight into the action and doesnt hold up. The Rohan sequences are the best bits of the film culminating in the battle of helms deep which to me is the most personal and intense battle of the trilogy. The creation of Gollum was revolutionary through CGI and motion capture never has a computerised character seemed so real. The Return of the King delivers the emotional finale we all hoped it would. I remember sitting in the cinema hearing all sorts of sobbing all around me during the climax on mount doom. There are so many stand-out moments in this movie but the one I will mention is the charge of the Rohirrim. This scene actually pushed me to tears on first viewing not because it was sad but because it was so... awesome. I was so happy when this film won 11 Oscars it more than deserved it I was hoping it would win more than 11 but oh well. Any gripes I have for the trilogy would be the portrayal of its big bad Sauron and considering that Sauron is the centre of The Lord of the Rings this is definitely a problem. If there was one thing from the books that is unfilmable it is definitely Sauron. How do you portray a villain that hardly appears and any descriptions of him there are are so vague and surreal Is Sauron a big flaming eye or did he have a physical form This is never made clear in the books and poses a big obstacle for film where the audience needs to see their villain. Peter Jackson and co do the best they can with the material and chose to literally portray Sauron as the big flaming eye. However this is not enough to satisfy especially during the climax of Return of the King where the dark lord is basically a lighthouse The films make the mistake of bigging Sauron up through the films and ultimately it fizzles out by the end which is a real shame. As you can tell from what I have said I love The Lord of the Rings and I would say it is my favourite film of all time. No other film has moved me as much as this and given me so many different emotions from fear to sadness to laughter. I honestly couldnt imagine anyone else playing the characters it was if they were made for them. The actors all generally had a special relationship with one another and with Peter Jackson just watch the extras and that what you are watching on screen is genuine. It was almost to the point that the actors werent working so hard out of professionalism but out of love and devotion to Mr.Jackson. Hardly any other films can claim they had this kind of magic behind the camera. Honourable mentions will be given to Ian Mckellen as Gandalf Viggo Mortensen as Aragorn and Elijah Wood as Frodo I felt these three literally became the characters they were playing but of course there are countless others to mention but I dont have time. Howard Shores  is possibly the best movie  ever and the films would be nothing without it. Ultimately say what you will hardcore Tolkien fans about the films you cannot deny that they did so much for Tolkiens greatest work and made it one of the most recognisable stories in the world. If you have somehow not seen these films first of all slap yourself and secondly go buy the extended editions as these are the true versions of the films and include many great scenes that were cut - especially The Return of the King which had many vital scenes cut aka. Sarumans last hoorah and Gandalf confronting the Witch King. Peter Jackson I salute you and New Zealandpositive,The Lord of the Rings is an epic high fantasy novel written by English philologist and University of Oxford professor J. R. R. Tolkien. The story began as a sequel to Tolkiens 1937 childrens fantasy novel The Hobbit but eventually developed into a much larger work. It was written in stages between 1937 and 1949 much of it during World War II. It is the second best-selling novel ever written with over 150 million copies sold. The title of the novel refers to the storys main antagonist the Dark Lord Sauronwho had in an earlier age created the One Ring to rule the other Rings of Power as the ultimate weapon in his campaign to conquer and rule all of Middle-earth. From quiet beginnings in the Shire a Hobbit land not unlike the English countryside the story ranges across northwest Middle-earth following the course of the War of the Ring through the eyes of its characters the hobbits Frodo Baggins Samwise Sam Gamgee Meriadoc Merry Brandybuck and Peregrin Pippin Took but also the hobbits chief allies and traveling companions: the Men Aragorn a Ranger of the North and Boromir a Captain of Gondorpositive,The Lord of the Rings is an amazingly powerful visual experience. Not even just a visual experience. Peter Jackson has crafted one of the finest written pieces of our era into THE quintessential epic. He supplements the brilliant storytelling of JRR Tolkien with one of the most awe-inspiring collection of films ever created t is one of the masterpieces delivered by the legendary director Peter Jackson.The film takes us to the final part of the journey of the hobbit Master Frodo baggins and his friend samwise gamgee to the rough and dry evil land of mordor to the mount doom to destroy the ring made by the evil lord Sauron.This movie completely grasps you and amazes you alongwith inspiring you and giving a simple yet important message that with courage you can achieve anything as was done by Frodo and thus disproving the phrase Nobody simply walks into Mordor.Legendary actor Sir Ian mckellen completely justified the with the role of gandalf.Elijah wood as Frodo baggins and Viggo Mortensen as Aragorn has delivered the performances of their lives. As a film though this is amazing. A true lasting legacy in story telling and now cinemapositive,The lord of the rings ... Best trilogy and movie ever made. The cast as they have been all the way are excellent. Woods Frodo changes well during this film while Astin is touching in his portrayal of unerring friendship. Bloom and Rhys-Davis had less to do but came into their own during the battle scenes - adding both action and the odd comic touch that still counts as one being accepted by the audience as a chance to break the tension. Mortensen is the title character and serves it well with McKellen also continuing his strong role. I could list through the whole cast but I will stick with noting two things. Firstly both Monaghan and Boyd had bigger and more meaningful roles and rose to them well. Secondly I continue with my belief from the second film that Serkis is the stand out actor of the trilogy. His Gollum is so much more than an effect - he is tragic fearsome hateful and funny. Praise of course goes to the special effects for making this character tell so much with an expression but to pretend that the work of the actor is secondary to the character as opposed the look is foolish. He deserved one for Two Towers so I hope an Oscar goes his way. It was a shame to not have screen time for Lee but the film works well without him and it was a brave move by the editors.positive,The Lord of the Rings - The Two Towers is truly an amazing film and the middle part of the sweeping Lord of the Rings saga of films by Peter Jackson. It is obviously very highly rated and critically acclaimed but for whatever reason it is not as loved as the first and third parts of the Lord of the Rings franchise. The first part obviously sets everything up and begins the journey and part three is all about the climax and resolution with some obviously really huge stuff going on but part two has just as much action. Id rank them: Part 3 then Part 2 then Part 1 in order of enjoyment and how much action there was in each film. My only downside for part two is that it ends kind of abruptly in a weird place it would have been better to have the story go a bit longer in part two instead of saving the spider etc and so much more for part three.positive,The longest movie ever made so long that the director had to divide it in three parts and thats why people call a trilogy. 10 hours of a phenomenal spectacle that will leave anyone with tears and a heavy heart after the magnificent end. In The Fellowship of the Ring we start with the journey of Frodo Elijah Wood and Sam Sean Astin towards to Mordor lair of the dark lord Sauron. And we see the great training and union of the Fellowship of the ring an alliance of all the living beings of Middle-earth on a mission to destroy the One Ring and thus save the world from the darkness. In Two Towers we have the beginning of the Great War between humans and orcs with the army of Saruman Christopher Lee marching against the kingdom of Rohan. And Aragorn Viggo Mortensen along with the elf Legolas Orlando Bloom and the dwarf Gimli John Rhys-Davies joining in the battle. Meanwhile Frodo and Sam are getting closer every day to the lair of Sauron now having the help of the strange creature Gollum / Smeagol Andy Serkis who wants by all means his precious. And finally in The Return of the King we have the spectacular ending to the trilogy / film. Since the beginning of the film we felt the feeling that everything is coming to an end. Frodo and Sam finally reached Mordor and try to find a way to infiltrate into the enemy territory and Gollum / Smeagol plans to take the ring from Frodo who becomes increasingly heavy. And on the other side we have the beginning of the great battle that we expected since the first movie the showdown between humans and orcs in the battle that will determine the fate of the world with all the characters we have learned to love here together in this fight to the uncertain ending. Peter Jackson director-writer brought to life the masterpiece of books Lord of the Rings by the genius JRR Tolkien. This can be the best adaptation of a book to film ever made if the book is already a masterpiece in the world of books Jackson made a masterpiece of cinema. The gigantic story that was told in six books in film it was told in one film. A film of more than 10 hours it had to be divided into three parts forming the best trilogy already made. I say its just a movie because all three movies work as one from the beginning to the end we realize that. Since the first film or first part we have the magic of Tolkiens working here along with Jackson Fran Walsh and Philippa Boyens writers have recreated and remained faithful to Tolkiens work and the film managed to raise the themes of friendship courage and while it has always had religious references in the book and the film manages to convey everything in the greatest perfection. Not only the writing is phenomenal but the visual effects are stunning giving a gigantic scale the movie so well detailed visual effects that make everything look so realistic. And the effects are not only stunning but also that the soundtrack that is simply magnificent. A trilogy that works as a single film that is a true masterpiece. A landmark in film history thanks to excellent writing and direction of Jackson and fantastic performances from all the cast The Lord of the Rings is the epic fantasy stunning in every detail and be loved by all. 10/10positive,The lives of two mob hit men a boxer a gangsters wife and a pair of diner bandits intertwine in four tales of violence and redemption Pulp Fiction is known for its high praise highly praised as one of the best movies of all time Funny thing is: the movie is pointless and it has no message This is where it all falls in place The acting is top notch  everybody did an excellent job with their individual flair of black comedy The style was very familiar if you have seen Quentins earlier work I found this movie to be completely awesome something missing from movies nowadays Movies nowadays include a message but do not execute it the right way Pulp Fiction though has NO message and executes it nicely Its fun its gritty and its just over-the-top greatness This is what I wanna expect from movies but sadly nothing can have that feeling you get when you finish Pulp Fiction These facts combine to the fact that Pulp Fiction is one of my favorite films It has no point  but the fact that is HAS no point puts it up there with the greatest I had no expectations beforehand but afterword I had so much to praise The entertainment the humor and the point Lying before YES it has a point But it is too obscured to find out the real meaning I love this movie and Im sure you will too Dont walk in with expectations  itll ruin the surprise The surprise is the joy and fun youll get with the film Pulp Fiction includes great acting great fun and overall great entertainment This is by far Quentins best film 10/10  positive,The last part of the lord of the rings trilogy was even better than the excellent two first movies. Positive:fantastic actionemotional depththe feeling of closureloyal to the bookexcellent CGI Negative-nothing This movie is in my considerate opinion one of the best movies I have ever seen and concludes a brilliantamazing-awesome trilogy.congratulations to Persy Jackson and all the cast.well deserved the Oscars.best movie 2003.no doubt about that.I think that Tolkien would be proud. Gandalf and Aragorn lead the World of Men against Saurons army to draw his gaze from Frodo and Sam as they approach Mount Doom with the One Ring.positive,The Joker is the main attraction of this movie. This character was simply brilliant. Everything went according to plan and this is one of the most faultless characters you will ever see. Before Ledger was confirmed to play the Joker in July 2006 Paul BettanyLachy HulmeAdrien BrodySteve Carelland Robin Williams expressed their interest in the role. However Nolan preferred Ledger for his chaotic interpretation of the character. Ledger was also interested in doing a film having high expectation. He described his Joker as a psychopathic mass murdering schizophrenic clown with zero empathy. Throughout the film the Joker states his desire to upset social order through crime and comes to define himself by his conflict with Batman. To prepare for the role Ledger lived alone in a hotel room for a month formulating the characters posture voice and personality and kept a diary in which he recorded the Jokers thoughts and feelings. Ledger eventually generated a voice unlike Jack Nicholsons character in Tim Burtons 1989 Batman film. Theres a bit of everything in him. Theres nothing that consistent Ledger said. Ledger was allowed to shoot and mostly direct the videos the Joker sends out as warnings. Each take Ledger made was different from the last. Nolan was impressed enough with the first video shoot. Ledgers acting was so lively that most people will agree that this is the best villain character ever. Even when it comes to the best acting performance of all time Joker should be in the top three. His character was so touching and enthusiastic that people will want to be the Joker rather than becoming Batman if they have a choice. This character had a deep impact in viewers mind. On January 22 2008 after he had completed filming The Dark Knight Ledger died of an accidental prescription drug overdose leading to intense press attention and memorial tributes. It was tremendously emotional right when he passed having to go back in and look at him every day Nolan recalled. But the truth is I feel very lucky to have something productive to do to have a performance that he was very very proud of and that he had entrusted to me to finish. All of Ledgers scenes appear as he completed them in the filmingpositive,The Joker clowns makeup more sloppy than before his cackle betraying deep wounds he seeks revenge he claims for the horrible punishment his father exacted on him when he was a child. In one diabolical scheme near the end of the film he invites two ferry-loads of passengers to blow up the other before they are blown up themselves. Throughout the film he devises ingenious situations that force Batman Commissioner Gordon and District Attorney Harvey Dent to make impossible ethical decisions. By the end the whole moral foundation of the Batman legend is threatenedpositive,The intelligent cut from the editor Sally Menke working with the master Quentin Tarantino has just made a movie worth watching over and over to enjoy each particular scene a tribute to everyone who likes movies and good music a puzzle just possible to be done by watching more than once in order to memorize those amazing quotes quotes like I do believe Marsellus Wallace my husband your boss told you to take me out and do whatever I wanted. Now I want to dance I want to win. I want that trophy so dance good. A scene that makes us travel in time to gold Ed Sullivans time or to Grease great lines that just Tarantinos at his best could deliver tomato joke hamburgers 5 dollar shake watch hidden in the ass sword and memorable characters surely my top 10 best movies ever made.positive,The hobbits approach the slopes of Mount Doom preparing to dispose of the cursed Ring while the forces of good and evil are rallied in anticipation of the ultimate battle. The film won the Academy Award for Best Picture the only time in history a fantasy film has done so. The Return Of The King is the longest of the three films which suffers from having to cut between disparate story strands and - in its final half-hour - stacks up endings one after the other like jet planes waiting to land the director visibly reluctant to let these characters go. Most audiences will forgive Peter Jackson for that for this is a fitting conclusion to a series of films made with tremendous artistry and affection for their subjectpositive,The hobbit movies are better. But it is still all the middle earth movies are good. This movie as a great story line. It is one of the scariest movie made before 2012. It has great acting. Great special effects. Great visual effects. Great movie See it. It has a lot of action. It is long but so fast past that you will not notes. You could watch the first 2 movies first and you still wont notes the time going by. This is a great movie. One of the beast fantasy movie ever made. It is so cool. See all the middle earth movies they are awesome. Great movie great movie great movie great movie. See it see it see it see it see it see it see it. Some of scariest movie monsters are in this film.positive,The highlight of this film is one man and one man only...the Late Heath Ledger...his Oscar-worthy performance marks the best work in his short lifetime...and not only him but Christopher Nolan should also be commended in the way in which he developed the atmosphere of the filmpositive,The greatness of this film is in its excellent presentation and articulation of what lies deep within a human being that makes him/her persevere against impossible odds especially so when he/she is facing a terrible injustice. This reminds me of Viktor Frankls book Mans Search for Meaning based on his experiences in prison under far worse conditions than depicted in this film. It is only under the harshest and most extreme of circumstances that a sensitive and just human being whose integrity is under attack will almost certainly face the question of the meaning of his/her life and in general the meaning of life and the meaning of freedom. The only real freedom that human beings have lies in a creative response to the impossible but challenging circumstances that one faces and in that creative expression one finds meaning. No one can give that freedom and no one can take away that freedom Š—– its source is within and completely independent of external circumstances and institutions. All institutions tend to inhibit this freedom and instead confine individuals so that they become institutionalized. The prison is the toughest of all institutions. But the tougher the conditions the greater is the challenge and if understood that way the greater the rewards in finding meaning. But until that is accomplished one must have something essential and substantial to believe in Š—– call it hope or faith or self esteem Š—– in order to survive for nothing is accomplished in death. At the same time the idea of death itself is the motivating force Š—– a sense that one could die without having achieved anything in life is the most powerful life sustaining force itself Š—– this is the most stupendous paradox of human existence something that was hinted at in Joseph Hellers Catch 22. At the centre of this catch is the hope a word much abused that one will find meaning even in the most hopeless of conditions that one will be able to forge something good out of the entire BS that surrounds us. And that which is good lasts forever. That is the true faith not the false faith of the corrupt Warden who in this case is not only the proverbial devil who is fond of quoting from the scriptures but also gives the airs and appearances of one who is a man of God only because of his fanatical devotion to the Bible. The irony of it all is brought out superbly near the end. The ending was the best part in a way because this story was no hopelessly fated Greek Tragedy as the central message of the film was that hope within one man can light up the hope in another who otherwise would have given up and that this evocation is a very powerful bond between humans in this case between two very different kind of humans both by background as well as race but who become the best of friends because they share something vital deep inside that makes them to get busy living rather than to get busy dying. Finally what makes this one of the greatest movies is that it also has drama adventure and action which makes it appealing to a wide audience. For the serious it can revisited several times for the special kind of mood that it evokes Š—– a mood that is both uplifting as well as thought provoking.positive,The Greatest Movie of All Time everything was great. if you are a true batman fan you must watch. The whole trilogy are wonder full Just wish Christian Bale would come out in The Man of Steel sequel.People had doubts about Heath Ledger but i believe he nailed it. I always recommend this movie too people who havent seen it.I think Chris Nolan and Zack Snyder make a great team and should diffidently keep going for more hits. Possibly make a Justice League in The future Great storyline .... Just sad to Hear about Heath Ledger his performance we be remembered.If you like This Film i also recommend The Dark Knight Rises Tom Hardy also does a great performance. Great Job to allpositive,The greatest movie ever made.. Period. Pure and simple it is what every director hope to achieve. The film will keep you glued to your seat if you know what it means.It will bring tears to your eyes. It will make you think how you have lived your life so far...or in fact how you have wasted it. It will teach you the value of freedom which we enjoy without giving a second thought. And it will leave you with a sense of happiness which you will experience only rarely. The performances are simply mind boggling be it Tim Robbins or Morgan Freeman or countless others. And it is difficult to believe this was the debut of Frank Darabont as a director.If you havent already seen it... please do otherwise you are missing something.positive,The first time i saw this movie was at a friends house I was only 11 at the time and i never really understood the real content of the movie But as i grew older and matured i watched it over and over again and now that i know what it is all about i can appreciate it a little more The movie became my life I would watch it almost everyday and never get sick of it I would show it to my friends and anyone else who was interested in watching it I dont know why it took me like it did but there was just something about it A film filled with great one liners and sayings that would make you look at the world of crime a lot more differently Very offensive in more ways than one but if you can manage to look past the endless use of four letter words than you will probably like it If you havent seen Pulp Fiction than see it because you will miss the number one movie of all timepositive,The first time I saw this film I said those three words a lot to my friends and family. Shawshank Redemption is the BEST FILM I have ever seen in my lifetime. I have seen tons of films. Morgan Freeman gave a performance that will touch anyones heart. From beginning to end this film shows how films should be made.positive,The first thing that came to my mind when I left the theater was Oh man that movie was f#$@ awesome This movie is unbelievable. It is different from other superhero movies mostly because of its plot and the great dialogs but also the way the action scenes are presented. Nolan has done a very good job and there is no way you will get bored or tired of the endless action. However the one and only feature that makes this film special is the enemy. The Joker has become even more popular after The Dark Knight and became maybe the most likable villain. His goal isnt money or power he wants to see the Gotham destroyed and corrupt its people as more as he can. But what makes him unique is that instead of killing Batman which would make him reach his goal much easier he enjoys playing with him and torture him not physically but mentally. The awesomeness of this character completes with Heath Ledgers epic performance delivering the role of his lifetime. In my opinion this is by far the best superhero movie but also one of the best movies Ive ever seen. If you like superhero movies you will love it If you are not a big fun of this kind but you enjoy a good action movieŠ—_ you will love itpositive,the first reason for see this movie is angelina jolie but all in this movie is incredible dressing images music story visual effects a different story in this movie you found why maleficient go to the castle also you understand the roles of other characters the voice of angelina jolie is attractive but at the same time you feel fear about her most of us knew about this story when we were children but is fantastic watch this movie now in real action we could talk about this movie like feminist i watch this movie twice and i suggest all my family go to watch it sincerely i hope disney did this with all their classic moviepositive,The first gangster film to make inane yet paralyzing dialog the star of the movie Brilliant and engaging endlessly quotable and visually alluring PF made all the top lists regenerated John Travolta solidified Bruce Willis centered Samuel L Washington as a leading man and cemented Christopher Walken among creepiest of cameos ever The side characters are more accessible and reminiscent as friends of ours then they are as plot worthy points of interest They discuss everyday trivial matters intensely while the viewer is wondering about the ramifications of the events just watched or know is around the corner and we actually see very little violence play out Tarantinos use of the chopped up time line only added to the Pulp mystique as well as its charm Imbecile gangsters charming Regressive American social interaction cinema worthy When combined  it remains a perfect storm for Quintin & companypositive,The Final Chapter of this great trilogy will just rip your heart out of your ribs I dont know how Peter Jackson did itand perhaps sucha masterpiece such as this has the right not to be questioned. I loved the first movie its steady pace of adventure is non-stop the characters are loveable the costume is nice the settings are stupendous and the Visual effects is Jaw-Dropping. And I loved the second even better with the Battle of Helms Deep finally winning over my breaking heart with the Two LOTR Movies already gnawing at the bottom I had to say a final farewell to Star Wars 4 & 5 and welcome The LLord of the Rings. And with this my heart is fainally complete. The MArmaluks are unstoppable and Visually Great No words could describe the intensity of their presence alone. And the Battle of Pelanor Fields will get you to want to wish you were there yourself and not as an orc Though Trolls are Cool Though pales in comparisson with the Mass of Undead and of course the Oliphaunts. Gollum is once again as great as ever and The rest of the cast are comendable with great praises going to be due to Gandalf and most especially Sam The emotional intensity of the film is a full ten And after you cry from the movies story youll cry about why oh why wasnt it any longer And indeed we must now bid a final farewell to our dearest The Lord of The Rings Trilogy the only Trilogy to have a complete set of Movies with no equals but each other. Good bye........ sorry I just dont wanna leave it alone....positive,The film is very well directed and scripted yet the film also shows that Quentin Tarantino is far better a director than an actor

out f_lix tardieu november 1st 2014positive,The Fellowship makes its final path through war and wilderness. The story comes to an 11 academy award winning climax. The movie has a stunning power unlike the other two. Peter Jackson uses incredible insight into sstories and themes and character study. The Return of the King culminates its three story lines unimaginably. As the characters finish what is a three year journey you see exactly why Peter Jackson made the fellowship and the two towers because he wanted to arrive at this incredible finale to what is a career trilogy. I enjoyed this film for two main reasons action and intimacy. The action is stunningly realized by weta workshop. But even though the action is great at the center of it is what is a wonderfully intimate story. As Frodo and Sam make their way to Mount Doom we really get to see them both rise to the occasion. We see the real power of friendship as Gollum continues to try to break it. When Aragorn and Gandalf arrive at over 600.000 orcs and yet they stand as strong as they were at Helms Deep. I become more amazed as the tale goes on we see how difficult and at what price will either side win. The feelings of community within us. This is a classic and whoever watches will not be disappointed. 10/10positive,The fact that I can repeatedly sit through a film that is over 3.5 hours long and still be fully entertained is somewhat of a wonder to me. There are some movies that I cringe my way through or am so bored that I check the time and cant wait for it to be over but not the LOTR. This movie perfectly captures the world that Tolkien created by combining several flawless elements that work to make this one of the best movies ever made. The acting cast CGI wardrobe and general attention to the simplest of details are what makes this a truly magical movie. From the mountain of books in the background of Bilbos study to the rust and grime on the armor of the Orc berserkers its the painstaking attention to detail that makes this movie endlessly re-watchable and timelessly beautiful.positive,The epic conclusion to this outstanding story. I have never watched a series of films that have been made with utter perfection that as you stare at the end credits you are left in awe of the pure brilliance of Peter Jacksons work - reflecting on what you have experienced throughout the trilogy. The combined flawlessness of the the acting the script the filming the special effects and most importantly for me the music have made this film a rarity of unmatched excellence that sets the bar for all other films. An outstanding achievement in film making that should be seen by all. A 10/10 for this film along with the previous two.  violent but in a cool way. Shocking but in a cool way. I dont know how many times I have seen this film but I now see its so much more. Its a rich intertextual film going experience. Its a gangstar movie. For lack of a stronger term its a black comedy. Its a renegade boxer story. Its Easy Rider Deliverance and Shaft. Its a film noir its a melodrama. Its romance and action. Its narrative flow is not just novel but near genious. If Tarantino was only allowed to be credited with one film in his amazing career this would definitely be the one. positive,The entire Lord of the Rings saga deserves to be immortalized as such an epic incarnation of great fantasy. This whole trilogy was the reason why I became interested in the fantasy genre as a young adult. I remember seeing The Two Towers and The Return of the King when they were respectively being released in theaters. Both of the movies blew me away. They were unlike anything I had ever seen in my life. This was a driving force to me because now I wanted to read not only the Lord of the Rings and other Tolkien books but also the R. A. Salvatore and Dark Sun World books. This was such an influential movie to me and I hope that it is movies like this that are passed on to the next generation. Good acting epic battle scenes convincing dialogue well-done settings and an awesome story all comprise the entire LOTR trilogy. I say this as a die-hard fan of the fantasy genre first baptized by Lord of the Ringspositive,The ending to Lord of the Rings is not only great and powerful but it will become a movie that is remembered for ages. The actors portrayed the characters perfectlytheir performances are memorable and the story is unforgetable. This movie and its actors deserve a nods at the Oscars this year.positive,The Dark Night is amazing. I have seen it three times already and I am going to see it again. I didnt like Batman Begins. I thought that the action was to fast and it cut away to much. This film still does that but it is easier to tell what is going on. The acting is great. Christian Bale is the best batman yet.Every time I think of Alfred I now see Micheal Caine. The real star of the show is Heath Ledger as the Joker. He is creepy psychotic and funny in a very twisted way. 2 1/2 hours may seem long but it flies by. This is the best film I have seen so far this year.positive,The Dark Knight Was The Best Of The Christopher Nolan Trilogy Heath Ledgers Joker Is The Best His Raw Talent And Natural Feel For The Character Will Never Be Repeated The Talent Over All In The Series Was Out Of This World..Michael CainMorgan Freeman Christian Bale & Gary Oldman To Name A Few The Passion Of This Trilogy Really Comes Out In The Dark Knight Why So Serious & Do you want to know how i got these scars have become house hold quotes My love For Batman Became Stronger Cause Of These 3 Movies Everyone Should See Them Rent Them Buy Them But Watch Them They Are That Great I Recommend A Marathon Of All The Moviespositive,The Dark Knight was probably the best action film Ive ever seen. Not only is the design tone special FX sound and music all were excellentpositive,The Dark Knight was and still is nothing short of a masterpiece and a mind bending acting demonstration. The plot special effects acting choreography and the ability to entice a viewer into the movie itself puts it in its own category of genius. Heath Ledger is THE MOVIE. A perfect example of an actor who put on his best final performance never coming out of character and before you know itpositive,The Dark Knight was a marvelous film. It shows us what a city might be like with potentially unstoppable criminals and corrupt police officers. My favorite content that the movie had was showing us what can really happen. Corruption has taken over GPD and Gothem is becoming a horrible city. Some of the criminal tactics are just horrific. A world where the police have no power can scare the bejeezus out of anyone. The cast and soundtrack were also excellent. My favorites were Morgan FreemanLucky # Slevin and Aaron EckhartThe Black Dahlia. Christain Bale was also excellent in the film. The soundtracks were terrific. Hans ZimmerPearl Harbor Soundtrack made the movie come to life. Everyone knows that a movie is not a true movie without an excellent soundtrack and The Dark Knight truly proves that point. Imagine the movie Titanic without the music. It would not be as good. Same thing applies for any movie. The movie was an excellent action thriller. 10 out of 10 stars is not enoughpositive,The Dark Knight trilogy consists of three of my many all time favourite movies. Each movie is as good as each other. However when Christopher Nolan dropped the sequel surrounded with buzz and anticipationpositive,The Dark Knight tops Batman Begins enormously. The line-up feels so different but only a small part of the cast is new. If you thought the first was good then this is the ultimate superhero film. The fact is it doesnt even have the feel of a superhero flick. Yes you have the hero going around in a costume complete with a mask and cape and yes you have the villain disguised by something and wearing an iconic costume but if you actually look closer youll see the hero is a vigilante and youll see that his suit is very lethal and isnt a red and blue spandex outfit. And look closer at the villain and youll see he is absolutely crazy and insane but is also very very clever. The star of the film however isnt Bats. Its Heath Ledger as The Joker. His death a few months after the release of the film was tragic so he left the world with one of the greatest characters of 21st century cinema. He is the glue of the film. The storyline is very good without being too serious. A bit of humour is injected but at the right dose. See this film and you will be amazed.positive,The Dark Knight that came out in 2008 starring Christian Bale Heath Ledger Aaron Eckhart Michael Caine Gary Oldman Morgan Freeman and Maggie Gyllenhaal is a superhero movie of Batman. When Batman Gordon and Harvey Dent tries bring down the mob they face a new threat The Joker who raises hell in Gotham. What unfolds is a 150 min of high pace crime thriller. The story is quite dark complex and engaging. The cast is just amazing. Heath Ledger gave legendary outstanding performance in his last role. His each dialogue is just amazing. I kinda love every sec he is in on the screen. The Joker can be considered one of the best villains of all time. Christian Bale is amazing in his best role of Batman. Though not as screen time as he had in the last movie Batman Begins but still he gave an amazing performance. Aaron Eckhart as Harvey Dent was quite good. After Joker Harvey had 2nd best dialogues of the movie. Pacing of the movie is awesome too. There wont be any part of the movie which feels slow or boring mainly because every conversation is important. Action is kinda different and unique making it amazing . Overall The Dark knight is an OUTSTANDING movie. Plot:10/10 Dialogue:10/10 Acting:10/10 Action:10/10 Pace:10/10 Overall:10/10positive,The Dark Knight surpassed all my expectations. Visually the film is rich. It has that expensive big-budget look about it without it being too overwhelming. The action has been directed stylishly by Nolan again it looks astounding whilst at the same time being easy on the eye you wont find Michael Bays trademark shakey-cam in this film. The action is great yes but the smaller dramatic sequences are where this film raises the bar of the superhero genre a bar previously set by its predecessor Batman Begins. The entire cast suit their roles and play them with conviction. As expected the standout performance comes from Heath Ledger as the Joker - its an Oscar-worthy performance in my view - but the entire main castpositive,The dark knight rises is a masterpiece. Its a movie I can watch over and over. It keeps you on the edge of your seat the whole time. Heath ledgers role in this movie is excellent. He played the joker perfectly. The movie ends very well. Its a lengthy movie but it doesnt seem very long because it keeps you interested. I believe this movie should be ranked higher in the top 250 honestly. At least number 2. This movie doesnt overload you on any one element. Theres a perfect amount of action drama suspense and some comical aspects in there too. Nolan did an excellent job on this movie and the whole trilogy actually. This isnt one of those movies where you can predict the ending or how things will play out this is the joker. The joker being in this one just throws you all over the place without making it confusing surprising would be a good word for it. There is so many plot twists. All in all. Watch this movie if you havent already. Its awesomepositive,The Dark Knight not only pushes the boundaries to be a better super hero film it not only pushes the boundaries to be a better drama- it pushes the boundaries of masterpiece. It is a near-perfect depiction of how one man can really make a difference good or bad. This makes the film more compelling than the average action film. I will not go into detail about Heath Ledgers performance but in short it changed the industry. If you havent seen this film yet exit this page dont rent the movie BUY it and just watch it until you realize that you are seeing a film of class and quality and know that every second that goes by is worth it.  not a single minute could be considered a bad acting well at least I think so. Entertaining for it makes you enjoy the time spend on it and once finished there are no regrets. I am not a huge fan of Tim Robbins but the movie undoubtedly showed his talent. Mr. Freeman stays solid as usual in his act. positive,The Dark Knight maintained the intensity and overall gunmetal grayish feel that sets this Batman apart. The film takes us to a Gotham City that has grown accustomed to the big bats crime-fighting crusades and the last remaining big time criminals have actually grown fearful of his wrath. They form an alliance to attempt to keep their illicit business activities alive but are feeling even more pressure from yet a different angle: the passionate and fearless new district attorney Harvey Dent. Recognizing the crime groups looming extinction a stranger enters their circle and offers what he thinks is the only solution: kill Batman. The bad guys dont know if they can trust this seemingly demented madman and they later learn the hard way that they dont really have a choice for the most disturbing part of the Jokers personality is his motive. He doesnt care about money or power. He just enjoys causing trouble and watching with pleasure from the sidelines as the terrorized city scrambles in mayhem...which leads me to the real star of this film Heath Ledger. Ledgers performance as the Joker is astounding and consuming. We come face-to-face with a villain bearing the coldness of a psychopath and a personality that remains as mysterious and inexplicable as the real reason for the scars on his face. He develops the air of the lone offender quite early on as he nonchalantly kills those who help him commit his crimes. Yet he has no problem building an army of followers and the viewers easily find that believable. As insane as he is hes focused and quite determined. Ledger also brings the Jokers humor to the role but he does it in a way that is unique to this interpretation...with subtlety and honesty. The very words and mannerisms that made me laugh also evoked feelings of sadness in its clarity. The evil is incredibly convincing. Although Batman is a character that is often marketed towards kids this film is definitely not appropriate for young children. In addition to the dark images the violence both seen and implied is sometimes unsettling and Ledgers Joker is chilling even for adult viewers. Having said that this is by far one of the best films Ive ever seen and it will easily find a place in my personal top ten. I am only disappointed that this Joker the best villain in a film since Hannibal Lecter will never be revealed to us again.  along the way we also get to know and grow attached to the other prisoners trapped inside Shawshank. The movie flows perfectly from one scene to the next never feeling forced or losing your interest. The movie is mostly dialogue driven but there are some violent scenes which help convey the brutality of prison life. Finally the final 30 minutes are perhaps the most satisfying in any movie. I do not want to spoil the ending for those who have never seen it but suffice to say the final act of the movie leaves you floored. Both times that I saw it I was rooted to my seat long after the credits rolled just thinking about the brilliance of the ending and the entire movie as a whole. Forrest Gump and Pulp Fiction are both great movies highly entertaining. I particularly love Pulp Fiction  however it is a travesty that The Shawshank Redemption did not win Best Picture. It was certainly the best film of the year in my opinion arguably the best film of the decade and perhaps one of the finest movies ever made. The even bigger tragedy though is that while Morgan Freeman earned an Oscar nomination for his great performance Tim Robbins turn as Andy Dufresne went without a nomination. Robbins carries the film and his performance is truly one of the greatest I have ever seen. The bottom line is that The Shawshank Redmption is a perfect movie. It takes you in from the opening scene and doesnt let you go until long after it comes to a tremendous close. Along the way it will make you think fear wonder and feel a number of other emotions. If you have not seen this movie waste no time  go rent it today and see why this is the highest ranked film on IMDb.  positive,The Dark knight is the second part of Batman franchise with Christian bale The movie is great with solid acting performing action directing. everything is perfect the ensemble of the cast is great. Watched Dark Knight Rises as well. the Batman franchise with Christian bale is the best. Dark knight is one of my favourite movies of all times because of the action and of course i love Christian bales acting. i sure do hope that there is another Batman movie after Dark Knight Rises because i can see this from every fan that its gonna break all the records. just like Dark Knight Rises topped all the charts. I loved Heath Ledgers acting as well nice to see some Aussies doing great in Hollywood loved the part where he blows up the hospital and the way he walks i even met Christian Bale in person he is a great guy doesnt disappoint his fans. I really Really hope that they make another batman movie with Christian bale in it and Anne Hathaway they look cute together or they could make Batman and Robin hood.positive,The Dark Knight is the quintessential comic book meets realism film. Heath Ledger and Aaron Eckhart knock it completely out of the park. Every single character shows the most growth/development having to compromise their own personal opinion. It is a non-stop start to finish thrill ride with a detective story woven in. Some men just want to see the world burn I just want to watch this movie again and again. Gary Oldman and Maggie Gyllenhall really shine in their roles. You wont even notice Katie Holmes departure. Christian Bale is still a fairly terrible Batman but he makes for a damn good Bruce Wayne. The final minutes of this film were so powerful that they are still debated despite being put to rest with the opening of the third movie.positive,The Dark Knight is the long awaited sequel to 2005s critically acclaimed Batman Begins and the second part of Christopher Nolans Batman trilogy. It stars Christian Bale Michael Caine Gary Oldman and Morgan Freeman who reprise their role from Batman Begins. New to the cast are Maggie Gyllenhaal replacing Katie Holmes as Rachel Dawes Aaron Eckhart as Gothams ambitious new DA Harvey Dent and Heath Ledger as infamous Batman villain The Joker. The premise of this movie is that Batman and Lieutenant Jim Gordon one of the citys few in-corrupt cops are trying to take down the Mob with the help of Harvey Dent Gothams White Knight. However while focusing on bringing The Mob down a new threat emerges  hes under a life sentence for murder. Tim Robbins is Andy a smart banker and accounting whiz who was sentenced to 2 life terms for killing his wife and her lover which he--like most other inmates say theyre not guilty of. And Bob Gunton is Warden Norton who when we first meet him is touting the virtues of Bible reading and strict discipline. While fortunately Ive had no first hand experience Shawshank certainly gives the feel of authenticity of prison life and its society. A long movie most of it takes place inside a semi-corrupt state penitentiary in the late 1940s. Red in talking his thoughts out loud to himself becomes our narrator for many developments. As the story unfolds increasingly we come to see Andy as a person with strong personal values which he upholds in the most difficult situations. And in Andys work for Warden Norton we also increasingly find the warden as morally his opposite: selfish and fundamentally lacking decent moral character--all show and appearance and with no integrity substance. In Roger Eberts first review of his two of this movie he said: ....the film is an allegory about holding onto a sense of personal worth despite everything....the word redemption is in the title for a reason.... Most viewers will agree. positive,The dark knight is the best super hero movie till done and one of the best movies ever created in Hollywood.. Christopher Nolan created a masterpiece he is known to create some original Screenplays in Hollywood.. And he has done that in this batman movie too.. This movie is unforgettable by Nolans treatment to a superhero movie and the brilliant performance by Heath Ledger... A charismatic performance that earned him an Postmoustly Oscar.. We will miss him and he will be always remembered as THE JOKER.. A new way of approach than Jack NIcholsons Joker and he Nailed it.. Christian Bale and Aron Eckheart are also doing an amazing work But its all overshadowed by Heath Ledgers performance... Instead of a usual fantasy film this batman movie goes to the dark side and took it seriously.. while watching this movie we could say that this super hero is truly a human.. A must watch movie for every batman fan and every good movie fanpositive,The Dark Knight is second movie of Christopher Nolans Batman Trilogy and released in 2008 after three years from first movie Batman Begins. Normally sequence movies cannot catch the same success with first one but The Dark Knight surpassed it and gone way beyond expectations. Its first movie has 8.3 point on IMDb and Dark Knight got 9.0 point and became 6th of top 250 IMDb. All three movies are inspired by Batman Comics but it has some changes. In this version Nolan had chosen to use The Joker as an antagonist to Batman. In whole movie we saw a sort of competition between Batman and Joker. Joker tries to prove that everybody has a dark side even the nice ones and how insanity is close to people he says madness as you know is like gravity all it takes is a little push. When everything is getting worse Joker manages to turn movies nicest and heroic man Harvey Dent into Two-Face which is also a fictional character in Batman comics. Addition to its well developed story its visual effects are amazing. Although it lasts two and a half hours I did not want it to end even a second. Actually the biggest reason I love this movie that I think it is a Joker movie instead of Batman. The first scene of the movie starts with The Joker Theme which is one of the soundtracks of the movie. I think it is a really good choice to makes audience tense and get ready to watch an action movie. Then while Jokers crew rob bank we get some information about Joker. After the robbery he kills all of his men I believe that is a good way to introduce audience with his carelessness and mercilessness. He manages to escape from the bank by enter a school buses traffic and we meet his intelligence right there. After a few scenes later Joker entered gangsters of Gotham Citys special meeting and when they about to kill him he puts a pencil on a table and says  I am going to make this pencil disappear when one of the body guard comes near to him he grab his head push to pencil then pencil disappears. I know loving this scene makes me a sort of masochist but if I had watched it in a horror movie I would not like it I like the way Nolan build the conversation and the scene. Later on at that scene Joker offers to kill Batman and if he kills they will give him their half of money. They say you are crazy and do not agree with him he leaves to them his card. I like this symbol very much because the card is the Joker card of playing cards which we use in our daily life to play card game. On the other side Batman just develops his equipments I think Nolan make our expectations higher in this progress. I was really curious about what will happen when the two enemies meets. Joker kills the people who inspired by Batman and wears like him acts like him. Joker hangs one of them and put a note on his fake batman costume  Will the real Batman please stand up . I really like the little tease in there there is a song by Eminem the real slim shady he says the real slim shady please stand up and he is the real slim shady he calls for himself because there is a lot of people who tries to imitate him. Joker does the same thing in movie he want real Batman to take off his mask and show himself otherwise Gotham will not be a peaceful city. I really like the way he treats him. He does not have a real purpose to do all his action or terror he just does these because he is insane. In other movies they generally give us a background about antagonist their life or why they are bad we know all things but in this movie Joker does not have even a finger print history on governments database. We do not know even why he has scars on his face but in the movie he tells two different stories about it. The famous catch phrase why so serious comes in here. These stories have one thing in common actually it is about smiling. He leads chaos and he has always a smile on his face this is a good symbol to show his satisfaction from the situation he made. Though he wears no heavy costume like Batman wears he can handle with Batman how does it possible He always uses Batmans weakness. Batman has ethics Joker does not. In this movie Batman obsesses with Rachel and Joker use this very intelligently and mercilessly. Besides Joker leaves clues about who is he going to kill next of course these are not ordinary citizens. He chooses a judge a commissioner and Harvey Dent. He sends even a message to the judge. When we see his message which is his card we understand that Joker is going to do something. But the judge does not realize it. I like the irony in there. Even police officers tell her to be careful and give her a letter which writes that where should she goes to be safe. As an answer to them the judge says that I am get used to these people and then she gets on her car. Then she opens letter and it writes  UP . The car explores and it scatters The Joker Card. This is one of my favorite scenes. He knows how he can leave his signature after accident happens. He also chooses people like him to make part of his crew. One of them is a schizoid and when Harvey Dent gets him he cannot tell anything logically about Joker. They cannot reach Joker due to the way he works.positive,The dark knight is one of my favorite movies of all-time. I really didnt expect much before i saw the film but when i did i was complete blown away. This is the way superhero movies should be made instead of making forgettable popcorn flicks. All actors that includes Christian bale heath ledger Aaron Eckhart Michael Cain Gary Oldman Maggie Gyllenhaal Morgan freeman brought There A game in the superhero drama. This movie isnt overrated because it deserves all the credit its Been getting including heath ledgers performance as the joker. The movie had a great script thanks to Christopher Nolan and his brother Jonathan. The acting cinematography action and editing is outstanding and all the film crews did a phenomenal job. Id like to thank the director Christopher Nolan for influencing me as an aspiring filmmaker and putting a lot of heart into The Dark Knight. 10 out of 10positive,The Dark Knight is my favorite movie ever made partly because Im a huge Batman fan but also just because its simply put one of the best movies ever made. This is the sequel to the reasonably successful and marginally critically acclaimed Batman Begins which was a good start but hardly fantastic due to its at times slow pace and lack of all-star villains. The sequel on the other hand makes up for that tenfold with its masterful storytelling and amazing villains. In this story Gotham is a better place than before Batman with less mobsters and criminals on the streets but when a crazed criminal calling himself the Joker Heath Ledger begins subjecting the citizens of Gotham to his chaos and anarchy Batman Christian Bale must step in. Possibly the only way Batman can stop this evil lunatic is with the help of Lt James Gordon Gary Oldman and Gothams white knight District Attorney Harvey-Dent Aaron Eckhart. The scene is complicated when the Joker moves to corrupt the entire city including Harvey Dent and all hope could be lost. The movie is filled with classic catchphrases and scenes mainly thanks to the Joker such as Why so serious and Lets put a smile on that face. The character the Joker is one of if not the greatest villains in cinematic history because of his immense presence classic and thought provoking dialog and of course the Oscar winning posthumous performance of the late great Heath Ledger. The character is the exact Ying to Batmans Yang in every way and if there was ever going to be a villain to beat Batman and go against his moral code it would The Dark Knights Joker. Speaking of Heath Ledger his acting is absolutely first class in this movie. Ledger locked himself in hotel room for a month prior to shooting The Dark Knight so he could get the character right and boy did it work. He also designed the Jokers creepy and menacing make- up and co-directed and directed a couple of scenes featuring the Joker. This performance is one of the greatest by an actor for quite some time and will never be forgotten. Other than Heath Ledger the acting in the movie is still really great with Christian Bale reprising his role as Batman while still doing his gravely Batman voice which I actually quite like. Aaron Eckhart plays a fantastic Harvey dent and has good chemistry with Maggie Gyllenhaal who plays his love interest Rachel. The directing by Christopher Nolan is magnificent giving the film a gritty and realistic feel while also keeping the audience caring about the characters. The way he used mostly practical effects for the movie also helped the movie along by making it stand out a bit from other blockbuster movies like the Transformers movies which are just an orgy of CGI and loud noises. This movie on the other hand is subtle while also being a very strong and forceful movie by having strong themes and ways of conveying them. The story and the overall tone of the film is much more than just a comic movie its a dark and serious action/drama film. This is technically a comic book movie although it really doesnt have any supernatural themes or anything that really makes a movie a comic book movie like The Avengers or Spider-Man. This movie could easily have happened in our world thats how believable the movie really is. To compare this movie to other comic book movies is unfair to comic book movie because this is no ordinary movie this is a fantastic masterpiece of film. Although the highlight of the movie is the Joker this is first and foremost a Batman story and a damn good one. This film delves like no other into the mindset and psyche of Batman and his moral code. Batman will never kill anyone even his greatest enemy which can be a big advantage to his opponent but it gives him a mantra and code to live by. The Joker pushes Batman to the absolute limits like no other villain has before which is just another reason why its the greatest Batman story of all time. The only problems with the movie are more nit-picking mistakes rather than actual problems with the movie. The mistakes are continuity errors with the color of the Joker hair changing in the opening scene and his arm moving back and before around Batmans arm between cuts in one scene. Every movie makes mistakes and these are just two little annoying errors most people wont notice unless they see the movie as many times as I have. Dark Knight is a wonderfully awesome film with fantastic acting directing writing and is just about an all-round perfect in every way film. I do not say this about many films because most films have gaping plot holes or stupid characters but this film doesnt. I would recommend this movie to just about anyone except if youre a grandma maybe you wont like it so much. Its the closest a movie has ever come to being perfect. I rate this movie a 10/10.  the most prominent one being Gil Bellows late as Billy of Ally McBeal as Tommy a fellow inmate of Andys who suffers under the iron will of Norton. If you havent seen this movie GO AND RENT IT NOW. You will not be disappointed. It is positively the best movie of the 90s and one of my Top 3 of all time. This movie is a spectacle to move the mind soul and heart. 10/10 positive,The Dark Knight is everything I wanted a Batman film to be and it has that level of darkness that a lot of superhero films just dont have. The story has a lot of depth. The cast is great. The way Nolan used Chicago as his Gotham made the film look larger than life. There is a sense of realism compared to pre-Nolan Batman films. I could go on and on especially since Batman is my favorite superhero and that character played a huge role in my childhood whether it was the cartoons or the Burton/Schumacher films. People say that they had a problem with Christian Bales Batman voice but to me personally it doesnt take away from the film because the essence of the character is still there. Heath Ledgers Joker in my opinion has a become an iconic villain of cinema. Unlike Jack Nicholsons portrayal of the Joker Heath Ledgers Joker will actually disturb you more than make you laugh. I always identified The Joker with the animated series version voiced by Mark Hamill. That was the iconic Joker but to have an actor being able to rise to that standard and reinvent a super villain was something I really did not expect before I even saw The Dark Knight. And that is really evident especially when Batman and Joker are both on screen. Every interaction between them somehow brings back my memories of watching the animated series only this time its live action and its more mature and darker than I ever imagined my favorite superhero and supervillain to be. I could go on about the rest of the cast such as Michael Cane Gary Oldman and Aaron Eckhart for their fantastic portrayal of the characters. Not only is this a fantastic superhero film but this is also a fantastic piece of cinema. If I could ever go back in time to witness this film for the first time over and over again I would just to feel the aura of excitement coming from me and everyone in the theater. I didnt know what to expect with The Dark Knight just as much as I did not know what to expect with Batman Begins. I was expecting a good ol superhero story but instead I was watching a reinvented Batman and a re-imagining of the story I always knew of the character. The old Batman films were fun for me as a child but the rebooted franchise definitely inspired me to read the graphic novels that played a part in influencing Nolans vision. Every scene is shockingly dark captivating but most importantly iconic and memorable and I sure hope that this film has a far reaching influence on other superhero films because the film really set the bar for the genre. Every other superhero I will watch unfortunately will be compared to The Dark Knight and it will be judged based on that film. These are the only superhero films of its kind and the fact that it stands out from the rest shows how much quality the film has and how much it gets right. The Dark Knight is a classic in every sense of the word not just as a superhero film but as a work of storytelling in general.positive,The Dark Knight is based upon the Batman characters created by Bob Kane and is a follow up to 2005s Batman Begins. I remember in some earlier reviews of mine this year that I stated that I didnt even know if I would end up going to see The Dark Knight. After giving Batman Begins a perfect rating on this site you are probably wondering why I wouldnt want to see a sequel to a film I enjoyed so much. Well when I saw Batman Begins in the theatres I thought it had a lot of style action and kept me compelled and entertained and I found it a really good time at the movies. Hence the perfect review I gave it three years ago. Then I saw it again on DVD and I did not like it at all. The thrills and excitement were gone and everything that held up so well the first time had vanished and rather than seeing all the good things I enjoyed about it on my first viewing instead on my second viewing I found parts of it boring and I started to have a few problems with the acting performances. I still kept the rating on this site to a 10 because that was my first initial reaction to the film but after not enjoying the film much at all seeing it a second time and having been entirely sick and tired of all the superhero films coming out this year I really couldnt have cared less if I saw The Dark Knight at all. Then all of the really good reviews for the film came pouring in all over the internet and I kept hearing how dark and bleak this version was and I even heard of one critic who couldnt recommend the film because of how dark it was. This intrigued me because I have always been a fan of darker fare and the fact that family members saw the film and told me that I would really like it ended up in me seeing it. And to my surprise I thought it was as close to perfect as a superhero film could possibly get and I would most certainly call it a masterpiece. The acting was all top notch from every performer involved especially by the late Heath Ledger who played the role of the Joker. I have seen Heath Ledger in other films such as Brokeback Mountain or Im Not There and to play this role he isnt more or less playing himself but instead going totally out of character and playing a twisted and menacing psychopath and everything the Joker says does and the evil in his facial expressions show that he is a true terrorizing evil. All of this is perfected by Heath Ledger who gives the best performance of this year so far and I would compare his performance as the Joker to last years best performance of Daniel Day Lewis as Daniel Plainview in There Will Be Blood. Day Lewis won an Oscar this year so I see no reason why Heath Ledger couldnt get nominated or even win the award in his memory seeing as he tragically passed away earlier in the spring. His performance was one of the best parts of the film. What was also so good about the film besides the top notch acting direction and cinematography was its story. Instead of being filled by non stop explosions high tech gadgets and over blown self indulgent special effects this film instead mostly focused on the characters and for each one involved we are driven deep into their minds to see the madness of the villains and the good and also troubled lives of the others including Batman himself. The character study here is so fascinating that anyone taking a sociology or psychology course couldnt help but be interested. The story in the film had me drawn in from start to finish and I liked the menacing and dark tone to the film which I found all the more interesting and I liked how this film did not use formulas or clich’©s and instead gave us a straight out story that you would not know how it ended till the end credits rolled. The Dark Knight really hit me and made an impression on me. Even days after leaving the theatre I am still thinking about the film and certain scenes and characters in it. This is what I call a powerful thought provoking and stay with you film that is so good that it has almost a power to remain in your mind like this. The Dark Knight is a brilliant achievement and I will go as far to say that it is the best superhero film I have ever seen simply because it is not like other superhero movies and this is also the best mainstream film of the year so far and I hope it is not shunned come Oscar time.positive,The Dark Knight is arguably the best movie Ive ever seen on the big screen. It has everything that a viewer would want in a good film. The director has done a fantastic job. Christian Bale is the best Batman/Bruce Wayne..I cant imagine anyone else filling for him. Even the bad guys in this movie are awesome. The point that you dont know anything about the Joker makes him a questionable character  get it . The Joker cant kill Batman because hes just too fun and Batman has his own rules that he cant break  such as killing a man . The transformation of Harvey Dent was scary and the 50/50 chance of him murdering someone is even scarier because nobody knows who will survive. Chance is unbiased said Harvey. The ending is also quite atrocious for Bales character. He has to disappear or else hell be hunted. Why is he running dad - J.G juniorpositive,The dark knight is an perfect attempt from Nolan to show actual dark side of society. Where hero must pay penalty for chaos created by villain. This is an critic and perfectly meant to disclose acting skills of each comic characters of batman franchise. All credits has been given to Ledger who drove this movie from an ordinary comic movie to epic one. Interviews of Heath was perfectly showing how much Heath was involved in character the joker observed lip sucking gestures in interviews. Any where we never saw Heath in movie instead it was an agent of chaos. This movie is never overrated. this movie is over qualified for ratingpositive,The Dark Knight is an amazing movie the script is very well written the acting the visual effects its really hits you on an emotional level which is something most films dont do nowadays. I recommend it to everyone who loves Batman even if you dont like Batman youll still love this movie. It is probably Christopher Nolans most successful films next to Inception. If you want to be emerged in a real life Gotham then this is the movie to see though the old batman films portray a very comic book-like Gotham this one shows that anything including the villains even batman is very possible to happen. If you enjoyed the origin youll most definitely like this one. It has your action adventure comedy thrown in and out throughout the movie and even your romance.positive,The Dark Knight is an absolute classic and is not only one of the best Superhero/Comic Book films ever made but also one of the best Sequels ever made. Filled with Powerful directionBrilliant Acting performances and excellent ActionThe Dark Knight is Christopher Nolan at his best and most powerful. Set after the events in Batman BeginsThe Dark Knight now tells the story about how now Batman/Bruce WayneChristian Balehas to not only deal with the Mobbut also has to deal with a psychotic criminal named The JokerHeath Ledgerwho wants the destroy Gotham City and make the innocent corrupt. The Dark Knight is a powerful and unforgettable Classic that came out month after Heath Ledgers tragic death which cast a shadow over the film and with or without Ledger presence The Dark Knight is still an excellent film. With The Dark Knight Christopher Nolan has created an unforgettable cinematic experiencegiving viewers a bigger and larger film than Batman Begins because when you look at Batman Begins as great as it is you feel like Nolan was taking a test drive with a car and trying to know the Batman worldbut with The Dark Knight Nolan does not a take a test and knows this world from the ground up. With TDK Nolan gives viewers a true epic scope raising the Superhero genre to another level and makes a complex film filled with tragedy and sadness. TDK while definitely a Superhero/Comic Book film has much more in common with a Crime Drama because of gangsters and the Mob always in the film and the Cops and lawyers that are always trying to stop them and The Joker while also dealing with Money and corruption. You feel like you are watching a Superhero film if it were directed by Martin Scorsese or Michael Mann because like the Crime Dramas of those two films TDK deals with many characters and themes such as the crimecorruption and moral ambiguity. In other words TDK has more in common with Epic Crime Dramas like The GodfatherGoodfellasCasinoThe Departed and Heat than say The Fantastic Four films. Nolan creates a world in TDK where there is a since of doom and dread all around where the city of Gotham is being held hostage and just filled with tension and falling apart and waiting to explode in a shred of darkness. Batman and The Joker in this is a true story of Good and Evil with Batman trying to defend and protect the citizens of Gotham City and trying to bring some good into the city and does not killbut The Joker is different because The Joker is true evil that just wants to see Gotham City burn and corrupt the innocent people of the city including Batman himself. The Joker believes that people in general are not good and can be brought down to his level of darkness. The film is battle but a complex one because Batman asks himself this question:What can I do at all costs to stop The Joker Can Batman do it the right way or could Batman kill The Joker and be brought down to The Jokers level TDK is a chess game and also a Cat and Mouse game where Batman is not only trying to save Gotham but trying to beat The Joker. The screenplay by Christopher Nolan and Jonathan Nolan is superb with dialog and scenes that are something William Shakespere would write because the film is filled with sadness and darkness all over. Although the film is long at 2 Hours and 32 minutes the movie moves by so fast you would think that you were watching a 90 minute film than a two and half hour film. The Action scenes in the film are masterful and are much more intense than in BB. The Action is filled with great suspense and jaw-dropping visuals and will have you glued to the screen. The ending of the film lasts about 20-30 minutes and like I said before this film will have you glued to the screen but also on the edge of your seat leaving you wanting more. It is a greatsad and tragic conclusion that will leave asking questions and prepares viewers for The Dark Knight Rises. The whole cast does great jobs in their roles. Christian Bale is excellent once again as Batman/Bruce Wayne bringing depthtoughness and sadness to the role. The late Heath Ledger earned a Best Supporting Actor Oscar for his brilliant and terrifying performance as The Joker. Ledgers performance is scarymenacing and masterful making Ledgers Joker one of the greatest villains in movie history. Aaron Eckhart is great as Harvey Dentan idealistic lawyer. Michael Caine is great once again as AlfredBruces Butler. Maggie Gyllenhaal does a good job as RachelBruce and Harveys love interest. Gary Oldman is fantastic once again as Officer Jim Gordon. Morgan Freeman is great once again as Lucius FoxBatmans weapon maker. Eric RobertsMaroniAnthony Michael HallMike EngelRichie CoasterChechenCillian MurphyScarecrowand Nathan GambleJames Gordan Jr.give good performances as well. The direction by Christopher Nolan is masterful and brilliantwith Nolan using great camera angles and giving the film a haunting and beautiful visual style and also does great job in the Action scenes. Great direction from Nolan. The  by Hans Zimmer and James Newton Howard is excellentdark and intense and matches the gritty and grim tone of the film. Amazing  by Zimmer and Howard. In final wordif you love BatmanChristopher NolanComic Book filmsSuperhero films or films in generalI Highly suggest you see The Dark Knightone of the best sequels ever made and a true classic that you can watch again and again. Highly Recommended. 10/10.positive,The Dark Knight is a superhero movie with a darker twist making it more interesting and thrilling than the other Batman movies in the past. Christopher Nolans trilogy set a new premise for the comic book tale. The characters her created were more realistic and less cartoonish. The theme of Dark Knight is good vs. evil. We have several characters such as Aaron Eckharts Harvey Dent and Maggie Gyllenhaals Rachel who are fighting the evil doers of Gotham. While they are fighting through the law to clean up Gotham we have Chriatian Bales character Bruce Wayne/Batman who is working as a vigilante to clean up Gotham as well. One of the most captivating characters of the movie is Heath Ledgers Joker. In all the movies before we have never seen the Joker played as such a psychotic manic as Ledger portrayed him. The casting of this character was perfectly done and the execution was flawless. Even though he was the villain he was captivating and drew you in from the first scene of him standing on that street corner with his back toward you. He always kept you guessing and you never knew what he might do next. Since the theme of the film was darker the scenes are darker as well. Even during the day time scenes are overcast and dark. There never seems to be any light in the city of Gotham. The creators of the film used this specifically to emphasis the darkness that plagues the city and what the heroes are constantly facing. As the movie progresses we see that even the evil starts to have its effects on the good guys. The Joker captures Harvey and Rachel and is playing the Batman against the police force as to who should be saved. Batman wants to save Rachel because he loves her the police want to save Harvey because he is one of their own. Batman however ends up with Harvey and saves him while Rachel gets blown. When the scenario goes wrong and Harvey spills the oil barrel he is drenched in gas when the explosion occurs as they are escaping. With Harvey losing Rachel and getting burned he turns from good to evil and seeks his own revenge for what has happened to those he loved. Harvey becomes Two Face. The transition of Harvey from good to evil is one of Gothams greatest secrets and we see that its carried on into The Dark Knight Rises. Overall this movie is very well done and sets a precedents for superhero movies. We can see that no matter how old you are you can always renew your love for good vs evil depending on how its done. Introducing the darker aspect to the beloved comic was a great accomplishment for Christopher Nolan and his complex vision brilliantly displayed by the actors on the screen.positive,The Dark Knight is a revelation in film making-both comic book and regular. Usually I give comic book movies slack since the actors arent meant to be brilliant he plot is not meant to be mind-bending and meaningful and the theme is supposed to be something along the lines of Heroes will always be there to save the day. However if I give Christopher Nolans masterpiece The Dark Knight slack I would be driving myself insane to put an infinity out of ten for the rating. The Dark Knight needs no slack put on it it is a GREAT film. Starting off with the acting Ill end with The Joker Alfred Michael Caine Bruce Wayne/Batman Christian Bale Lucius Fox Morgan Freeman and Harvey Dent Aaron Eckhart pull off the second best part of the film the acting is...Beautiful. Yes these actors are beyond good however the main attraction is Heath Ledgers version of The Joker. You feel as if Ledger is actually as insane as The Joker and his acting is beyond brilliant and beautiful to the thousandth power RIP. However that is only the acting the plot is GREAT and the theme is something we should all remember. I wont spoil anything though you deserve to watch this movie for yourself. Or better yet IT deserves for you to watch it. OVERALL: The Dark Knight is quite possibly the best movie I have ever seen the acting plot theme directing-I could go on-is just magnificent. If you havent seen it simply because its a Batman movie you are truly missing out. Nolans work of art is so brilliant and good that The Dark Knight isnt even a Batman movie anymore. If you havent seen it you are truly missing out on something extraordinary.positive,The Dark Knight is a rare example of a movie where *everything* is in place. Christopher Nolan doesnt cut corners. This movie easily surpasses even the highest expectations and I immensely enjoyed watching it. The plot was convincing and original. The script was smooth and clever. The dialogues were interesting and memorable. The camera work was top quality. There was absolutely no scene where I would think something like hey Ive seen this before *and* the original was better or hmm this served no purpose. Heath Ledgers performance was outstanding. I mean others were great too Christian Bale Gary Oldman Michael Caine but... Heath who portrayed the Joker was just brilliant. Unlike many other movie villains who are basically pitiful clowns his clown is a true villain. Hes the guy you dont want to encounter even if youre a masked vigilante because the price is too great. The Joker has no weaknesses and no inhibitions. Like the devil himself hes smart charismatic dedicated scary and in his own sick and morbid way funny. Worse yet he corrupts people he finds the seeds of evil in the darkest corners of their souls. The Dark Knight is a true masterpiece. Even if you dont like Batman movies in general chances are youll enjoy this one. 10/10positive,The Dark Knight is a masterpiece in cinema with a very dark tone. With terms of direction an story telling I found this movie to be interesting because I already saw the Batman Begins. When I saw the Dark Knight it was nothing like the Tim Burton films we saw. It was dark and terrifying. The Joker was the reason why I was on the edge of my seat. Its the movie that holds the standards to filmmaking. The writing and the direction was great chemistry of essential filmmaking. Christopher Nolan is amazing architect of story telling and directing. The cast was great. Christain Bale played a great batman in this role. But the joker was the one stole the show. I would recommend that you buy this movie. Its awesome.positive,The Dark Knight is a film of many talents that puts director Christopher Nolan on a high list of directors who have made masterpieces but this tops any other film you are thinking about right now. The cast are tremendous and put performances in like youve never seen. This movie came out in 2008 and still to this day is held as one of the best movies created by man. May i say the IMAX scenes are spectacular to date. And one last thing the script it is perfection and will give you such memorising lines to quote to your friends if you ever go to a fancy dress party dressed as a character from this movie.If you havent seen this film then find some time and watch it because you will be amazed at how bloody good it is.positive,The Dark Knight is a brilliant follow-up to Batman Begins and the definitive Batman movie to date which makes you wonder if Christopher Nolan will be able to accomplish like this again. The Dark Knight takes place in a world where the line between good and evil is drawn in pencil. With The Jokers lunatic smile and gleefully malicious manner setting the tone for a wild romp through a world gone mad. Batmans universe is teetering on the edge and the conflicted superhero is trying to unravel the puzzle of how best to protect Gotham City while believing hes not the savior his city deserves. 2005s Batman Begins introduced Christian Bale in the dual roles of Bruce Wayne and Batman and The Dark Knight serves to cement the fact he is the perfect casting choice to shoulder the lead in the Batman film franchise. Gotham Citys falling to pieces and Batman is both the problem and the solution. The caped crusader has taken down a king-sized helping of bad guys although hes not working on his own. Ordinary citizens have taken up his cause donning their own Batman costumes and patrolling the streets. And now the mobsters left in town have joined forces in order to keep the real Batman at bay. No disrespect meant to Jack Nicholson but this is the performance of The Joker everyone will remember. Nicholsons Joker in Tim Burtons 1989 Batman fit perfectly with the tone of that movie. In The Dark Knight its Ledgers Joker the rest of the cast needs to keep step with. This Joker is nasty-scary a greasy grotesque creature lifted straight from the nightmares of coulrophobics. Even those not given to fearing clowns are going to recoil in fright from Ledgers mesmerizing performance. The Dark Knights action sequences are controlled chaos with cars and motorcycles and Mack trucks careening down city streets and the films quieter moments are equally as engaging. Theres just so much to say about The Dark Knight so much I want to analyze and discuss but expanding on a review of the plot would lay out potential spoilers and its best to go into the film without any knowledge of the story line other than the bare minimum. Nolan and company have surpassed what they accomplished the first time out and The Dark Knight is everything youd want from a superhero movie and much much more.positive,The Dark Knight in my regard had been the best directorial impression of Christopher Nolan in the past and probably will always be . The movie has a script beautifully knit with an amazing background  by Hans Himmler. Unlike its prequel the Dark Knight does not engage the audiences with an antagonist who focuses on destruction and who loves his own selfishness to make others suffer. Instead the Joker who is believed to be a lunatic hinted in the Batman Begins has more rights to be called the protagonist. I write with an assurance that his role has the highest credibility to vouch for than anyone else in the movie. His persona as the Joker suits incredibly fit to what Nolan wants to capture the audience with and I am sure we all fall prey to it. There are turns and twists in the script rendering the audiences with ample surprises and bolstering action sequences and a decent merge with a breath taking climax. The movie as I have noticed after my 37 watches doesnt allow you to take your mind off at any instant and always engrosses you with your highest expectations. Nonetheless your expectations will always be fulfilled to the fullest. A wonderful script and well nevertheless immaculately directed.positive,The Dark Knight in my opinion was the most remarkable action movie I have ever seen. The storyline action scenes make-up and actors make the movie feel like its not a movie at all. Its real life. The storyline is creative and memorable. The beginning has a great hook and makes you suspicious. At first I found this movie to be kind of scary and dark only because Im deathly afraid of clowns. But as the movie progressed I began to fall in love with it. The action scenes in this movie are so fantastic theres no word to describe it. The Joker constantly comes up with new games and adventures. My favorite scene was when the Joker was driving the truck and Batman flipped it over. I have never seen anything like thatpositive,The Dark Knight in my opinion has to be the best of the Dark Knight trilogy. With its dark background and superb acting this has to go down as one of the best Batman movies ever made. Heath Ledger delivers as the Joker. Christian Bale is also good at playing the role as Batman and Bruce Wayne. All of the other supporting actors and actresses did a splendid job of doing their part. This has to be one of Christopher Nolans best masterpieces out of all his movies. The many action sequences in the film deliver with great camera angles and amazing stunts. The way Heath Ledger portrayed the Jokers evil side was tremendously good in many ways. Bale is also tremendous too bad we wont be seeing him in the Batman v. Superman movie. If you are a Batman I recommend watching this movie you will not be disappointed.positive,the culmination of sfx cgi props makeup costumes soundtrack casting and marvel storyline with a very good dose of humor thrown in make this unique new film an absolute masterpiece over and above anything remotely similar thus far the unrivaled beauty of zoe saldana whom i was mesmerized by in columbiana simply shines in this role what an asset to any production a star studded cast provides a secure balance to the entertainment with acting youve come to expect from a handful of the very best in the business if you love sci fi adore the seemingly endless array of futuristic gadgets weapons and beings while firmly grasping a reality check with retro objects such as the ever prominent walkman then this film will not disappoint another highlight is definitely the soundtrack whereby a multitude of well known songs are used in some a little odd at first though they do grow on you and are totally fitting if i could id rate this 11 out of 10 enjoypositive,the chief conceit of boyhoodfollowing the same characters over twelve filmed yearswould be little more than a gimmick in a lesser directors hands but under richard linklaters gentle guidance it becomes a singular achievement a film as freshly conceived as it is entertaining and thoughtful linklaters primary concern here is time and the ways we process our awareness of it his conclusionthat we are really of the momentseems borne out by the episodic way in which he depicts a child ellar coltrane who seems to grow into the role as he ages ultimately becoming remarkable simply by being identifiable experiencing events both mundane and lifechanging encounters with alcoholic stepfathers are the films most harrowing sequences and you can see coltranes impressions of them being burnished into him coltranes wonderful performance its hard to believe hes actually acting is enhanced by equally impressive work by patricia arquette and surprisingly the usually pretentious ethan hawke the directors daughter lorelei linklater is an absolute delight the film takes its time searching for its ending when it finds it its simple and openended fully appropriate and moving linklater has always been able to zigzag effectively throughout his career effortlessly navigating between hollywood entertainments dazed and confused school of rock and more personal esoteric work waking life before sunrise boyhood seems a watershed moment for him a rumination on what the universality of his themes has meant to himand in their ease and eloquence what they mean to us i cannot recommend this film highly enoughpositive,The casting is top notch Cinematography makes for a gritty realistic crime world. Make-up and Art Direction could not be better. This movie feels really close to Brandon Lees The Crow. I am surprised it did not receive an R- rating due to its dark content and wicked performance by one of the greats in Heath Ledgers Joker. The pacing is excellent as well and the  establishes great character identification. Suspenseful and wicked fun Watch it with the lights out with a bucket of popcorn kick back and be blown out of your seat And here we...gopositive,The campaign for the film was one of the biggest in cinematic history and it didnt disappointpositive,The Best There Was The Best There Is And The Best There Will be .... and those arent for the movie nor for the hero these lines are dedicated to the Villain Heath Ledger truly awesome he is .. simply cant believe how can someone act like that ... sir you truly are an inspiration .. a villain that cant be forgotten ... The Dark knight is an must watch for everyone from the story to acting it just blew my mind simple exceptional .. watched it many times .. and still there is chance of many more .. Cristopher Nolen is best in Batman Series .. i dont think nothing netter will come for years .. Every Word Contains A Deep Meaning and brings goose-bumps for sure .. Batman is truly Awsum .. no one can do it better then Christian Bale ... Just want to say .. Watch the movie .. dont wait for a second .. : s areal history or not  as someone told me its real but i cant believe that cleverness  beverage scene was good when he solved the problem of the officer  i need to see all movies of prisons as prison break but i dont know names as im Egyptian cant now more American movies so i need help in that positive,The best of movie of the rebirth of Batman. The Dark Knight shows how being a vigilante is more dangerous than the comics have portrayed. A lunatic the Joker has zero remorse for human life. Batman and the Jokers depth is made buy a horrific childhood like most of the secret law enforcement and killers that have been apart of our society. The two characters represent light and dark as they are Yin/Yang to each other. One cannot exist without the other. The movie shows how humanity is fragile in the midst of chaos. Chaos can only be conquered or controlled with decisions that at the core represent the human spirit and our desire to fight for our right to live in peace and harmony.positive,the best movie ive seen. The final battle for Middle-earth begins. Frodo and Sam led by Gollum continue their dangerous mission toward the fires of Mount Doom in order to destroy the One RingThe Lord of the Rings is an epic high fantasy novel written by English philologist and University of Oxford professor J. R. R. Tolkien. The story began as a sequel to Tolkiens 1937 childrens fantasy novel The Hobbit but eventually developed into a much larger work. It was written in stages between 1937 and 1949 much of it during World War II.[1] It is the second best-selling novel ever written with over 150 million copies soldpositive,The Best Movie Ive Ever Seen. Im Just Gonna Start Off By Saying I love This Movie. Its One Of My Favorites Of All Time. Thanks to this film for Christopher Nolan Heath Ledger Christian Bale Gary Oldman Morgan Freeman. I advise everyone to watch this film. If you have not yet seen I advise you to watch. I want to stay in your place because once I get pleasure from this film. Christian Bale Was Amazing As Batman. Aaron Eckhart was all right as Harvey Dent/Two-Face. Heath Ledger Also Was Amazing. I Like Heath Ledger As Joker More Than Jack Nicholson. The Batman Series By Christopher Nolan Was And Is Probably One Of The Best Superhero Series Everpositive,The best movie i have ever watched . Heath Ledger was the master piece. The entry of the of Joker was brilliant There are some really exhilarating set-pieces especially the one that kick-starts the proceedings: Nolan starts off with a high-tension high-anxiety bank raid carried out by a dodgy crew all in Joker masks all whispering among themselves about the crazy guy in clown makeup who hired them to do the job. Why isnt he there personally Wait - is he there personally Summary : Batman Christian Bale has been able to keep a tight lid on crime in Gotham City. But when a vile young criminal calling himself the Joker Heath Ledger suddenly throws the town into chaos the caped Crusader begins to tread a fine line between heroism and vigilantism . The plot thrown by the criminal Joker to test the sanity of Batman and the city of Gotham .positive,The best movie ever made period. I wont go on a very long and detailed review on the storywhich is magnificent and perfectI just want to say that this movie is a pure piece of art. The acting was perfect Im really disappointed that the actors didnt have enough recognition for their performances Actually the overall movie was underestimate by the Oscars especially.This movie shows why cinema is an art powerful and heart full art. See this movie youll now what Im talking about. I really tried to notice some gripes or problems but I cant. This movie is touching sad beautiful powerful and perfect. By the way f**k the Academy Awards for dumping this movie and do for Forrest Gump for the trophiesbut its just trophies... Still a shame that they decided that. 11 out of ten totally deserves it.positive,THE BEST BATMAN THAT THERE EVER WILL BE The joker was amazing rip Heath and the acting was on point i love this movie it is a great movie sure some parts made you feel scared of the joker and all but none the less this movie is so good start to end if you have not seen it then go do so you will enjoy it. DO NOT READ ANY FURTHER IF YOU HAVE NOT SEEN IT I AM GOING TO WRITE SPOILERS EXIT NOW I like the part where the joker hits batmans vehicle with a rocket and then it turns into a bike and the computer says goodbye that was so epic and not just that but the part where the joker says how bout alive is so well acted this movie is great in all and shows how the joker can go against batman because he is smart and half the time he has chances to kill him but the joker tricks and stuffpositive,The BEST A perfect slot of the triologie. What a pity that it is over now. Lets wait for the Hobbit Thanks Jacksonpositive,The best  better than the three films ranked above it in the IMDb. Sorry godfather fans but I hated the godfather and do not think it belongs in the top 10 let alone the farce of being number one.AnywaysI got my hands on the extended edition DVDs of ROTK and there is so much extra stuff.The main thing left out of the theatrical release that I wanted to see was the final fate of Saruman.It is included in the extended edition but it doesnt follow the books version. In the book after the ring was destroyedSaruman had fled out of Isengard and came to the Shire with Grima Wormtongue there they tried to take over the Shire with the help of some ruffians and orcs  they were defeated by hobbits led by Merry and Pippin in what was called The Battle Of Bywater.Frodo confronted the defeated Saruman who was brought to BagEnd and banished him from the Shire .However as Saruman was leaving he berated Grima one last time which sent Grima over the edge with hatred he came up behind Saruman and slit his throat and before Frodo could stop them some other hobbits shot Grima dead with arrows. In the extended edition of the movie GandalfAragornGimliLegolas and King Theoden arrive at Isengard where they are greeted by Merry and Pippin there is some small talk and then a conversation between Gandalf and Treebeard.Saruman then appears from the top of his tower with Grima behind him. He sends fire down at Gandalf who repels it and breaks Sarumans staff King Theoden then tells Grima that he can come back to Rohan and all is forgiven to start a new life. Saruman then berates Grima as useless fodder and shoves him to the ground. Grima then gets angry and stabs Saruman in the backhe falls off the tower and gets impaled on a waterwheel that drags him under the water. Legolas shoots Grima with an arrow killing him. I liked the books ending better Peter Jackson evidently thought a major battle at the end of the movie would have been too much excess so he left out the Battle of Bywater much to the chagrin of fans and changed Sarumans death sceneChristoper Lee was majorly poed when it was cut out of the theatrical release-I would have been too as he was also cut from the ending credits in the theatrical releasehe does however get credit in t he extended edition credits. That scene being cut out was one thing I didnt understandthe scene was no more than ten minutes long but Peter Jackson said that the scene was cut out due to time constraints and pacing I dont buy that B/S - Saruman was a major player in the books and that scene should have been included in the theatrical release. I think some Hollywood politics were going on and someone just didnt like Mr Lee being in the third movie- there were rumors that Peter Jackson did not get along with Mr Lee and so he decided to cut Mr Lee out of ROTKs theatrical releaseBrad Dourif also got the snub from the theatrical release. Oh well the film is just pure wondertop notch acting and incredible special effectsthe battle scenes alone are worth watching the 4 plus hrs of extras. If you havent already go buy the extended edition its filled with goodies and extras including the Wellington parade and world premiere event  with clips and video of the stars walking down the street signing autographs.Enjoy LOTR fanspositive,The Battle of Minas Tirith the March on the Black Gate the Quest to Destroy the One Ring. Those are the elements which make this epic fantasy film THE best in the Lord of the Rings trilogy. It contains such an enthralling world of Middle-earth that for the lengthly period of time the movie takes place you lose time in yourself to a world filled with mirth and magic. I think those fans of LOTR Tolkien and fantasy should grab this movie straight away. Oh and try buying the Extended DVD it contains more scenes Appendices and an Easter Egg below the final scene in the scene selection of each Disc. Definitely a 10/10. By HowlingRabbit334positive,The all star casts performance is made by the fantastic script and dialogue in this movie Scene after scene can be recounted which is always the sign of an excellent film Samuel L Jackson quoting the bible is haunting - not a good way to face death Special VHS widescreen edition has a couple of deleted scenes which add extra insight into the finished version of the film Absolutely fantasticpositive,The Acting in the Dark Knight was very well done as was the directing. Heath Ledgers Joker was exactly how I think the Joker should be played and his characteristics were perfect. Christian Bale was also playing the perfect part. I think that The Dark Knight was a lot better than Batman begins I think the Dark Knight had more depth to it. Every part of this film was brilliant the music the acting the atmosphere everything Personally my favourite scene was the opening scene as it sets the film up perfectly. Which is why Im choosing that scene for my GCSE film studies coursework. I think that this is one of the best films i have ever seen. The best film of the year and possibly the decade.positive,The above line is from Contact the novel by Carl Sagan and it is the first thing that came to mind as i thought about writing this review. I truly cannot explain the grandeur of the movie or how seamlessly PJ has integrated it into the trilogy. This is no doubt the best film trilogy ever. TROTK may even be the best movie ever. If not that it certainly deserves a place among the very top of the best movies of all time. While watching the 3 1/4 hour movie for the first time in my life i regretted having read and reread the book just because all the plot twists were known to me but even then i could not help but get gripped by the scene on Mount Doom and the battle of Mins Tirith. I think enough synopsis and explanations etc. have been written about the movie so i would not go into that. Suffice to say that this is a movie for every age every genere. It has elements of Action Romance Sci Fi and some good old good verses evil Epic battles. One thing for Tolkien lovers -- Tolkien was a master of the detail. In the book you can feel the colour of grass the cack on a marble floor and the smell of Orcs. This movie is very much like that in detail. I cannot imagine how exaustive a task it must have been for the effects team to create such minute detail in every creek every cliff every suit of armour. All I can say is that Tolkien would have been proud. I have heard that Christopher Tolkien JRRs son is not impressed by this trilogy. All I can say to him is that he should give it a second look and just see what PJ has tried to accomplish. As for the Oscar season i think the following should go to TROTK Best Picture - TROTK Best Director - PJ Best Supporting actor - Sean Austin Best Special Effects Best  Best Screenplaypositive,Ten Thumbs Up if I had them. Incredible story incredible cast. I would rate this as probably the best film I have ever seen and I have probably seen it a hundred times on cable. I would have to say this would be Morgan Freemans best performance out of all of his films. There should have been an Oscar for him. This film definitely beat out Million Dollar Baby for which he ultimately and finally received his first Oscar. The Academy wasnt all there when Shawshank deserved its due. Robbins played a great part in this film and did an excellent job however Freeman carried the film. A true drama that shows the bond of two people in horrible circumstances. Yes this one is one to own if you dont have it...buy it. You wont be disappointed.positive,Tarantinos Pulp fiction was an amazing film The movie is full of colorful characters electric dialogue and so well casted Every time you watch it it gets better and better Each scene in this movie is so well thought out you will like it every time I would definitely recommend this movie to anybody its one of my favorite movies You can watch it over and over again and it will be great every time The movie is long but entertaining about 2 hours but its definitely worth watching However the film is filled with swearing and lots of violence So I wouldnt recommend the film to kids Some of my favorite scenes in the movie is the Ezekiel 25:17 scene the restaurant robbing scene the jackrabbit slims dancing scene and many more If you still have doubts about Pulp Fiction then you should watch it anyway You might like it  The French New Wave or blaxploitation The Wild Bunch or The Brady Bunch its all grist positive,Tarantino really nails it with this all-time classic There is really nothing wrong with this movie the acting is amazing with Samuel Jackson giving his best performance ever The story is immaculate and the directing is unbeatable The editing and directing go hand-in-hand with the unique pacing and grueling dialog Tarantino definitely is the master behind a camera There are twist and turns throughout this movie that make your head spin The long dialog scenes reads Tarantino all over it and also the thick blood and crazy death scenes I give this movie a 10/10 because it really shows what great acting editing camera work and directing can do to create such a perfect moviepositive,Tarantino never fails to impress with this all time modern classic the film follows the lives of some very interesting characters opening with the Bonny and Clyde duo Pumpkin and Honey Bunny. The film has nothing but everything to do with the duo as the film opens and closes with the two in toe some of the most rememberable one liners of the films contain the duo as they nock off an ordinary LA diner. As the film progresses we are introduced to two new characters Vincent Vega John Travolta and Jules Winnfield  Samuel L Jackson both hired guns en route to a hit. Vincent seems ever the realist slow talking cool and confident Jules the poetic religious man dog. The speeches between the two characters throughout the film are both realistic yet pointless pillow talk that gives the film a somewhat believable quality no matter how far fetched some of the stories may be Tarantino has the nack of making them sound true by adding this banter between scenes almost acting as an air break or rest stop from the action and violence. Later on we meet Mia Wallace Uma Thurman the wife of Marsellus Wallace Ving Rhames The kingpin of the Tarantino underworld. Uma is cool sexy and always something has to say. Her mysterious entrance is made when Vincent Vega is asked by Marsellu if he would take care of her for the night while he is out of town. This in its self is another story and another adventure in the film Vincent takes her out for lunch at the well known but not so famous Jack Rabbit Slims this scene again is one of the most iconic and talked about moments from the film. Here we also also exposed to Tarantinos rockabilly music taste which encompasses the film so well. Bruce Willis makes his way onto the screen in Pulp Fiction as a one hit KO boxerButch Coolidge. his story begins with the Gold Watch story this gold watch symbolises Butchs drive through life as we learn that the watch has survived through many wars struggles and pains if a simple gold watch can make it this far so can butch. His drive through the film is to escape an accidental murder the result of a boxing match however many pitfalls await him and his girlfriend Fabienne Maria de Medeiros Just a light intro to the film and its colourful characters within but all in all a timeless classic and a must see for any film buff or anyone that watches films in this case I struggle to find anyone that doesnt have at least one good thing to say about this film as it contains all the qualities of a masterpiece to be talked about time and time again Hard to believe this film is almost 20 years oldpositive,Tarantino makes great use of non-linear narratives which creates an experience that you will not forget. with a cast of divine actors and a short appearance of Quentin himself makes this movie an experience that will a stay in your mind for a lifetime. although if watching with others some scenes are highly disturbing and may put you off mood the movie is a masterpiece of well written non- linear story and there are plenty of laughs to make up for it. in conclusion if you are deciding whether or not to watch this movie in my opinion you definitely should should as it is an amazing movie and it leave plenty of thought for your imagination.positive,Tarantino is an enigma and most people seem to either love him or hate him: there is no middle ground Is he a brilliant prodigious writer and director who meticulously takes the essence of the hard-boiled crime and detective stories that inspired him growing up and takes their heart and soul and re appropriates it into a story for the modern audience Is he a shameless hack who simply steals from old movies and takes credit for them trying to claim that these old stories are his original ideas The thing is depending on who you ask you will get a different answer Some say yes some say no but the thing is that everyone has an opinion Because when you see a work of art such as this forgetting about any possible derivatives within the story it is impossible to look away Always riveting bloody scary and most of all very funny with Pulp Fiction Tarantino managed to take time-worn stories that had been done hundreds of times before and since and give it a distinctive Tarantino flavor What kinds of hit men discuss Cheeseburgers while going to and from their latest hit The ones in Pulp Fiction do And therein lies the brilliance of this movie as Tarantino made everything that was old seem fresh again through his distinctive auteur style narrative that goes back and forth in time the juxtaposition between street smart cheeky dialog and the horrific actions of the characters and the weird morals within the narrative which presents bad guys as funny and sexy Perhaps the myths surrounding Pulp Fiction do an injustice to the movie itself because so much has been written on the movie it has been critiqued so many thousands of times that watching the movie with the weight of all those expectations can seem a little underwhelming After all it probably wont change your life or inspire in you a life long love for hardboiled noir stories or anything like that Pulp Fiction exceeds in something so much more simple and yet something that so many other filmmakers forget to do: it succeeds in being a brilliant piece of entertainment that will keep you on the edge of your seat for the whole duration And when you get down to it I think being a piece of brilliant entertainment is much better than being a piece of film history But what makes Pulp Fiction so special is that it is bothpositive,Talk about your school of hard knocks. In The Shawshank Redemption Columbia R Andy Dufresne Tim Robbins a tall soft-spoken New England banker is convicted-wrong- ly-of killing his adulterous wife and her lover. Its 1947 and Andy having received a double life sentence is shipped off to Shawshank State Prison in Maine a maximum-security fortress packed to the grimy gills with thieves rapists and murderers. How bad is life at Shawshank So bad that when Andy trudges off the bus along with a dozen other new inmates the veteran prisoners make wagers on wholl be the first to cry. So bad that Andy finds a huge wriggly yellow maggot buried in his lunch. So bad that over the next two years he is systematically beaten and raped by the Sisters a crew of leering renegade inmates who take special delight in tormenting their fellow prisoners. Make no mistake: Andy gets worked over-and so does the audience. But then good things have a way of happening to unfortunate movie characters. Early in his stay Andy makes the acquaintance of Red Morgan Freeman a sly survivor who is serving a life sentence for murder and who acts as Shawshanks one-man black market smuggling the prisoners anything they want-cigarettes reefer cards with naked ladies Im a regular Sears and Roebuck he deadpans. As soon as Andy bonds with Red things start to  look up. He gets hold of a rock hammer so that he can sculpt an elegant chess set. He does the guards tax returns in exchange for perks like beer on a sunbaked afternoon. He expands the dusty neglected book room into the most comprehensive prison library in New England. Set over a period of 20 years the passing decades are marked by Andys pinup posters of Rita Hayworth then Marilyn then Raquel The Shawshank Redemption begins as a nightmare a postwar- New England Midnight Express but it doesnt take long to reveal its true feel-good colors. The movie is about survival triumph and a thing called hope. Its about a hero who rises above the squalor because hes blessed-a saint in the muck. Its Midnight Express Goes Gump. You need a certain craftsmanship to traffic in twin brands of manipulation- the exploitative and the sentimental-and theres no denying that Frank Darabont who wrote and directed The Shawshank Redemption its based on a short novel by Stephen King knows just what hes doing. The moss-dark saturated images have a redolent sensualitypositive,Synopsis Bruce Wayne/Batman Christian Bale continues to eliminate crime in Gotham City with the help of Lt. Jim Gordon Gary Oldman and the new District Attorney Harvey Dent Aaron Eckhart. The Dark Knight wants to finally get rid of organized crime for good and be free of their corruption. Batman soon finds that a new psychopathic mastermind known as the Joker Heath Ledger has taken over organized crime. The Jokers plan is to terrify the citizens and throw the city into chaos and kill Batman. Batman takes the fight with the Joker personal which makes him confront his own beliefs. The Joker is the most dangerous criminal that Batman has encountered and he will need all his strength and vigilance to defeat him. My Comment This film just blew me away. Christian Bale is a natural as Bruce Wayne/Batman and Michael Caine fits the part of Alfred the trusted butler. Heath Ledgers performance as the sadistic Joker was absolutely disturbing and scary yet simply amazing. I would not want to meet the Joker in a dark alley and whatever you do dont ask him how he got his smile especially when he has a knife in his hand. Ledgers performance has turned the Joker into a new iconic movie villain image. Between all the punches mayhem and explosions there is some good sinister dialog. The movie not only has a lot of action it also tells the story of the internal struggle that Bruce Wayne is having with being the Batman hero. Bruce Wayne wants to be himself and maintain the difference between himself and Batman. Bruce must decide to follow the code or do what has to be done without affecting his own morals. The movie explores the literary themes of Hero verses Villain as well as Order verses Anarchy and the Joker explains to Batman that to have one you must have the other and because of that they will always be connected. The movie is long but it went by so fast. You will love the last 45 minutes because of the non-stop action with Batman in his new sonic suit and his BatPod. With all the explosions body count and the dark mood of the movie I dont think parents should take young children. Warner Bros. Pictures Run Time 2:32 Rated PG-1310/10positive,Sure its gory profane and over the top But I havent seen a film this fresh and bursting with new ideas in a very long time although Resevior Dogs was nearly as good I totally expected all the negative comments I saw  this film isnt for everyone But its a lot of fun to watch and this is because of Tarrentionos cool ideas So if your really into film youll probably like this If youre female or liked Titanic or both Im thinkin you probably wont positive,Super Movie DA.

Only thing that i hate is the way Christian Bale speaks when he is batman. Apart from that i love all batman films starring Christian bale. Favourite character is the joker Heath Ledger. Such ashame he isnt here anymore though The Dark Knight Rises is also a great film and for all of yous who havent seen it should go watch it Now Havent heard if they are making another one or not but i really hope that they are such an amazing series and i want more Like i said the only thing i dont like about the films is the way Chrisitan Bale speaks when he is Batman. But yeah its amazingpositive,Stupid people will enjoy this movie but will say its really not all that great. Smart people will say this movie was beautifully done and almost perfect. Yes the ending was long but necessary. Just think of how many characters were built up throughout the three movies. They all deserve an ending. Try to think of the movie as 3 hours long and think of the ending as like the clips they show during the credits or an extra feature or something like that. Somethings I would have liked to see different or removed: { The ending was too perfect. There should have been more tragedy. However you have to remember that Peter Jackson had no control over this. The book was already written a long time ago. The scene with Legolas jumping on that elephant thing should have been removed or somehow reshot to make it seem less crazy. I know elfs are strong and more agile but it was still a little crazy. Maybe some plot changes but the book was written a long time ago so I cannot dis the movie for those. Thats about it I think. } Watch it more than once...read the books if you have the time...and try to understand. Great overall. Peace. Remy.  I mean who else could have played Jules except Samuel L. In conclusion see Pulp Fiction it will be like no other movie youve ever seen if you are worried about the language it fits in with the movie so when you think about it its not really that bad. positive,Straight to the pointhonestly Ive seen a great number of films and very few have reached out to me The characters the film making the drugs the banter between the characters everything in between has all become one and the same under Quentin Tarantinos directing Ive always been intrigued by Samuel L Jacksons portrayal of Jules Winnfield a self proclaimed gangsterrighteous man shepherd and more specifically what makes me interested in this character is that he sees himself as a cleanser of the bad guys his quoting of Ezekiel a biblical passage of epic proportions fits in well with this righteous character and only pulls me in further in this film This is my review of one character specifically but a review none the lesspositive,story mission impossible follows an espionage team known as the imf impossible missions force led by jim phelps jon voight who were on a mission in prague to prevent a diplomat from the nonofficial covers list which is a list of all the secret agents in eastern europe when most of the colleagues in the team get killed the mission had failed and ethan hunt tom cruise was the lone survivor after the mission had failed after that hunt embarks on another mission to clear his name my thoughts although i had never ever watched the original tv show i didnt know what to expect from this movie when i first heard about it after watching mission impossible for the first time seven months ago i thought this was a really enjoyable spy thriller this is one of those movies where you must pay attention from beginning to end because there are some twists in there if you dont pay enough attention youll be really confused on whats going on i thought the plot twists in this movie were pretty shocking and the direction by brian de palma was great also there were only a few action sequences in this movie that were really gripping like the part on the train i was on the edge of my seat during that scene and when tom cruise is in the cia headquarters retrieving a computer disk in a secured room with the help of jean reno and ving rhames which i thought was reallywell shot i would call that scene as a rather quiet one but it was still gripping the acting tom cruise does a great job playing ethan hunt it kind of bugs me that people are saying that tom cruise cant act to save a life well try watching these movies and youll probably like him jon voight did great as the leader of the imf jean reno and ving rhames were great as the two agents who helped ethan on his mission in conclusion mission impossible is a great start to the mission impossible series which it had really good twists good acting especially from tom cruise great direction by brian de palma and it had some great action sequences 1010positive,Stephen Kings powerful prison drama story is brought to life with Frank Darabonts The Shawshank Redemption. The movie tells the story of Andy Dufresne portrayed brilliantly by Tim Robbins who is sent to Shawshank prison when framed as the murderer of his wife and her affair lover. During his time in prison Andy makes an unlikely friendship with smoke dealer Red portrayed by the astounding Morgan Freeman who does an excellent job of guiding the movie with his smoothing and confident narration. Now the rest of the movie talks about Andys struggle to try and break free from Shawshank and the unexpected friendship between two different people. This movie is an astounding masterpiece that can only be spoken through the words of the mysteriously defying Stephen King. Director Frank Darabont helped bring Kings vision to life on the screen and he performed an excellent job as a director and a writer. Also the cast is such a true miracle that the movie was able to get the finest actors to play the most finest cinematic roles. Tim Robbins is excellent Morgan Freeman is astounding Bob Gunton is brilliant and James Whitmore plays such a dramatic small role as Brooks the Shawshank librarian. Also I enjoyed Thomas Newmans breathtaking  the perfect cinematography the excellent use of film editing and the spectacular script. I respected every single moment in this movie and it had me wanting for more. The Shawshank Redemption is one of the best movies ever made and I have never seen a movie with so much heart before even though of its slow 142 minute run-time. The Shawshank Redemption in my review a stunning masterpiece entertainment at its finest.positive,Stephen Kings novella is a damn good yarn. The narrative is always engrossing the source elements of Andys secret are carefully placed without exciting attention and you are delighted when events pan out as they do. Then Darabont adapts it and a damn good yarn becomes something special. Part of this is the adaptation - a sensitive simplification part of it is the casting which is pitch perfect Morgan Freemans Red was always an Irish redhead when I read the story - now I cant read it without seeing Morgan Freeman. And most of it I think is the direction. The story unfolds in unhurried fashion with us being unsure of Andys guilt for much of the movie but with a gradually building sense of injustice at the way those in power in the system can treat him and others unfairly. The secret doesnt come at the end but at about the three quarters mark and brings with it a huge emotional kick. And then the story is allowed to make its own way into a gentle and perfect end. This is without any doubt one of the most spiritually uplifting films I have ever seen.positive,Stephen King is my favourite author and I like most of his books and love some as well. One of the defining features of his books is the characterisation and the atmosphere. No one does it better. This leads to his books being long and slow some times but thats the part of it. This normally doesnt transfer well to cinema where everything is cut and compressed. This movie is better than the book. I read the book and I was impressed I saw the movie and I fell in love with it. The movie focuses on the two main characters and the side stories enhances their character brilliantly. All what comes before ties in to the end. One of the greatest effect in the movie along with the atmosphere is the soundtrack. It plucks at you it pulls at you and it lulls you in to a world where all that you see flows with it smiles with it and cries with it. I wont talk about the story since now after so many reviews we are at a stage where we can talk about other features of this movie. There are many great moments in the movie including the two stage ending both stages immensely enjoyable every time for different reasons. Another great moment for me is the release of Brooks Hatlen from prison. His dialogue delivery Š—_the world went ahead and got itself in to one BIG DAMN hurryŠ—_ and acting is brilliant at that moment and is perfectly captured further ahead in the movie when Red facing similar circumstances confesses Terrible thing to live in fearŠ—_ The same fear can be glimpsed when Red glances fearfully over a stone wall in Buxton to see if he is being pursued or spied upon while he reads a letter. Great acting and direction This movie is about hope and friendship. Those of us who have seen it many times enough to even forget the count are touched by it every time. We now see the movie in its entirety and every magical scene is impressed upon our memory because this is art. The message of eternal hope is wonderfully characterised in Andy and that of friendship in Red.positive,star wars for todays generation and maybe even a little better than that because it is just packed with such fun that i havent experienced in cinema for a long time marvel has outdone themselves once again marvel and disney have been worried that this film will be a financial failure but i havent been in such a crowded theater since the start of the year this origin story of this band of misfits starts out with an emotional scene then the tone changes into this indiana jones in space adventure then it deliberately makes fun of itself and at last all these tones merge into one and the film keeps this tone for the whole length of the film when it needs to be emotional it is when it needs an action scene peppered with humor you get and action scene you havent seen before everzthing in this film works except maybe the main villain he isnt very menacing but you have so much fun in all the other aspects of the film so you are happy to overlook these details plus ronan the accuser serves just as buildup for a much greater threat every character steals every scene they are in there is no way you will be able to pick your favorite character because in every scene suddenly all of them become your favorite chris pratt has turned over a night into a household name all thanks to marvel and his charm and likability before he served as a professional goof ball but i dont think that will be the case anymore he shows such a wide range switching from comedy into actionadventure or a quickwitted scoundrel zoe saldana has established herself a long time as the gotoaction actress and once she shows why she has earned that she can be sexy funny and kick ass all in one moment dave bautista is a real surprise here as the warrior taking thins way too literal and therefore his actions and dialogue end up as some of the funniest in the entire film bradley cooper has tried to make his voice unrecognisable as the rocket racoon and he has created not another cg animated character but a character from flesh blood and fur his cynical guntoting maniacal raccoon will surely end up as the fans favorite but as i have stated before all the characters get the same time to shine groot a sentient tree with a limited vocabulary is the most innocent of all of the members of the team james gunn had to abandon his dark humor and frankly a little weird for the mainstream audience but what is more than obvious is the enthusiasm that this film was made with in every shot you can see the filmmaker who finally got the budget to realize all his dreams and ideas and so he stuffs into this film all those shots and camera angles of his dreams are all here the film is therefore such an amazing ride which sucks you in for 2 hours and then spits you out and you will want to go and see it immediately its that kind of a movie this is the film that all the teenagers are going to be talking about when they are 30 years old in the same way the star wars generation talks about that experience today the whole marvel cinematic universe is a history in the making which i am sure will be talking about for a long time the choice is yours if you want to go and see heavy intense drama disguised as a summer blockbuster go see the dawn of the planet of the apes  but if you want a selfreferential lighthearted fun go see the guardians of the galaxy it is one of the best films you will be able to see this yearpositive,Sorry entire cast other than Heath Ledger. Heath blew this character out of this role. They could have called this movie The Joker. His role made me become a huge Batman fan. I already collect movies but I went in to high gear for the different covers of the movie especially when he was on cover. I have a framed picture of him where he is standing in the street when he thinks he finally caught Batman. The poster has his and Christian Bales facsimile autographs. Im still searching for more different covers. Jack Nicholson is one of the greatest actors but sorry Mr. Jack Nicholson Heath made you look like a novice actor I highly recommend this movie. Has a great story great acting great directing but out this world acting from Heath Ledger. He is a actor that will be missedpositive,Some scenes that totally worth it to watch this movie over and over. the scene of the blood with the H when Mia is OD when Travolta and Mia are talking about a relationship and then started to dance it is just amazing how Quentin Tarantino could reach that level of movie one of the biggest movies of all times with i think Reservoir Dogs. I could recommend this film to almost everybody and i think everyone could fall in love with this movie. In the other hand the soundtrack is amazing i love it all especially those sad songs like Lonesome Town If love was a red dress. And the way the actors get into the character is very coolpositive,Some people are a bit hesitant to watch this movie due to the length of it and the tendency for the first movie to drag on a bit but even if you found the first 2 movies to be a bit boring for your taste you should by no means hesitate to watch this movie. The Return of the King is the most beautifully made movie every piece of the movie from the story to the action to the visual effects to the acting is just absolutely stunning. I have personally been looking for movies that can provide the same experience that this movie provides and there is clearly no match. The movie concludes the Lord of the Rings series showing everyones final push to end the reign of Sauron. The movie starts off with the story of how Gollum came to be which if you ask me has been long overdue but a great addition. The movie then continues to show the struggle Frodo is having bearing the influence of the ring and Sam continues to show his support for Frodo despite Gollums attempts to undermine Sam and trick Frodo. The rest of the cast find out that Sauron has plans to destroy Gondor and each contribute a role to stop Saurons army. The movie continues to drag you to the edge of your seat when i first saw it I wished that the movie wouldnt end but when it did it left a satisfying bittersweet feeling for those who followed Frodo from the Shire in the beginning. If you havent watched it put it on your list you wont regret it.positive,So this movie contains the best acting roles in the respective careers of John Travolta Samluel Jackson Uma Thurman and Bruce Willis On top of that and maybe in support of that it has the best dialog ever seen in a movie What more do people want This is a masterpiece in a totally different category than anything Tarrantino released before or after And people who dont like excessive violence more than 10000 people are shot to death each year in the states So really open your eyes it is not like this comes from nothing This movie is completely realistic in that aspectpositive,so there are basically 3 cinderella films now that will be forever referenced the original animated cinderella ever after and this live action cinderella i wasnt a fan of the original animated film when i saw it as a grade school kid but i really enjoyed ever after when i saw it as a college student now as a grumpy middle aged man i was reluctant to see another retelling of this classic story but my wife really wanted to see it so i gave it a shot glad that i did because i believe this cinderella is the best of them all this film does an excellent job of blending the realism of ever after with the fantasymagic from the animated film it also truly excels in showing you the depth of the relationships between cinderella and her parents and the prince with his father  even thought the onscreen time between the parents and kids is limited lily james as cinderella does an excellent job of showing frustration while maintaining her promise to mom  to be kind to others in other words she showed her humanity and wasnt just some sort of animated caricature its a shame movies like this dont often win best picture or best actoractress because the acting is that good in this film  all the way around go see it but bring some tissues with youpositive,so the movie was shot in 12 years thats hell of a record and its the first thing that makes this movie special the actors and actresses are actually growing up on scene the movie is a slow and soft piece of music with really no climax and all but every moment of it can be enjoyed profoundly there are lots of rooms for deep life lessons that you can absorb from the life of a young artistic kinda weird boy and everyone around him it feels like human kind is still on the way of figuring out the meaning of life this movie wont answer the question you can never answer the question but somewhere in this movie hidden around the corners you see the slightest clues of what life means what you want to do with it how to know who you want to be i wouldnt be surprised if this movie gets the oscar in 2 weeks despite many bad ratings going on around it its a movie that takes patience and experience to truly understand and feel forpositive,So good movie The Dark Knight in my opinion was the most remarkable action movie I have ever seen. The storyline action scenes make-up and actors make the movie feel like its not a movie at all. Its real life. The storyline is creative and memorable. The beginning has a great hook and makes you suspicious. At first I found this movie to be kind of scary and dark only because Im deathly afraid of clowns. But as the movie progressed I began to fall in love with it. The action scenes in this movie are so fantastic theres no word to describe it. The Joker constantly comes up with new games and adventures. My favorite scene was when the Joker was driving the truck and Batman flipped it over. I have never seen anything like thatpositive,Since the 90s came to a close Ive been considering what the best films of the last decade were. The more I think about it the more I become convinced that Pulp Fiction will be seen as a milestone in American filmmaking. For one it is simply an incredible film in its own right. Wonderfully drawn characters an incredibly compelling non-linear storyline and dialogue that shaped popular culture. From a historical perspective however it also represents a lot. It represents the emergence of independent films. Before Pulp Fiction independent films were a rarity for the Academy Awards and now at least one best picture slot is guaranteed for them. It also virtually created the careers of John Travolta now one of the top box office draws Sam Jackson and Quentin Tarantino. But most importantly it raised the bar in so many ways. The way it told the story that gags it used to get laughs and thrills at the same time and every other element of the film are now the standard that every other movie should be held to. An incredible film and an incredibly important one as well.  the characters the dialogue the music the colors the crazy plot. I wish Tarantinos follow-up to Pulp Fiction had also been an ensemble piece but my guess is that he wanted to avoid being pegged as a certain kind of storyteller. In my book hes only one kind of storyteller: a great one. Outside of Short Cuts this is the best film Ive ever seen. 10 stars. positive,Simply put you will never see a more perfect piece of non-linear narrative as one that invented this sub-genre Tarantino perfects this style with a mix of sublime acting perfect dissections of story plots I am positive I will never see a film as good as this The film offers a combination of perfect set pieces with memorable quotes most notably Say what again and memorable characters such as the Jules Winnfield and Vincent Vega duo the complex story of the suitcase is depicted in a way that can be followed and understood and the Hitchcock-inspired cameo by Tarantino is pitch perfect and adds a perfect depth to the character development of each plot in the filmpositive,similar to at least one of my fellow reviewers this is my first review if it happens to be my last as well i wouldnt mind this movie warrants a review the night before seeing interstellar i had watched stanley kubricks 2001 a space odyssey which may have been the best movie of its decadecentury as well i was blown away by the beauty and grandeur of kubricks masterpiece and i was worried that seeing it so soon before interstellar would lead me to great disappointment in nolans film fortunately this is not the case interstellar lived up to kubricks odyssey and will be one of my favorite movies of all time nolans movie certainly didnt surpass odyssey the two occupy a very different space no pun intended in my mind and in the annals of cinema i can say with confidence that the two of these movies have illustrated the glory of what can be achieved in a scifi film and they cause all others to pale in comparison even the recently released and acclaimed gravity has no such weight compared to these two masterpieces another great pun without spoiling any of the film i would like to discuss some details that impressed me the  is phenomenal the acting is powerful and the special effects are superb but perhaps my favorite aspect of the movie are the apparent nods to kubricks odyssey which made the dualexperience even more significant certain elements of the film reminded me of kubricks jupiter and beyond the infinite sequence the mysterious monoliths even the legendary hal9000 even with these slight similarities so much of the movie was different and in enough ways bolder such that interstellar feels incredibly fresh and original christopher nolan cowrote and directed this film which only further solidifies his status as one of the greatest directors of our generation even with his hardtomatch lineup of prior successes this movie is a phenomenal standout the runtime felt very appropriate and just like odyssey i was pleased with how many things were addressed after what seemed like logical stopping points please treat yourself to a theater experience of interstellar if you love scifi if you love the realities of space and astronomy even if you only love great film making you will love this moviepositive,Sheer brilliance from start to finish. The perfect end to THE perfect trilogy. Absolutely Mindblowing. Go see it.positive,Shawshank Redemption is without doubt one of the best films ever made and definitely the best film of 1994. Yes it is better than Lion King and I really like that too. It is not only enthralling but powerful and moving too. I will confess that I didnt understand it when I first saw it as a lot happens in the film and I have now seen it three times. I seriously hope that those who ignored the film when it was first released now recognise it as a great film as it really is. The dialogue was extremely well-written with lines that really stick in your mind. The cinematography and music are both gorgeous and the prison itself is like a character that dominates the film. In the script there are some true elements of Stephen King Now I admit I am not a huge king fan and usually dont like coarse language in books. But in his books like It which is very good I have accepted the language represents brutality and rebellion shown perfectly in the film with the battle of acceptance I suppose between the inmates and the superiorslike the scene with the warden yelling coarse language at the new inmates lined up in a row at the beginning.The acting was exceptional. I am not hugely familiar with Tim Robbins but he did a great job in a very demanding role. The best performance however comes from Morgan Freeman as Red who was seriously robbed of that Oscar that he lost to Tom Hanks for Forrest Gump. Freeman reminds me very strongly or his style of acting does remind me of that of Sean Connery suave yet very charismatic. Acting isnt just about your vocal range its about depth which was what Freeman certainly had. In short Freeman was brilliant in what could be his best performance. The scene where the inmates are listening to the Mozart aria over the speakers was a beautiful profound moment and I actually cried in Brooks death scene. Very rarely do King adaptations translate-to screen well because of the large scale of the authors books with the exception of this and the Shining. Some like It and Dreamcatcher are genuinely memorable but have a number of flaws that prevent them from being classed as outstanding. And some like Thinner and Tommyknockers that border on unwatchable. In conclusion Shawshank is a brilliant film that is worthy of the credit it has been denied for so-long. 10/10 of course. Bethany Cox.positive,Shawshank Redemption is without a doubt the most uplifting and touching film I have ever seen. It is the only movie Ive seen that has made tears of happiness come to my eyes. I would and do recommend this film to anyone and everyone.positive,Shawshank redemption is probably one of the greatest movies out there hands down. Its a story about a banker named Andy Dufresne who is sentenced to life in prison for killing his wife and her secret lover.At first for Andy it seems that life has taken a toll for the worst while he goes through the first initial weeks in Shawshank.Fortunately he befriends a group of the inmates over the course of his time there. Mainly a character named Red who has some push on things that go down in the prison. Red and Andy learn a lot of lessons from each other and become really great friends over their course of time at Shawshank. The dialogue in this movie is not only enticing but also has a bit of comic relief here and there. To me this movie mainly revolves not only the character development of Andy as a man sent to jail for life but mainly about the human condition and what it is like to no longer be a free man. Andys most important lesson that he learns in Shawshank is that while they can take virtually everything away from you including your pride and your dignity they can never take your Hope.positive,Shawshank Redemption is a very moving story about hope and the power of friendship. The cast is first rate with everyone giving a great performance. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman carry the movie but Bob Gunton and Clancy Brown are perfect as the Warden Norton and prison guard captain Hadley respectively. And James Whitmores portrayal of an elderly inmate Brooks is moving. The screenplay gives almost every actor at least one or more memorable lines through out the film. As well as a very surprising twist near the end that almost knocked me out of my chair. If you have not seen this movie rent it or better yet buy it. As I bet youll want to see this one more than once.positive,Shawshank Redemption gives the feel of a strong firm and amazing story that can move people while sitting down to watch it. The characters are memorable. Morgan Freeman as Red will always be in my head. Tim Robbins and Any Dufrense is amazing as well. Shawshank gives the audience a taste of a perfect movie. Movies like this dont come often. Movies come with strong stories but acting and flow of this story can mess it up. Shawshank doesnt disappoint. The acting is superb and the flow of the story is unforgettable. Based on the Stephen King novel Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption Id say this is one of the movies where the film triumphs over the novel. The film also brings a sense of humor which is a very good tool for films like these because if everything is serious its very possible that it might be killed. Well people have their own opinion. One scene amazes me and probably is one of my favorite scenes in the film is when the prisoners are watching Gilda and theyre all waiting for Rita Hayworth to do the thing with her hair. It still makes me laugh and pleased with the acting and reactions of the prisoner and the beauty of Rita Hayworth herself. Shawshank Redemption is a one-of-a-kind film where stories come in and the film enlarges the story and puts it into a whole new level. The excellent acting and a great adapted screenplay makes this movie one of the greatest films ever in history.  you get hooked in their mindless conversations and invest in their characters. The soundtrack will make you bob your head throughout the whole film and bobbing it hours after youve seen it. Its safe to say it is brilliant and really suits the film perfectly and when listened to sounds like it was perfectly made for a specific scene in the film. This film Quentin Tarintino on the map as one of the directors to see because of the jazzy cool vibe his films have. The directing is good with great uses of one shots and experimenting with transitions and angles such as the angle in which John Travolta and Samuel L. Jackson get their guns from the car boot. But the main star of the film is the writing. The writing is genius and flawlessly executed by the actors. You will be quoting this film a couple of years after you see it. If you pick any line from this film it will probably be a good one. Basically this film is a masterpiece and defined a genre that many writers will try to do. positive,Shawshank Redemption First time when I heard this name I had no idea what Shawshank is all about. I must accept the fact that I was not fascinated by its name but luckily I managed to see this movie. This movie is awesome it will fill you with hope when you start loosing hope at some point of time in your life. Thats the power of this movie. I have seen this movie maximum number of times as I have not seen others. Story goes this way: A man who was wrongly convicted murder of his wife and her lover. He got two life sentences back to back. He felt that he might not be proved good husband but he was not a murderer so he started planning to dig the tunnel to be free from this. The way he dig the tunnel and the person who helped him in his project was the crux of this movie. So it was his hope that was kept deep inside his heart that provide such a power to escape from the Shawshank. Please rent the DVD and watch it. you will surely find it most amazing movie as you have ever witness.positive,Shawshank Redemption based on a short story by Stephen King is about a man named Andy who is sent to jail after being convicted of killing his wife and lover He adapts to jail and is planning something big - all through the film clues are given as to what he is doing as he takes advantage of certain privileges he has. He makes friends with people in jail and goes through his daily life. Hope is all he can hold on to count on and rely on. Through years he figures a way to end all of it. The story fallows himself and friends as they try to rid themselves of an underlying feeling - a feeling of always being trapped. They hated the walls of the jail. Theyve grown used to them. And they love them. But not Andy. Everything about this movie is amazing. Screenplay cinematographyacting production... its simply one of the best films off all time.positive,Shawshank redemption at first wont strike you as a great moviewhen u look at the castexcept Morgan and other things but believe me its the best the story and the cast simply overwhelms you its such a great film that one would want to watch it again and again. The movie gives a feel that not many movies can give. it gives you sense of contempt that you had taken the right choice in seeing this film. Well it was released when i was very young i could find time to see it only now. and i still feel i should have seen this movie long before ITS WORTH EVERY SECOND GUYS Dont Miss It ITS THE BEST  but the most important fact is that LOTR is not only an adventure: it is a great lifes metaphor and the end of this trilogy complete the sense of life that Tolkien want to tell us: never stop searching for new experience never think of having arrived there is always something you can discover and it can be both good and evil. The last image of the film when Gandalf the elves and frodo are leaving the middle-earth is the perfect conclusion of the greatest and the most epic saga of all time. positive,Seriously This was one of the greatest films I have ever seen. Plain and simple. Im not saying it did not have some silly stupid stuff in it that I could have done without but overall what a movie Ledgers Joker will never be topped. Every scene in the movie that did not have Joker in it I was sitting there going whens the joker coming back. I just simply could not get enough of the character. He was so deep and so true to form. I could not have asked for anything more from Ledgers performance. I would have rathered the movie have been rated R and seen a little more gore because I think thats the only thing the Joker was not able to display was his cruelty. But still a fantastic performance. Oscar worthy I dont know but its got to be the closest any Comic book performance has gotten to being Oscar worthy. Most of my guesses at the plot line were right on. Bale can over act a bit at times. But none of it matters. Ledger steals the movie and everything else takes a back seat to his performance.positive,Seriously if ever theres a film that people should be forced to watch its this. The acting in it is truly perfect the storyline in very very well written and the ending is one of the cleverest and most misleading endings I have ever witnessed. This film can and will be enjoyed by people of all ages relatively - check parents guide for suitability and will keep you in suspense for the full duration. Unlike in most other Hollywood films the twists in the storyline are very well executed and it is in no ways cheesy or cheap. Morgan Freeman gives the performance of his life without making his fellow actors over-act. The Shawshank Redemption blows every other prison dramas out of the water. See it at all costs.positive,seeing this movie twice i will admit that this movie does contain plot holes but overall it is still a highly enjoyable thriller with what i believe is some top notch acting both ben affleck and rosamund pike are great in their roles and both oscar worthy even tyler perry does a surprisingly great job in his role the  is a highlight worth mentioning in this review because it is amazing trent reznor and atticus ross did a superb job the soundtrack is amazing and should win an oscar because it is hauntingly powerful i recommend this movie for anyone willing to have a good time trying to witness a good thriller and great actingpositive,Seeing Shawshank as the IMDb #1 did not surprise me a bit. This movie has the heart & soul to be a favourite for a long time to come. I like the reality of the unfairness of the whole situation. There is no glossing over the painful stuff. He was innocent but still jailed. He did get raped. His chance DID get wiped out to have his story confirmed. What a waste. I read some people calling this a feel-good story. Perhaps in the end but other than the relief of freedom there wasnt much to feel good about. Talk about a hard-fought battle. And it isnt even over... His life is better than it was but still sucks considering everything he lost considering he can never go back considering he is always a fugitive... If youre feeling bummed out about your own life this is a good movie to watch to realize that things could always be worse.positive,See the movie... It rocks Its the best of the 3 and perfectly completes the trilogy. Ill be seeing it again and again and again. After seeing it go back and watch the extended additions of 1 and 2. Everything I saw in 1 and 2 makes total sense. Cool foreshadowing of people and events too. I can hardly wait for the directors cut to come out  everyone is in dynamic form though it is perhaps Jackson as the bible-bashing smart-mouthed hit-man Jules who leaves the most lasting impression. His career post- Pulp Fiction has been quite simply a twenty year success story. Theres an abundance of terrific individual scenes too Š—– the adrenalin- shot-to-the-heart sequence in which Vincent saves Mia from a drug overdose  the clean-up of Marvins corpse after being accidentally shot by Vincent  Christopher Walkens unforgettable single-scene cameo in which he describes the history of Butchs gold watchŠ—_ It would take too long to list all of the films many wonderful vignettes  lets just say it overflows with great moments. Different viewers will take from it their own particular favourites. If Reservoir Dogs hailed the emergence of a fiery raw talent in Tarantino Pulp Fiction marks a quantum leap in style control and story-telling bravado. It remains a brilliant film only Tarantinos second behind the cameras but still a strong contender for his best. positive,Samuel Jackson John Travolta  Bruce Willis - Can this get any better  The dialogues are exquisite You will love the Ezekiel 25:17 and will learn and say it every time u watch it  I can go on and on writing a review But all i really wanna say is PLEASE WATCH If youve watched it already then WATCH IT AGAIN At any point of time if you find it confusing Dont worry that would have happened to everyone  Towards the end Everything will be uncovered and there will be no questions unanswered left I can guarantee that anyone after watching this movie will not be disappointed and will become a Quentin Tarantino fan for Life Personally loved the soundtracks Cheerspositive,richard linklaters boyhood might be one of my favorite movies of all time it works because it shares mundane and even quotidian details about everyday life in a way that enabled me to relate and reflect on how things have worked out in my own life as a boy boyfriend man husband and father scene after scene i was moved by familiar things depicted in the story songs neighborhoods classrooms teachers public placesfood and even conversations to me the genius of linklaters 12year filming timeline is that he was able to show how peoples personalities remain fixed over time and yet life experiences operate to deepen and redeem our characters those who come to this film looking for abstraction or arthouse pretentiousness preciousness? will be disappointed but if you watch this movie with attention to how your heart is reacting to characters and their development in each scene you will be strangely warmed maybe even encouraged and certainly challenged by the simple questions life poses that often take years to answerpositive,richard linklaters boyhood is the sort of movie i live for seldom does a movie significantly change the landscape of filmmaking in a way so grand in scope yet so simple in delivery boyhood is a movie that crafts the most realistic representation of life into the boundaries of a 165 minute film and it could have focused on just one aspect of life but instead it perfectly encapsulates the idea of what it is like to grow up the idea that everyone is familiar with and will most certainly relate to the movie is not just about one thing alone but in the end it is it is about life itself we follow young mason played extraordinarily by ellar coltrane from the age of 6 to his first day of college we do not have different actors playing the same characters each of the actors were filmed annually for 12 years there are no prosthetics no extensive makeup and no body doubles i could try to give you a brief summary of all the major things he experiences in his life but that would be taking away the magic of watching his life unfold before your very eyes almost every moment that you have experienced in life  no matter how mundane or unimportant  is up on screen for you to relive from times when your parent told you to actually talk about your day instead of saying it was ok to the talk to graduating college and leaving home to falling in love and falling out of love to that first day of school to making friends and losing friends and every moment you think you have forgotten boyhood has all these moments that might have seemed unimportant to us at the time but they appear as milestones in the life of mason coltrane is fantastic even at the age of 6 he is great his life is utterly absorbing we became entranced by his life even if nothing huge is happening we see him grow up in front of our eyes there really is no equal to this type of experience except maybe if you were to marathon all of the harry potter films he is continuously changing before our eyes his hair grows and is cut off he gets taller and gets piercings but although his appearance changes he remains the same type of person playing the older sister and getting far less recognition than coltrane is linklaters own daughter lorelei from early childhood to her teenage years she is the one who bugs her brother but also accompanies him along for the ride just like any good sibling would do his mother in the film played exceptionally by patricia arquette is a woman who is struggling to raise her two kids on her own she is flawed though she has a hot temper and continuously picks the wrong man but she is what a mother should be thoughtful and caring she cares for her children and does whatever she can do to make it by and let them live a happy life his dad played by ethan hawke in one of his best roles though caring as he may be is divorced from their mother for obvious reasons he is always fun spontaneous and wants nothing but to be a family again he is always there for his weekends and always tries to show his kids the best time possible the film is set to what is essentially a greatest hits of the 2000s linklater who is famous for his soundtracks uses music in this movie as an indicator of the time from early scenes featuring brittney spears and coldplay to final moments with foster the people and arcade fire the movie contains an amazing soundtrack as someone who only just recently passed the age at the end of the film there are so many references to my childhood that makes this film hit even harder than it does for those older it is imbued with memories of watching dragonball z after school while laying on the floor playing halo with friends anxiously anticipating the next harry potter book talking about the possibilities of another star wars and many more anybody who has just started college should see this movie to see their childhoods flash before their eyes boyhood is basically shot in a series of episodes with each year or so being a new chapter in the story but there are no dramatic cuts to future scenes there are no subtitles that explain what year it is the years bleed together like they do for anyone we do not live life as a series of chapters we live at it as one long story not quite knowing where one chapter begins and the other ends and we are only given a brief glimpse in the life of a boy growing up by the end of the film i wanted to see more i wanted to see what he would do in his life who he would marry what his kids would be like i wanted to watch all the way up until his final moments but sadly that is an impossibility and we are left to wonder where life takes him twelve years ago making this movie must have seemed like a huge gamble there were so many things that could go wrong in 12 years someone could have died or quit funding could have fallen through or linklater could have realized what he was making was complete garbage there are a million reasons why this movie could not have worked out it somehow worked out perfectly and we are left with a truly cinematic masterpiece a movie that will go down as one of the best of the year maybe even of our generation it is a truly and wholly unique and magical experience it is a perfect movie ragingfilmcompositive,richard linklaters boyhood is the sort of movie i live for seldom does a movie significantly change the landscape of filmmaking in a way so grand in scope yet so simple in delivery boyhood is a movie that crafts the most realistic representation of life into the boundaries of a 165 minute film and it could have focused on just one aspect of life but instead it perfectly encapsulates the idea of what it is like to grow up the idea that everyone is familiar with and will most certainly relate to the movie is not just about one thing alone but in the end it is it is about life itself we follow young mason played extraordinarily by ellar coltrane from the age of 6 to his first day of college we do not have different actors playing the same characters each of the actors were filmed annually for 12 years there are no prosthetics no extensive makeup and no body doubles i could try to give you a brief summary of all the major things he experiences in his life but that would be taking away the magic of watching his life unfold before your very eyes almost every moment that you have experienced in lifeã no matter how mundane or unimportantã is up on screen for you to relive from times when your parent told you to actually talk about your day instead of saying it was ok to the talk to graduating college and leaving home to falling in love and falling out of love to that first day of school to making friends and losing friends and every moment you think you have forgotten boyhood has all these moments that might have seemed unimportant to us at the time but they appear as milestones in the life of mason coltrane is fantastic even at the age of 6 he is great his life is utterly absorbing we became entranced by his life even if nothing huge is happening we see him grow up in front of our eyes there really is no equal to this type of experienceãexcept maybe if you were to marathon all of the harry potter films he is continuously changing before our eyes his hair grows and is cut off he gets taller and gets piercings but although his appearance changes he remains the same type of person playing the older sister and getting far less recognition than coltrane is linklaters own daughter lorelei from early childhood to her teenage years she is the one who bugs her brother but also accompanies him along for the ride just like any good sibling would do his mother in the film played exceptionally by patricia arquette is a woman who is struggling to raise her two kids on her own she is flawed though she has a hot temper and continuously picks the wrong man but she is what a mother should be thoughtful and caring she cares for her children and does whatever she can do to make it by and let them live a happy life his dad played by ethan hawke in one of his best roles though caring as he may be is divorced from their mother for obvious reasons he is always fun spontaneous and wants nothing but to be a family again he is always there for his weekends and always tries to show his kids the best time possible the film is set to what is essentially a greatest hits of the 2000s linklater who is famous for his soundtracks uses music in this movie as an indicator of the time from early scenes featuring brittney spears and coldplay to final moments with foster the people and arcade fire the movie contains an amazing soundtrack as someone who only just recently passed the age at the end of the film there are so many references to my childhood that makes this film hit even harder than it does for those older it is imbued with memories of watching dragonball z after school while laying on the floor playing halo with friends anxiously anticipating the next harry potter book talking about the possibilities of another star wars and many more anybody who has just started college should see this movie to see their childhoods flash before their eyes boyhood is basically shot in a series of episodes with each year or so being a new chapter in the story but there are no dramatic cuts to future scenes there are no subtitles that explain what year it is the years bleed together like they do for anyone we do not live life as a series of chapters we live at it as one long story not quite knowing where one chapter begins and the other ends and we are only given a brief glimpse in the life of a boy growing up by the end of the film i wanted to see more i wanted to see what he would do in his life who he would marry what his kids would be like i wanted to watch all the way up until his final moments but sadly that is an impossibility and we are left to wonder where life takes him twelve years ago making this movie must

life epic movie will be remembered forever a lot of hearts got touched because in a way we felt what we couldnt feel again childhood and to see all difficulties in life was worth going through what mason been through is what millions others went through just seeing time fly by and things change for better or worse or even the same life is stages every stage is different husbandsfriendseven

boyhood is a roller coaster of emotion and sentiment seen through the eyes of a young boy over a span of 12 years the film has a very intimate feeling that i have never experienced watching any other film it was hard not to relate to mason through out some parts of his life goodbyesfirst loveslost friendships and a constant struggle with the world around you boyhood is a once in a lifetime film a movie where time is real a film where we get to watch these characters grow making them feel like they are a part of our own world certain people dont seem to praise boyhood as much as other reviewers and critics have probably because there are no intense hollywood esque moments where a character gets an epiphany from the heavens everything in boyhood feels very real and personal making it a very intimate and beautiful to watch a journey like nothing ever seen in filmpositive,Return Of The King is one of those rare movies that I have so much trouble coming up with a decent review because Im absolutely speechless. Return Of The King is also one of the rare films that actually surpass the hype. I have rarely been so emotionally exhausted in my life time. Its a known fact that I dislike Fellowship but adored Two Towers so I had high hopes for this one. Return Of The King has so much action going on its honestly hard to keep up. There is something going on at every turn with unbearable suspense. All the characters are even better this time around especially Frodo. I was amazed at some of the selfishness he had this time around instead of the goody two shoes routine he usually did it made for some really gripping suspense. The performances are absolutely incredible for the most part everybody has truly grown up. I avoided the Lord Of The Ring series for so many years because of the constant over hype people gave the series. Well Its nice to be proved wrong once in a while and Return Of The King especially shut me up but quick. Bottom Line. Return Of The King is a masterpiece plain and simple. Its one of the best movies in the history of cinema and I thank Peter Jackson for giving me 3 or so hours of wonderful cinema. The Two Towers is a masterpiece itself but it does not compare to the brilliance of this one. Even if you arent a fan of the genre this is still an absolute must watch. 10/10positive,Respect to the art of cinema by Mr Tarantino The Cast comes out of Muthology and the Soundtrack out of Heaven Once in a lifetime there is a combination of this fact Be well if you saw that movie in a life changing period The powerful overdose of xtreme i dont care - life is now scenes of the film in addition to almost ingenious screenplay comes to fit the perfect choices of music So Cast Full Text Full Music Full And here comes Mr Quentin Lets play Cut Move Cut Move Cut Cut Move Time is only a line yeah watch me directing All the other stuff I dont remember Now its like a fairytale I watch it every Monday before sleeping Mondays are tough days Be wellpositive,recently i had one of the greatest cinematic experiences of my life i delved into richard linklaters wonderfully organic and profoundly moving masterpiece boyhood for those of you unfamiliar with the film boyhood chronicles the life of mason played by ellar coltrane as he wades through childhood from ages seven to eighteen sounds like the plot to a movie weve seen a few thousand times right?

This is a movie that from start to finish keeps you engaged like no other film. When it concludes you wonder how a 2 hour plus movie can go by so quickly. No bathroom breaks or snack breaks during this movie whether its the first time watching it or your tenth. Just sat down and watched it again 2 nights ago with my daughter 12. She too never moved from the couch and loved the film. This film will hold up to the test of time because its simple: great writing great acting great directing and watchable over and over.positive,Read this loud and clear: Pulp Fiction will never ever happen again The impact the delivery the timing and the overall stamp it has placed in cinema history can never be duplicated See there are bad movies good movies great movies and trailblazers The trailblazers are films that jump-start a movement revolutionize the industry change the landscape of motion pictures and delivers an impact whether immediate Star Wars or down the road Fight Club that never exits the general consensus Wizard of Oz 2001: A Space Odyssey Psycho Jaws Star Wars Raiders of the Lost Ark The Graduate and Goodfellas are all examples of films that are trailblazers None of these films have any contemporaries they are their own category and all films of similar genres become compared to them Pulp Fiction is a 90s indie trailblazer that absolutely altered the entire culture of movies by crafting what at the time was easily one of the most jarring unexpected stylish and wholesome cinematic experiences ever witnessed Pulp Fiction was a low-budget flick with such high aspirations that 1994 didnt know how to handle it The soundtrack among the best in film history the unexpected blend of violence drugs and realistic dialogue the surprises the utter lack of chronological order the style the tone and the overall look of Pulp Fiction made it stand out not just among the films of the 90s but everything preceding it It talks like a Scorsese movie moves like a 1950s Italian neorealism flick paces like a spaghetti western and breathes like an underground comic book come to life Pulp Fiction is tasty cinematic soup Pulp Fiction knew it was cool before the viewer did Pulp Fiction knew that its audience was going to put up with the 150 minutes of dialogue because the characters were so strong the story lines were unique and there were so many details explained and unexplained that it required multiple viewings to catch it all and jump-started urban legends and mysteries that remain unsolved to this day It was a movie that created its own culture and fanbase that would follow madman Quinten Tarantino for the entirety of his career---through the bad Death Proof and the good Django Unchained Everything in this movie works The cast was downright phenomenal and nearly miraculous considering the budget Bruce Willis Samuel L Jackson John Travolta AND Christopher Walken in one movie The dialogue was sharp witty brutal and breathes life into each character you see within the pulp-influenced saga The directing by Tarantino was practically flawless as he makes transforms the camera into a curious witness by mixing in a barrage of close-ups long shots and spastic movement that never feels like its framing a shot but more so just following the story along where ever the action was going This movie literally has it all: sex violence drugs rock n roll dancing singing crime morality issues romance revenge monologues potential miracles shootouts dark humor dozens of film references and even a couple glimpses of the California underworld that most people would rather not know about And all this was accomplished without a Hollywood budget There was a slight sense of amateurism that gave the movie an edge like a black sheep in the meadows of the film industry This would inspire an entire wave of budding ambitious and hopeful filmmakers that also had their stories to tell and didnt want to cater to the typical Hollywood output or abide by its rules Pulp Fiction is a B-Movie setup executed like an underground masterpiece from the dialogue-heavy start to the sudden finish You cant duplicate this I couldnt duplicate this Tarantino could never duplicate this Pulp Fiction is one of the greatest films ever made and a perfect storm of innovative filmmaking that lifted 1994 into one of the best years of film that has ever existed---and launched an entire era of indie filmmaking that still has its effects on the industry today Pulp Fiction is as absolutely cool as its getspositive,Rather than dwell on any bad points - are their any I must have watched & tremendously enjoyed this film 6x in the last year and probably the equivalent every year since it was released Tarantinos mark on all his films is evident - and yes its obvious hes using his childhood experience or dreams in his fantastic ability to make stunning films & to top it off the 360 filming of this piece is a pleasure to behold Never ever get bored of the quality this artist delivers nor do my 16 & 18 year old sons One of the best Directors & Writers everpositive,Quite simply Tarantinos best and arguably the best film ever: Pulp Fiction With a star-studded cast and non-linear storyline to back up complex characters and realistic dialogue this film cannot easily be beat I have seen this film probably about 10 times and every time I learn something new: what pack of cigarettes Butch smokes what the hell a palooka is the outrageous and sadistic ways of Senorita Villalobos etc This film is enticing at every turn with a soundtrack to die for and the goddess of editing Ms Sally Menke it is simply amazing Also the fact this epic was made for only 10 million dollars What Film with 30 times that budget have trouble sticking in the same league as this piece What is all comes down to is the fact that Quentin Tarantino is the motion picture craftsmen of his generation and the best of the past 25 years Sorry Martypositive,Quite simply I think that this may be the greatest movie of all time. Everyone had such high expectations and it didnt let them down. It delivered hardcore. Give Sean Austin the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor NOWpositive,Quite simply Dark Knight is the best superhero movie ever made ok KickAss is the only competitor but strictly speaking it isnt a proper superhero movie so lets forget about that. Batman is tough Batman is loved Batman is weak Batman is hated. Batman has human characteristics. Batmans enemies have human characteristics. This is the first and main reason Dark Knight succeeds. It isnt just a superhero movie. Its also a study of character of good and of dark and of perception of society. I mean it does this so well I sometimes think the superhero content is just a scapegoat for the deeper thought in the movie even though I know at the same that its not. Secondly Batman doesnt do anything too unbelievable. Look at Superman hes flying. Look at Spiderman hes got webs coming out of his palms. Look at the Hulk he can get MASSIVE when he is angry. Thats all cool and entertaining but Batman is imo the superhero whom we can connect to the closest because he doesnt have these abilities about him which are soooo unrealistic. So both his inner and outer character are human like which makes the movie so much more enjoyable. The action The action in Dark Knight is amazing Batmans car is amazing The special effects are amazing It is a phenomenal piece of work crafting a movie where it looks and feels fantastic I wont talk much about Heath Ledgers portrayal of the joker. Its definitely his best performance ever and what better time to have it just before his death peace be upon him. I hate a ball watching the guy act. Hes just created an insanely unique persona. I loved it Everything in Dark Knight works. Its got so much novelty to it. Its a rare piece of cinema where prima facie its for kids but ultimately adults will end up enjoying it much more. Dark Knight isnt for kids anyway they wont be able to comprehend the bigger picture in Dark Knight which is what makes this movie so special. Its cool Its original Its awesome I cant believe how it wasnt nominated for a Best Picture. Oscars were probably too stunned at how good a super hero movie could be. Did I mention I also love Gary Oldman the guy plays a different person in every movie I can never tell its himpositive,Quite possibly one of the best films ever made in terms of writing acting and pop culture reference. The dialogue is brilliant and intelligent. I definately dug it the most Bruce Willis and Christopher Walkens segment was hilarious in spite of the fact of delicate subject matter. I also enjoyed the that is a tasty burger segment.positive,Quentin TarantinoThat name is a guarantee for brilliant thrilling movies with excellent dialogues AND SO IS PULP FICTION Samuel L Jackson is the king as always But I also liked Ving Rames Harvey Keitel and Tim Roth Christopher Walken was great too despite of his very small partnot as small as that of Steve Buscemi Pulp fiction is fast thrilling funny I am running out of compliments  O yeah I voted a 10positive,Quentin Tarantinos Pulp Fiction not only is a fantastic achievement in film making it also conjured up such a different perspective of the potential of mainstream Hollywood film A complex tale of murder humor and odd characters suffused with pop-culture references sharp and witty dialog fantastic acting a rollicking soundtrack of multiple different genres and ultimately an intriguing and game-changing story line directed almost flawlessly There are faults as in every film scattered here and there but they are subtle and even with a scrutinizing eye do not remove you from the experience of sitting and feasting your eyes upon this masterpiece on all fronts There is very little else that can be said about this film as everyone and their mothers has seen it hopefully not together Bring out the gimp I envy those cave-dwellers who have yet to see it and I urge you to do so Right nowpositive,Quentin Tarantinos Pulp Fiction is the most stylish film ever made. The title and front cover says it allpositive,Quentin Tarantinos Pulp Fiction is a work of postmodern art Its unlike any film Ive seen before and because of that I commend it for not searching for a blueprint or a formula to tell its story Tarantino tells the story from pure originality and like many of his future films Pulp Fiction is told with a non-linear narrative making it hard to explain the plot Its better to just introduce the characters and go from there The story is about very different people whose lives intertwine with one another over the course of a few days The characters first introduced are Pumpkin Roth and Honey Bunny Plummer who are talking in a dinner with plans to conduct a heist We then cut to two detectives named Vincent Vega Travolta and Jules Winnfield Jackson who are trying to retrieve a briefcase they can bring to their boss Marsellus Wallace Rhames Wallace has his own chapter in the film as well Him and prizefighter Butch Coolidge Willis strike a deal where Butch accepts a large amount of money to throw an upcoming fight While Wallace is tied up in this deal Vega goes over to meet and take to dinner the lovely Mrs Mia Wallace Thurman A series of events happen causing dismay among Vega which lead to some very well-written and well-acted sequences Being that the film is conducted in a very nontraditional style Pulp Fiction is a task to follow sometimes My advice  watch it and just go along with it If you feel inclined to look up how it played out on the internet go ahead or if you want to give it a rewatch that is fine too Viewing multiple clips for a second time I think I finally understand it more but a lot of questions youll still be asking after repeated viewings One of the most famous questions is whats in the briefcase that is recovered by Vega and Winnfield in the early scenes of the film Im sure when writing the film Tarantino himself didnt know what he wanted to put in the briefcase Im also sure he didnt think it would blow up into such a debacle on the message boards and through word of mouth What truly makes Pulp Fiction worthwhile is the genius dialog Tarantino cranks out the best script possible combined with enough wit and violence to please the most demanding and picky action-film fan One moment the two are discussing why a Quarter Pounder With Cheese from McDonalds is called a Royale With Cheese in France Next they are threatening violence if a victim asks the question what again Why do I not condone constant swearing and gratuitous violence in other films but for some reason award a perfect  to a film that is made up of it Because Pulp Fiction shows how it should be done It depicts realistic situations handled intelligently and with wit and soul It doesnt utilize them for the purpose of being monotonous or dreary but to advance an already crafty storyline The character are under such stress it only makes sense that they are constantly shouting four letter words Is it necessary Not really But Pulp Fiction isnt just about swearing It proves that true cinema still exists and that even a story that appears choppy and inconsistent on paper can still produce one of the best films of the decade Starring: John Travolta Samuel L Jackson Uma Thurman Harvey Keitel Tim Roth Amanda Plummer Maria de Medeiros Ving Rhames Eric Stoltz Rosanna Arquette Christopher Walken Bruce Willis and

French names for American fast food products  Bruce Willis as a boxer out of a 1940s B-movie  and such other stalwarts as Harvey Keitel Tim Roth Christopher Walken Eric Stoltz Ving Rhames and Uma

giving their best and music is fantastic Personality goes a long waypositive,QUENTIN TARANTINO RULES And Pulp Fiction is his most fabolous masterpiece Everything seems perfect and nothing is left aside It has got it all Pulp fiction easely gets number 2 on my favourite movielist People that calls themselves movie lovers but who dont like Pulp Fictions can as well stop watching moviespositive,Quentin Tarantino is the Jerry Lee Lewis of cinema a pounding performer who doesnt care if he tears up the piano as long as everybody is rocking. His new movie Pulp Fiction is a comedy about blood guts violence strange sex drugs fixed fights dead body disposal leather freaks and a wristwatch that makes a dark journey down through the generations. Seeing this movie last May at the Cannes Film Festival I knew it was either one of the years best films or one of the worst. Tarantino is too gifted a filmmaker to make a boring movie but he could possibly make a bad one: Like Edward D. Wood Jr. proclaimed the Worst Director of All Time hes in love with every shot - intoxicated with the very act of making a movie. Its that very lack of caution and introspection that makes Pulp Fiction crackle like an ozone generator: Heres a director whos been let loose inside the toy store and wants to play all night.positive,Quentin Tarantino is one of the greatest directors of all time. It is not a coincidence therefore that Pulp Fiction one of his most well recognized and known movies is one of the best movies of all time. Between the eclectic and comedic plot and the supreme group of actors that Tarantino used for the movie it is inarguable otherwise. For many people for instance some of my friends who have watched Pulp Fiction the plot is a negative. These people have got to be Type As who require a structured and well planned plot with a more developed and organized background and character set. They usually think this because the movie simply picks up at different places and is not in chronological order. The movie also introduces characters to the audience without any name background or insight into the character. These two things can most easily be seen in the beginning and middle of the movie. In the beginning when the Honey-Bunny scene is introduced for the first time it is easy for the audience to be dumbfounded and confused as to what the movie is about and who the characters are. The audience may also be confused in the middle of the movie when Marsellus Wallace is talking to Butch. There are no obvious indications as to who the two men are. The audience has to draw from context clues that the black man is Marsellus Wallace and that Butch is a boxer who is supposed to go down for him. It is easy to see that this may irk somebody who has a Type A personality. To me however this is a very positive and refreshing aspect of Pulp Fiction. Movies are too predictable today. They present too many known and common variables. All of Quentin Tarantinos movies or at least most are unpredictable. This unpredictability is refreshing. The randomness especially in Pulp Fiction is positive new and makes watching the movie fun and exciting. Much of the randomness factor in Pulp Fiction comes from random little extras that mean nothing to the plot of the movie. An example of this is when Vince and Mia are on the date and Mia calls Vince a square. But rather than saying square she outlines a square with her fingers in the air and lines follow her fingers on the screen. Another random yet comedic part of the movie is when Butch comes home to his girlfriend Fabienne and she says she wants a pot belly. This is where the audience first learns that Fabienne is quite weird and oblivious. Besides these two scenes there are many other strange little jokes or bizarre piece of humor intertwined into the movie. An excellent example of this is when Butch learns that the watch he receives from his dead fathers comrade was kept inside both of their rectums. Of course the vocabulary Tarantino uses for these for these scenes is quite vulgar but the vulgarity adds to the hilarity factor. The actors are also part of what makes Pulp Fiction as good a movie as it is. Tarantino usually uses many of the same actors especially Uma Thurman and Christopher Walken. Thurman plays Mia and Walken plays a more minor role. Besides Thurman and Walken many acting greats including John Travolta Bruce Willis and Samuel L. Jackson take major roles. In my opinion Pulp Fiction is the best movie I have seen Bruce Willis play in as he does not play some cheesy clich’© character with clich’© lines like in all the Die Hard movies. John Travolta also plays his role very well as he also does not take himself too seriously. Samuel L. Jackson in many aspects is the funniest and best character of the movie. His violent rants and outbursts are hilariously awesome and challenge his famous Go the _____ to Sleep. Pulp Fiction also leaves the audience with questions. The biggest question is what is in the suitcase. All that is known about the contents of the suitcase is that they glow orange and that Marsellus Wallace is the owner and needs them back. The audience also gets to see that anybody looking at the contents freezes and stares when they see what is inside. When I saw the movie for the first time I thought that the content was gold bars which may explain the orange glow that hits characters faces when they opened up the suitcase. But after investigation on the internet unaware that the subject was of hot debate I learned that Tarantino wanted the suitcase to hold diamonds but used diamonds in another movie so he just did not show the contents at all. It is these small mysteries that add interest and debate over the quality of movies. Because of the actors hilarity and mystery in Pulp Fiction it can be considered one of the best movies of all time. Tarantino did not disappoint with this 1994 movie. He intrigued many with a more artist and abstract way of making plots and directing movies.positive,Quentin Tarantino has to be one of the best directors of the 90s and Pulp Fiction is without doubt one of the best films ever made This film also has one of the best casts ever assembled the list of big names is endless If you havent seen this film then you need to watch it as soon as you can you will not be disappointed How it won just one Oscar I will never know it defiantly deserved more in my opinion If I had to describe it in one word it would be Cool From Samuel L Jacksons speech to John Travolta and Uma Thurmans dance When all the story lines come together it is magnificent and it is one of the few films that deserves a 10 star ratingpositive,Quentin Tarantino has one the most brilliant minds ever Not only does he make great movies but he always finds a way to keep you interested in whatever it is that going on exception Jackie Brown which is a review Ill save for a day when I have time to complain about how awful it was So as I was saying Tarantino is a brilliant and I think the way he lays the story out in this particular movies couldnt have been any better He had the perfect cast to pull of what I believe to be the best movie of that particular year I honestly thought when I first saw this film that Samuel L Jackson and John Travolta were going to be a horrible match side by side but the scenes with those two are what made me love the movie so much Willis and Rhames scenes were great too the situation they were in was kinda effed up but none the less entertaining The only time I lost any interest in this movie was when Uma Thurman had her moment of glory but when she overdosed it kinda pulled me back into what was going on weird I know but back to my point the movie was great and I give it a 10/10 I know this isnt a great review but Im not good at this kind of stuff so bite mepositive,Quentin Tarantino at his best This movie is mostly dialogs but it is so well written that you never get bored And it has the best product placement ever Royal Cheese :P This movie is great and still to this day one of my all time favorite movies Amazing acting dialogues and screenplay Each character has their own story and they are all likable Characters and stories arent superifical they are in dept and likable It may not have a great message or anything but it is a great movie nonetheless Also it is great to see Bruce Willis trying to act in a great non action movie They should do a lot more movies togetherpositive,Pulp Fiction. Its the answer you give when a child comes running up to you and asks what is cinema. Its the definition you give to someone when they question cool style and most of all pure entertainment. From its pulp visuals to flawless direction superb screenplay to mesmerising characters its better than the best sex you will ever have. Endlessly quotable and watchable captivating making every turn more exciting than the last. More than a experience but a passage into life because if you aint a Bad Mother F****R then you aint sh*tpositive,Pulp Fiction Where do I even begin to review a film like Pulp Fiction Let me just start out by saying that I have never seen another film like Pulp Fiction This was my first Quentin Tarantino film and in my opinion none of his other films have even come close to this masterpiece One of the greatest things about this film and also something that sets it apart from most any other movie is that it revolves around the dialogue The conversations between characters in Pulp Fiction are unlike any conversations between characters that I have ever seen in a film because they are absurdly realistic This film is the most quotable movie I have ever seen to the point where the last scene of the film I know almost every line Usually if a film tries to revolve around the dialogue it ends up being really boring This is because not many directors can do dialogue the way that Quentin Tarantino does dialogue The acting in this movie is also incredible This is my favorite role that Samuel L Jackson has played Jules Winnfield and also my favorite role of John Travoltas Vincent Vega as well as my favorite role of Uma Thurman Mia Wallace and Tim Roth Ringo There is not one weak performance in Pulp Fiction Tarantinos non-linear non-story based masterpiece is the most unique film that I have ever seen It is entirely left up to your own interpretation Nothing in this film is explained for you You are free to think of it however you want and make up your own stories Once you see the film you will no doubt be left with questions such as What is in the briefcase one of the longest standing questions asked of a film People try to come up with the answer but the truth is that there is no answer The answer is whatever you want it to be Never before have I seen a film that leaves so much up to the viewers interpretation and does it so well If you do not see this movie you are missing out on one of the best movies ever made and possibly the most unique film that you will ever see This Quentin Tarantinos masterpiece by far Pulp Fiction obviously gets a 10 out of 10positive,Pulp Fiction turns a lot of people off at first with its violence and its nonlinear plot but on subsequent viewings the movie improves by leaps and bounds. Every time you watch it you will catch more nuances you will recognize the skill of craftsmanship that went into making this film. Im not even talking about Tarantino even though I feel this is his best. Watch how many details the actors put into their roles the small gestures and looks that make the dialogue sizzle. Samuel Jackson and Uma Thurman are obvious standouts and Tim Roth and Harvey Keitel are also quite good. Christopher Walken steals the show with the most memorable single-appearance role in recent history. So even if you didnt care for it the first time give it another try. And if you liked it the first time buy a copy and watch it until it wears out like mine just didpositive,Pulp Fiction truly changed my life The fragmented presentation of the movie in stories superb dialogue the fact that the settings and characters are just so cool and many other film-making touches makes this movie magnificent It made me realise actually how much I love movies The first aspect to take note of when you watch the movie will be when you see the cast At the time seeing John Travoltas name acting as the supposed leading role in the film saw the resurgence of his career and he acted brilliantly Its the one role he plays where on sometimes forgets its the famous John Travolta acting Enthusiasts of other Tarantino films will recognise Harvey Keitel Tim Roth from his other works and if one is really sharp Steve Buscemi and even Christopher Walken Samuel L Jackson was to show the world how good an actor he is in this movie Also amongst the cast names in the opening credits at the very end after about 12 names comes Bruce Willis Last undoubtedly not least A noticeable touch The script is of epic proportions Tarantino and Avary created stories which especially the last two can be appreciated in many ways with powerful significance Dialogue is superb throughout bringing both astute humour and reality to the picture The music chosen surely makes the soundtrack one of the best of all time I love and appreciate literally every shot in the movie There is only one line in the film I dont like When Rachel talks back to say Good night Rachel is the only part of the entire film I dont like and the line fits perfectly with the character I just hate the character The more you watch this film the more one gets out Ive seen it over 50 times and I get something new out of it almost every time From script interpretations to things one doesnt have a chance to see or hear the first time It was made so that it would be appreciated for the multiple viewer There is much more I could add but most has all been said before Ill end by saying seeing certain movies can bring great personal moments This movie can be seen as a great asset to the world of film In my opinion its the greatest ever madepositive,Pulp fiction the magnum opus of Quentin Tarantino is an absolute visual treat The exemplary usage of nonlinear story-telling will leave the viewers open mouthed Backed up by some very powerful performances by the cast the film has become a benchmark for all black comedy films The screenplay by Tarantino artistically narrates the incidents concerning a particularly interesting group of people The film is replete with iconic moments like the monologue perfectly delivered by Jules Winnfield Samuel Jackson the twist dance routine of Mia Wallace Uma Thurman and Vincent Vega John Travolta and the Mexican standoff in a diner However this masterpiece is not recommended for the faint- hearted as a lot of R - rated violent scenes of great detail are interspersed in the film The soundtrack has been compiled quite tastefully Misirlou sets a funky tone for the film during the opening credits Structurally the film is divided into seven sequences which have connected stories As expected the cameo from Tarantino himself as Jimmie the distraught husband in arguably the most entertaining part of the film - The Bonnie situation - proves to be the cherry on the cakepositive,Pulp Fiction Movie Review Although I am only 18 years of age barely a legal adult I must firmly say the film Pulp Fiction directed by Quentin Tarantino is the BEST film I have ever seen hands down The screenplay and storyline of the movie is not only intense but deeply intriguing as well The balance which is struck so masterfully by Tarantino to appeal to a wide variety of movie enthusiasts is what makes the movie spectacular Being a self proclaimed Tarantino fan the structure and flow of this movie reminds of his first ever film Reservoir Dogs The film was nominated for over 5 Oscar awards but ended up winning only one Best Original Script Winning Best Original Script is no small achievement This award is a testament to the quality and time that Tarantino puts into each of his movies and the script and plot line in Pulp Fiction is no different Additionally the film has some of the best actors in the modern era starring in the movie The star cast includes Samuel L Jackson John Travolta Bruce Willis Uma Thurman Tim Roth and Ving Rhames Jackson and Travolta team up in the movie to play a pair of hit men contracted to certain jobs by their boss Ving Rhames Bruce Willis plays the other hit men that has a personal beef with the boss of Jackson and Travolta Uma Thurman stars as the wife of Ving Rhames Finally Roth plays the psychotic husband of the couple that holds up the diner at the end of film Each of the main actors in the movie have won at least two awards for their performances in prior films showing the quality of each actor Together all six of them mesh beautifully to create a smooth yet emotional film After receiving what seemed like no praise or appreciation from the media Pulp Fiction finally won an Oscar best screenplay This is by far the most original and well made film that I have ever seen Many people have said that because the movie switches scenes and plot lines so much that the movie is unorganized and has no true story line I couldnt disagree with this statement more The way that the directors mesh the different scenes and plot lines of the movie is what makes the film legendary For example the main storyline in the movie is the combination of Jules Winfield Samuel L Jackson and Vincent Vega John Travolta two hit men that work for Marcellus Ving Rhames At times the film will show the two men carrying out hits extorting money or extracting information by all means necessary One of the prime examples of this is the apartment scene in which Jackson and Travolta enter the apartment of a handful of young men believed to be holding cash and information After they ask a few questions poke around for a bit and find what they need they make sure that all of the men are dead preventing them from causing future problems This is meant to show the business savvy side of Travolta and Jackson and evoke intense emotion from the viewer But in the next scene a completely different type of John Travolta is shown which is what makes his character so dynamic and appealing to the audience As Travolta and Jacksons boss leaves town his boss Mia Uma Thurman asks Travolta to take her on a date Both of them are clearly high on drugs when they meet making for an interesting line of action Travolta takes her to a 1950s diner which doubles as a dance club at night As the scene progresses Thurman volunteers them for a dance much to the dismay of Travolta Travolta reluctantly accepts following Thurman to the stage The dance goes well as the two perform beautifully and receive a standing ovation from the crowd But this is just the beginning of a disastrous night As the two leave the diner they return to Thurmans house As Travolta goes to the bathroom Mia discovers a bag of heroin which she mistakes to be cocaine As Travolta comes back to the living room he finds her lying on the ground motionless with blood running down her nose This leads Travolta to believe that it is an OD Travolta brings Thurman to a friends house where she is administered an adrenaline shot straight to the heart This sequence of the film is a prime example of balancing slow suspenseful action with intense on the edge of your seat emotion No other director has the talent or formula to combine drama action mystery and suspense all into one screenplay besides Tarantino Grossing over $107000000 lifetime many fans and movie enthusiasts agree with me as well Boxofficemojocom Each time I watch the movie I realize that it is one of the FEW films that I can enjoy every single time The legendary actors skillful directing and balance of several different plot lines creates a masterpiece In my opinion that is why Pulp Fiction is the greatest film of all timepositive,Pulp Fiction may be one of the most profoundly misunderstood films of our time One critic even called it a glorification of two whacked out hit-menOthers called it flippant nihilistic and cynical Yet others took the bizarre line that no film should be made about such worthless characters Yet others called it plotless and formless However a careful viewing of Tarantino s film should reveal that  like most of the pulp fiction  on which it is based it is indeed profoundly moral Even more Tarantinos film earnestly grapples with SPIRITUAL issues Tarantino has carefully studied the films of Dreyer and Bresson as well as those of Don Spiegel and Phil Karlson To make my case for the spiritual -and moral core of this film I will merely call attention to the ending of each of its three episodes Each one ends with a human life or lives being saved Yes  there is cynicism flippancy and studied coolness in Pulp Fiction However this is merely the glossy packaging in which Tarantino has concealed his profoundly-and rigorously- moral and spiritual message This is a film about redemptionpositive,Pulp Fiction is unique in the sense that it is the product of an unusually harmonious striking a perfect proportionality of all its parts and components And despite the fact that many of the elements of the artistic fabric of the film instantly served as an object for imitation are boldly innovative in themselves An indelible impression colorful characters cohort Any of the frame is decorated with a great sense of style is remembered outstanding color scheme the rhythm seems alive the acting is striking naturalness and yet well thought-out every word and gesture etc But in the first place among the findings must include a sparkling amazingly witty inventive and uninhibited speech that pours from the screen caused by the special delight of critics It seems there is no such subject from mediocre household to profound which would not have been affected by the authors one way or another  It sounded Hamlet words words words can achieve several important goals being both highly functional with respect to the action means of expressing the authors position at last so full of genuine poetry Excellent movie of the ones I was looking for the last time Good nice story that despite his ahem old age does not meet these films on the subject The dialogs in the film as well as the reaction of the characters in the stimulus by themselves are worth seeing the film In general if you have love for the action comedy with uninfected good emotion - this movie is for you _ film that wants to revise again and againpositive,Pulp Fiction is undoubtedly a masterpiece This movie single handedly got me interested in film making and movies themselves Quentin Tarantino writes directs and acts in what is hands down my favorite movie Before watching this movie I have never experienced such joy in listening to characters interact with witty dialogue This credit of course go to Tarantino writing in my opinion the best script ever My favorite part about the movie though are the characters Tarantino brings them to life so well and effectively that it is unlike anything Ive ever seen John Travoltas performance revived his career and morphed him into a formidable movie star This film really put Samuel L Jackson on the map Other performances that stand out to mealthough all are great are Bruce Willis and Harvey Keitel Keitels character is so quick and hilarious with his lines yet so serious and believable The Bonnie Situation is my favorite sequence in the movie Bruce Willis gives the best performance of his career Many will remember him for being a bad ass in die hard but I will remember him being a bad ass in Pulp Fiction Finally the mixed up sequences and various interpretable themes make this movie great The briefcase and Jules speech at the end are just fantastic This movie will always be my favoritepositive,Pulp Fiction is trully one of the best movies of the 90s Its wondarfully made and entertaining from begining to end Its not a standardly played movie instead its not in sequence and comes together at the end Its trully ogininal The performances are also great my favorite being John Travoltas If you havent seen this movie see it at once it will be a classicpositive,Pulp Fiction is the 2nd film directed by one of the greatest filmmakers of all time Quentin Tarantino It won an Oscar for best dialogue and was beaten for best picture by Forrest Gump Pulp Fiction tells the story of two mob hit men played by John Travolta and Samuel L Jackson a mob boss played by Ving Rhames the mob bosss wife played by Uma Thurman and a boxer played by Bruce Willis Every single actor/actress in this film plays the role brilliantly especially Samuel L Jackson The part which makes this film so good is its dialogue About 90% of this film is just people sitting around talking but the dialogue is so well written and interesting you could sit and watch them for hours This film deserved its Oscar by miles All those who go into this film expecting lots of shoot outs and explosions are not going to be impressed due to its long dialogue heavy scenes It has no philosophical messages or parts where you need to read between the lines if you want a film like that then I suggest you go and watch something directed by Stanley Kubrick Its a straight up entertaining film which you dont even need to watch all the way through once youve watched it a few times This film will go down in cinematic history as one of the greatest films of all time In my opinion it is the greatest film of all time along with Schindlers Listpositive,Pulp Fiction is Tarantino`s second movie and it is even better than Reservoir Dogs Pulp Fiction has stars like John Travolta Bruce Willis Harvey Keitel and Samuel L Jackson all those actors in a low-budget gangster movie Tarantino`s script is fantastic with lots of great characters weird situations great dialogue and violence Pulp Fiction brought Travolta`s carreer back on track and its easy to see why Travolta does a marvellous job as the gangster Vincent Vega Allmost of the actors are great in this movie 10/10positive,Pulp Fiction is simply the best movie that i have ever seen I can watch it again and again and it never gets old Quentin Tarantino is obviously a genius and Bruce Willis and Samuel L Jackson put in some of their best performances An interesting thing to do is to watch the movie and then try to figure out the chronological order of the plotpositive,Pulp Fiction is Quentin Tarantinos follow-up to Reservoir Dogs his promising debut film It is simply an amazing film Its a very intense fast-paced movie with alot of unusual characters played out by an outstanding cast The dialogue in this film is hilarious particularly John Travoltas Vincent and Samuel L Jacksons Jules The Big Mac scene is a classic The screenplay won a well-deserved Oscar The story is complex There were alot of things I noticed on future viewing that Id missed the first time probably because I was laughing too hard The cast is large and features alot of top actors: Travolta Jackson Uma Thurman Ving Rhames Bruce Willis and many others in smaller roles Christopher Walken makes a very brief but memorable appearance Pulp Fiction is a completly original film unlike anything Ive ever seen It was chosen as one of the top 100 films by the AFI Its one of my favorite movies one I can watch over and over and not get tired of itpositive,Pulp Fiction is phenomenal on so many different levels. Quentin Tarantino is a truly talented director that goes to no end to make his films powerful beyond belief. Pulp Fiction is just one example of the many great ones. The moment you turn on Pulp Fiction you know youre in for quite a ride. This film has all the necessary components to make it exciting gangsters fights drug conflicts etc. This movie is so mind bending because of all the twists and turns and chapters it takes you on. To say this movie is complicated would be an understatement but when youre finished watching it you are left sitting there thinking how amazing it actually is. Thurman Travolta and Jackson are just a few names whose acting make this movie what it is. You havent seen a great movie until youve watched Pulp Fiction.positive,Pulp Fiction is one of those movies that gets to you every time you watch it. This film is hands down one of the greatest icons in the film industry. It structures out a plot through different stories at different occasions and brings a one line connection throughout the whole story. Tarantino is not only my favorite film director but one of the most skilled at what he does. He provides an edgy plot with violence and references that happen in real life. Although Pulp Fiction may be far fetched from actual reality but it still is a realistic fiction piece. The characters are well formed and controversial and has distinct personalities throughout. This film is by far my favorite and one of the most well written pieces the world has seen.positive,Pulp Fiction is one of the two best films Ive ever seen The first time Ive seen the film was by chance But I found it great and have seen it 11 or 12 times againFor me its a real Kultfilmgerman  you get hooked in their mindless conversations and invest in their characters The soundtrack will make you bob your head throughout the whole film and bobbing it hours after youve seen it Its safe to say it is brilliant and really suits the film perfectly and when listened to sounds like it was perfectly made for a specific scene in the film This film Quentin Tarintino on the map as one of the directors to see because of the jazzy cool vibe his films have The directing is good with great uses of one shots and experimenting with transitions and angles such as the angle in which John Travolta and Samuel L Jackson get their guns from the car boot But the main star of the film is the writing The writing is genius and flawlessly executed by the actors You will be quoting this film a couple of years after you see it If you pick any line from this film it will probably be a good one Basically this film is a masterpiece and defined a genre that many writers will try to do positive,pulp fiction is one of my two favorite movies ever w/fargo its just so funny and absurd and great my favorite scene would have to be either the twist contest or christopher walkens scene the best line is are youtalking to meon a cellular phone i dont know you im hanging up nowbad person prank caller its out of context here but its so funny when you see it so if you havent seen it GO RENT IT RIGHT NOWpositive,Pulp Fiction is my all-time favorite movie. Ask me to list my reasons and I could go on and on about the acting characters dialogue or unexpected plot twists. But instead Ive finally realized just why I love this movie so much. I started to obsess over Pulp Fiction after I went on the internet and read about all the things about Pulp Fiction I might have never realized by casually watching the movie: what was in the briefcase what Ezekiel 25:17 means even little things like who keyed Vincents car. What Im trying to say is if you watched Pulp Fiction one or two times and didnt love it do a little internet research on this flick. Believe me after you have read all there REALLY is to the plot you will see three times the movie that you first thought was there and it will All Make Sense. In fact I only truly enjoyed Pulp Fiction the third time I watched it. But the plot is certainly not the only reason I love it. All of the characters are memorable and fit into the story like jigsaw pieces. You will ask yourself who the real main character was - Samuel L. Jackson John Travolta Ving Rhames My little obsession with this movie has gotten to the point where Ive taken a survey over who is better - Jules or Vincent To wrap it up - I believe Pulp Fiction is the greatest movie of the 90s and think that you should really indulge yourself in a bit of the trivia and make it a part of your world. Then perhaps you will agree with me that its depth dialogue and characters make even movies such as Forrest Gump seem dim-witted and hurried.positive,Pulp Fiction is movie making at its finest From the terrific acting esp Samuel the witty script and the best soundtrack in a movie its got it all Tarantinos best His let down was Jackie Brown I hope that he can try a different style of film next time But that aside this is definately one of the greatest of all time Easily a 10/10positive,Pulp fiction is masterpiece by three reasons first reason is acting is doing very well by actors second reason is cinematography using tracking shot trunk shot close shot medium shot third reason is directing skills by Quentin Tarantino homage many scenes from breathlesswalking tall evil dead and many more of films i am not sure to mention it Jules and Vincent talk about what they called hamburgers of McDonalds and in Amsterdam Quarters Pounder with a cheese called in Amsterdam is Royale with a cheese Big Mac called in LE Big Mac Jules winfields Ezekbiel 25:17 bible passage to Brett before put bullet in himpositive,Pulp Fiction is hands-down one of the greatest movies ever made. The cinematography is excellent the characters deep the tale supension and the plot well-written. Quentin Tarantino has outdone all previous efforts with his exceptioal tale of two hitmen a boxer a suitcase and the wife of a mob leader. All in all a terrific film that everyone should OWN and watch multiple times. I tell ya there is so much to miss on the first viewing multiple viewings are mandatorypositive,Pulp fiction is definitely the best movie ive ever seen It really has it all An excellent Travolta and Jackson A great performance by Willis And probably the best performance ever by Uma Thurman I dont think Tarantino will ever be able to do better then thispositive,Pulp Fiction is Black Comedy at its best and most twisted starting the film in the middle and going back to explain the Inconsistencys I cant explain it without bursting out in manic laughter Look out for a superb cast of John Travolta Samuel L Jackson Ving Rhames Bruce Willis Uma Thurman and Christopher Walken watch out and fear of the arse-bandit Zed and his pet gimp I MUST SAY NO MORE GO TO YOUR LOCAL VIDEO STORE AND HIRE ITpositive,Pulp Fiction is arguably Quentin Tarantinos masterpiece Everything from the writing to the presentation is phenomenal The characters are enthralling the soundtrack is amazing and the movie itself is just incredible from top to bottom Some would say its one of the most quotable movies of all time Its one of those rare films that I can honestly say has no legitimate flaws Ive seen it a thousand times and it never gets old Tarantino captured the classic look he was going for from the visuals of the film to the sounds and cinematography that you would see from a much older movie The movie feels very authentic If you havent seen it then I suggest going out right NOW and buying yourself a copy of this masterpiecepositive,Pulp Fiction is an incredible non-linear dark-comedy crime film about two hit men a gangsters wife a boxer and two bandits All four tales intertwine into a story of loyalty betrayal violence and redemption Pulp Fiction was written and directed by the excellent Quentin Tarantino and stars John Travolta Samuel L Jackson Uma Thurman and many more talented actors Everything about this movie is fantastic The dialogue is superbly and brilliantly written it is one of the best movie scripts ever produced The soundtrack is perfect and fits the tone for this extremely original masterpiece Pulp Fiction also contains tremendous performances from leads John Travolta and Bruce Willis to supporting acts like Uma Thurman and Harvey Keitel This stylistic thriller is one of the best movies of the 1990s and defined Quentin Tarantinos career With all the connected story lines and the interesting and intriguing screenplay Pulp Fiction is one of the most important movies of all time Because of all the pros of this film it is still rewatchable and lives up to todays movie standards You are doing yourself a disservice if you havent seen Tarantinos gem Pulp Fiction Ten-Outta-Ten starspositive,Pulp Fiction is a very unique masterpiecethere has never been a movie like it before and there will never be another film like this. This film changed hollywood movie making forever by being original and audatious. The entire cast of this fiolm gives knockout performances especially Samuel L. Jackson who helps deliver some outstanding dialouge.positive,PULP FICTION is a masterpiece from start to finish. A couple of hard boiled stories are waved together by only such perfection as Tarantino. Now Im not going to say that Big Q is my favorite director but there is no doubt that the man is a genius. Just look at the script And just as in his other masterpiece RESERVOIR DOGS the scenes and scenarios are harshly mixed up in one big mess. As a director well hes good but not that very original with some exceptions like the PULP-dancesceen and the ending in DOGS. His real magnificent lies in this adrenalin rush script. It is genius PULP FICTION is my second favorite after STAR WARS Im not sure why I love that film but hey sue me and it cant be compared to the rest of my top-movies nor Tarantinos others. FROM DUSK TILL DAWN is a big flat joke to this also NATURAL BORN KILLERS Tarantinos story and probably TRUE ROMANCE too. JACKIE BROWN is a good film but its one million floors down from this movie. The nearest so far is RESERVOIR DOGS. The direction of DOGS was better than PULP but PULP FICTION has got this screenplay that no other and I do mean NOT ONE has got. Lets go on to... acting. Well Ill put it like this: A majority of the actors do their best roles ever here is my PULP FICTION ACTING-GUIDE: TRAVOLTA: Definitely his best role so far. His portrait of VINCE is a classic. Its cool funny and you just smile by satisfaction while he slither around mrs.Wallaces house. And the dancing-scene is also notable. Here we see that Travoltas dancing king age is still not over. JACKSON: Its a hard choice but Im pretty certain that this is his best performance Ive seen. Hes around everywhere so its tough but he tops. Still its easier concidering the fact that his performance is THE BEST IN THE MOVIE The path of the ritcheus man is to be set on all sides... THURMAN: I have never been such a tremendous fan of Uma Thurman but this time were talking COOL CHICK. It is a shame that shes only in like 1/5 of the movie. We should see more of her. KEITEL: No mr.Wolf isnt his best. Im rooting for mr.White or the priest in FROM DUSK TILL DAWN. I know its a crap movie but the role is good. ROTH: Yeah mr.Orange is better but this one is on a good 2nd place. RHAMES: His best role Without a doubt. MARCELLUS WALLACE were talking respect here. IM GONNA GET MEDEVIL ON YOUR ASS He is one tough bastard. His scene with Willis was great and every other scene he was into in this great great movie. ARQUETTE: She isnt in this movie that much but it is by far her best performance. STOLTZ: Eric Stoltz is a great actor and I think every part he ever played is the best and Im sorry that hes not in this one that much. WILLIS: Bruce Willis might do his best performance and the most quality-role but I have a very hard time if Ill ever try to forget JOHN McCLANE. This is his second best role. Well lets not forget about ERIC ROBERTS and QUENTIN TARANTINO. Or should we Yes actually but lets try to focus on these two gentlemens too. Ok Roberts everybodys hate victim and the biggest C-actor since DOLPH LUNDGREN. And Tarantino might be a groovy director/writor but he actually is quite pale as an actor. PULP FICTION has also got BLOOD and VIOLENCE. It is a strong foulmouth and shocking but also classic movie. If you really loved RESERVOIR DOGS... WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR I can guarantee yes I can make out a promise sue me if this is wrong that youll at least like this movie. ALSO: Great sound and cool soundtrack. I first saw this movie four years ago and it is still just as great. Overall 10/10positive,Pulp Fiction is a great movie that can bring generations together. My Parents grandparents and even my younger siblings all enjoy getting to relax and enjoy this movie that will give you everything you want in a movie. For those who have a weak stomach or dislike movies with any blood at all I do not recommend. However if you are willing to suck it up and watch a movie where witty remarks are constant throughout the movie and have the possibility of making you think just a bit to understand what was meant by the characters. This movie is one of my favorites because it does a fabulous job convincing and getting you to suspend your disbelief. I will never forget the first time I watched Pulp Fiction and listened to the logic of robbing a caf’©. From that moment I knew that this was going to be a well done and fantastic movie that could compel me to believe what was going on and fear for the characters within this world of Pulp Fiction.positive,Pulp Fiction is a 1994 crime-drama directed and written by Quentin Tarantino Staring Jon Travolta and Samuel L Jackson as two BAMFs and Bruce Willis as Butch Let me just say before i dig into this that i have a massive bias to this movie Ive seen Pulp more than any other movie in fact the reason why i even took this class in the first place can be directly linked to my admiration for Pulp That being said Tarantino really showed that hes got game in this film Many people say that hes just a really big fan simply steals shots from other directors and one can certainly see the similarities between the shots but Tarantino manages to make it his own every time Even if the set up is exactly the same the shots he uses are able to stay Tarantino- esque Its also hard to point out one particular thing in this movie that stands out as the cinematography editing sound story acting and even the wardrobe stands out What makes this movie different from the rest is the non-conventional showing of the story Its non-linear its almost aggressively non-linear For years ive been trying to figure out what the order in which the stories are told mean im sure theres something there but i havent really been able to figure it out That being said though it doesnt hold the movie back At the end of the day this movie is everything a good movie could be Go watch it go obsess over it go talk about it go go go 10/10positive,Pulp Fiction has everything that you can want from a movie: A great story with great characters great actors a great director & 2 hours and 40 minutes of film that keeps you glued to the screen. Quentin Tarantino brilliantly weaves together 3 stories to make a film that is a true masterpiece. The dialogue is truly excellent and the acting from Samuel L. Jackson John Travolta Uma Thurman Bruce Willis Ving Rhames and many others is outstanding. I highly recommend this film and give it 10/10 stars.positive,Pulp Fiction definitely is a knockout film Apart from the intelligent original and refreshing chronological intertwine of different storylines the brilliant script is a gem It succeeds in making the mix of absurdly gross and directly shot violence and all day chit-chat more than believable Where else have you seen a guy commenting on the quality of his victim-to-bes Kahunaburger and asking him a sip of his beverage to wash it down seconds before pumping everyone in the room full-o-lead  When did you last see a scene in which one of the 2 bad guys accidently erase their captives brains during a car ride and then discuss the mess it creates the bump in the road that caused this and whos supposed to clean up without worrying even the slightest about the mans death  Not to speak of Walken in a small role handing Willis the watch that according to his monologue sat years in someones there-where-the-sun-dont-shine before being handed on without being completely unbelievable  All this completed with a cool worth-wile soundtrack very retro-sixties/seventies a great well-picked cast and the magic Tarantino touch this movie ROCKSpositive,Pulp Fiction continues to top lists of the best movies ever It continues to mesmerize everybody that sees it It continues to be seen as the best movie the cast has ever been in and the best movie Tarantino ever directed People that either watch movies on occasion or watch movies as hobbies love this People with thorough knowledge of film love it even more I would consider Pulp Fiction to be the best film of the 1990s beating out other classic in that decade such as Schindlers List and Terminator 2 Like most Tarantino films he does not put everything in chronological order That is a genius movie on his behalf that forces the viewer to stay until the end Even those very very very few that dont like Pulp Fiction were obligated to stay till the end That is also what made Tarantinos first movie Reservoir Dogs so thrilling Also Tarantino shows his knack for awesome dialogue that only he can deliver Pulp Fiction has three parallel story lines: The first deals with a couple called Ringo and Pumpkin Tim Roth Amanda Plummer that are also thieves They open up the film discussing the pros and cons of robbing a restaurant The scene is brief but the characters and dialogue is memorable Vincent Vega and Jules Winfield John Travolta Samuel L Jackson are two hit men sent to retrieve a briefcase for their boss Marcellus Wallace Ving Rhames containing a golden object that is not shown nor told Another genius movie on Tarantinos behalf A few deaths and survivals along the way have them questioning their beliefs This is probably the funniest story Pulp Fiction has sometimes been labelled as a dark comedy This is the story with most of its elements This also has the one with the best and grittiest look Soon after the incident Vincent is asked to entertain Wallaces wife Mia Uma Thurman while he is out of town They have a good time until she overdoses on heroin that Vincent got from his drug dealer Lance Eric Stoltz Although a small story the dialogue is just as sick as in the other stories and the character development is very deep Although this is the only bit with Mia she is developed deeper and stronger than many characters in full films The last is about club fighter Butch Coolidge Bruce Willis Wallace pays him a hefty sum to throw a fight but after having a crazy dream bets the money on himself and fights so hard that he kills his opponent He goes on the run with his girlfriend Maria De Medeiros from Wallace This is the story with the most excitement and the least amount of comedy Some bits are shocking but all fit together Bruce Willis as Butch is just as badass and heroic as John McClane As I mentioned earlier the all stories are done out of order but are all tied in in a very intelligent way Writing memorable dialogue like this is very hard creating awesome characters is even harder while making the movie look good and putting it out of order is the easy part Pulp Fiction has everything a good movie should have to the extreme that barely any other have achieved Only Tarantino could do a movie this goodpositive,pulp fiction begins with a pitch and ends with a homerun the movie from start to finish is one great roller coaster ride it will make you laugh at most with the close to real life dialogue the chemistry between the characters in the movie especially john travolta and samuel jackson john travolta and uma thurman tim roth and amanda plummer and bruce willis and maria de medeiros will keep you highly entertained at the end of the movie you will only wish it never ended the quirky dialogue combined with the fast paced violence is just as good as mixing gin with tonic quentin tarantinos style has influenced a legion of film directors throughout the nineties including bryan singer james mangold and paul thomas anderson he pretty much shaped the decade of movies with Pulp fiction reservoir dogs true romance and jackie brown and popularized independant movies all around pulp fiction is the best movie i have ever seen watching this movie alone is what a real movie-watching experience is all about i give it a solid 10 and no competition whatsoever by any other movie watch it yourself and you will know what i meanpositive,PULP FICTION 1994 Rating: 10/10 One of the most famous movies of the 1990s Pulp Fiction is a graphic crowd-pleasing shocking and awesome crime drama that boasts more astonishing ideas than any movie I can remember for the 1990-1995 period This is quite simply a masterpiece with poignancy comedy and sheer brilliance packed into one big explosive movie that well never forget Not only one of the best films of 1990s Pulp Fiction also gives us one of the most ensemble casts in a film ever Picture this: Rosanna Arquette Samuel L Jackson John Travolta Tim Roth Bruce Willis Christopher Walken Uma Thurman Ving Rhames and Eric Stoltz All of them give great performances and all are amazing actors What acting heaven But thats not the best thing about the movie believe it or not The script is Quentin Tarantino and Roger Avary breathtaking descriptive and unexplainably excellent screen-writing skills are Š—_ I just cant explain it The script is so good itll knock your socks off Quentins direction is also very worthy of praise  he dares to go the next step in filmmaking and wins the audience over Due to the extreme amount of violence drugs language and sexuality I strongly advise the faint-hearted and children to keep way away from this movie Otherwise if you dont mind a bit of naughty fun and a huge exciting spark in your movie-life then see this now Pulp Fiction is definitely an experience you wont forget easily positive,Pulp Fiction 1994 is the type of film you can see multiple times and still notice new things The characters are deep and the story is enthralling Tarantino uses discontinuity editing and the story is told out of order Each story is told as its own movie and the details of the characters are deep A movie about a crime boss and his hit men is sure to be filled with violence and Pulp Fiction is no exception Scenes are murder kidnapping and even a homosexual rape appear in the film Tarantino loves to push the limits and he does so in Pulp Fiction arguably his best filmpositive,Pulp Fiction 1994 is a crime film directed by Quentin Tarantino The film contains several separate stories that are presented in a non-chronological order The major characters are Vincent Vega John Travolta and Butch Coolidge Bruce Willis Vince is mob hit man working for boss Marsellus Wallace Ving Rhames Vince and partner are given the task of recovering a briefcase for their boss The briefcase is highly valued and Marsellus will stop at nothing to obtain it Butch is an aging boxer in debt to the mob Given an opportunity to make some cash Butch accepts a request by Marsellus to throw an upcoming fight allowing Marsellus a guaranteed winning payout on a bet At the last moment Butch has a change of heart and must flee with his ill-founded cash Tarantinos Pulp Fiction can be considered a modern day film noire While filmed in color Tarantino has provided all the classic elements Š—– Uma Thurman portraying the femme fatale Mia Wallace and Travolta Willis and Samuel Jackson as mob members who consider their criminal actions morally justified within the context of their realm Tarantino is able to take several major story lines and characters interweave them and tie everything together for the audience It is only at the end of the film do we understand all the scenes and stories presented The movie is even better watching a second time as one can better appreciate the nonlinear storylinepositive,Probably yes acting was good plot brilliant I mean Stephen King wrote the book but it cant match the film. When I sow this movie I thought thats it this is it best movie ever. Sure you can find people who didnt like it and when I ask why and try to guess what then happened They just confused themselves they can say reason why they dont like this movie... When I try to read comments with 1/10 star I cant find comment with good reasons that could make me realize that this movie is a bad movie If there is no reason then this means that its the best movie ever madeThe only reason people are giving 1 star is that they dont like ratio 92 they want to do more effect by pull this high ratio down I really hate them : Sorry for my bad English language I live in EUrope my English teacher is big cow with no knowledge...positive,Probably the most bizarre movie Ive seenToo real I stayed focused the whole movie A movie different from the others if you have not seen  do not expect a movie convectional His actors are great Great deal Samuel L Jackson Travolta Uma Thurman Bruce Willis and others P D Tarantino did not really like him but his irreverence breaking the mold in the way we produce is a genius Strong Real Scenes Some Comedy I do not want to launch any spoiler Only recommend as movie icon of the 90s I remember one afternoon I saw by chance among to her No plan to see it The result Excellent Screen somewhat opaque Something retrograde Very long so if Not for minors Disfruntelapositive,Probably the best movie in the series The hobbit and LOTR this movie is the best because of three crucial parts.First the Stunning CGI only a genius like Peter Jackson could create along with Weta Workshop.The CGI will make you feel like the orcs are standing right in front of you.Second up on the list is amazing writing.With dialog that makes it seem like real life instead of a moviewith most of the dialog coming from the books too.The finally thing that makes this movie great is the soundtrack.Often Put down as one of the best soundtracks everthe sad violin theme for rohan the iconic gondorian theme and even the Mordor theme are good.And you cant deny it you probably cried towards the end of the movie.Yes maybe the ending is a little over the top and gimli really isnt that cool and serves as comic relief but otherwise this movie is flawless.positive,possibly the most important movie to be released in the 90s everything about this movie is perfect from the brilliant dialogue to the flawless editing right down to all the little details in virtually every single scene my all time favorite scene still has to be the adrenaline shot sequence at lances house the banter between the characters in that scene is so realistic and dead on that i almost forgot i was watching a movie quentin tarantino is one of the ONLY directors next to paul thomas anderson who seems to have any kind of grasp on what can make movies the best art form ever createdpositive,possibly the most entertaining movie ever kingsman the secret service is comprised of both oldfashioned flair and modern style each scene is methodically planned and executed ktss also contains some of the greatest action scenes in recent years the characters are likable the plot is mostly believable and the cinematography is beautiful with the perfect combination of plot acting action and humor kingsman is exciting throughout and receives without a doubt a 1010 kingsman the secret service is likely to entertain almost all who see it and i highly recommend it to allpositive,Plot: Andy Dufresne Tim Robbins is a banker convicted of a murder he did not commit and sent to Shawshank prison. After two months of being there he meets Red Morgan Freeman a man who knows how to get things. The warden Bob Gunton uses Andys banking skills for his scams and turns out to be more ruthless than he thought. Andy spends twenty years in prison before his legendary escape. This is said to be the best film ever made. I can see why. It is defiantly my favourite film of all time. Some say it is too over rated and that might be true but theres no doubt it is a fantastic and well executed film. The acting is good. Morgan Freeman is an excellent narrator. William Sadler is also good. You cant help but laugh with Haywood. The Shawshank Redemption is a brilliant story of hope friendship and obviously redemption. It also has a way of connecting with the viewers experiences. People relate their own life to the film and it helps people deal with bad moments it their lives. This is not a film to miss.positive,plot the year is unknown but most likely close to present time the earth is running out of resources and a group of underground nasa workers seek the help of engineerastronaut turned farmer mr cooper in taking a journey across the galaxy and through a wormhole in hopes of a future for mankind on the other side that is the gist of the exposition of the plot its mostly quite clear what this movie is about through previews on paper this sounds like a typical scifi plot but chris nolan executes it like never before the movie seems to be getting more mixed reviews from critics compared to his other films and i think i have an explanation nolan and his team had too much faith in its audience the movie is full of science and dialogue strongly textured with physics theories the talk of wormholes and black holes are key to the movie but i know that many will be left confused even with the explanations of what is going on to make everything in the film scientifically possible after all physicist kip thorne was a consultant for the movie i found it quite educational interesting but also over done at times a good majority of people who watch this movie will be turned off by the abundance of scientific talk throughout the movie i personally loved it and was never lost but i could understand why many people were frustrated with the constant turns in the plot and overlong length i found this movie to be amazing sure at times the dialogue was hard to even understand there was a scene where a major character is dying and as he speaks his last words its almost impossible to decipher what is said it was also almost unintentionally humorous but that was a small price to pay and im sure the subtitles of the blu ray release will save that scene for me the directing and cinematography are gorgeously done the camera angles really bring the movie to life simple shots from the point of view of the rear of a truck or spaceship never looked so amazing the visuals were undeniably beautiful whether the setting was in space on the foreign planet or even the decaying earth the music of the film by hans zimmer deserves so much recognition i will even say it was better than the  for inception it really increased the tension and pushed for emotional heartache in many parts of the film there are many tense scenes that will have you holding on along with the characters in the movie and a good portion of this effect is due to the musical  the acting was top class matthew m gave one of the greatest human performances in history as mr cooper i seriously think it was better than his dallas buyers oscar winning performance i really hope he gets recognition for this there are more than a few scenes that will make even the most cold hearted person feel like crying he was just amazing anne hathaway gave a stunning emotional performance as the flawed bland jessica chastain has a few strong moments as well there is a scene regarding her character breaking down which will definitely make your eyes water the supporting cast all do justice to the movie too but matthew and jessica gave the best performances without a doubt in a way this movie resembles inception in certain areas inception had a hint of relativity in it with the time differences between the dreams the real world and limbo interstellar adds to that with the inclusion of a planet in the other galaxy in which every hour is equal to 7 years outside of its atmosphere in inception a central character is left behind and lost in the limbo world with its major difference of time in interstellar a central character is left behind in the other galaxy to find a new home while the other leaves to help the current home adjust until then in inception a central character is old for a moment in limbo at the end due to the difference in time relativity in interstellar the time relativity affects the entire human race as the astronauts are in the other galaxy in both movies the main character has left behind children and longs to be reunited inceptions main character doesnt want to see his childrens faces until they are truly reunited but in interstellar he holds on to the image of their faces as a survival tactic this movie is full of christopherjonathan nolanisms overall i think that this movie should be seen in theaters on the big screen if you have the chance it was a true experience be sure to be attentive and to clear your bladder first though it will make you think at times it might make you check your watch but please endure and you will be treated to one of the most intriguing films of all time even if you think you didnt like the film there is no doubt that you will be thinking about the contents of the plot and beauty of the visuals long after the credits rollpositive,Peter Jacksons Lord of the Rings trilogy is likely to be the movie event of my lifetime. I may never see anything to equal its combined ambition scope and cinematic invention in my days on this earth. People who carp at and critizise little individual facets of The Return of the King are surely missing the boat - its like looking at the Statue of Liberty and saying Oooh see there I think theres a flaw on her elbow..... For heavens sake - these film-makers took on a vast multi-plotted fantasy that defied being told on a screen. The fact that they didnt turn out a stinker is credit enough - that they told the entire story coherently and well with every moment brimming with drama and visual imagination beggars belief. The project is the cinematic phenomenon of our time and anyone who doesnt see that whether or not the genre of which its a part floats their particular boat just isnt looking. Having said all that the Extended Editions of these movies are for me the definitive versions so I await with huge anticipation the Return of the King box-set where the sub-plots can be leisurely played out in all their glory. Maybe Ill post a full-scale review then.....positive,Peter Jacksons Lord of the Rings trilogy comes to its epic conclusion in fine style: Frodo and Sam enter Mordor while the Battle of the Pelennor Fields begins largely as a feint to draw Saurons army away to allow the Ringbearer clear passage to Mount Doom. Following the Ring meeting its fate all story lines are brought to their resolutions in a half hour or so of winding down. Jacksons visualisation of what happens inside Mount Doom is faithful to and improves upon Tolkiens source - once again Tolkien threw away one of his set pieces in less than a page. The one false note is Gollums final expression - I would have expected agony rather than Blimey Thats a bit of a surprise There are at least five separate end-pieces - the Fellowship reunited Aragorns coronation the return to the Shire the Grey Havens and Sams return home it is possible to argue at least a couple more. The film could have been ended on any of these and there are those who argue that it should have been. But although the film could have ended there the story could not and credit to Jackson for adding a half hour capstone to a ten hour film in order to properly resolve all that should have been resolved. I feel this particularly strongly since this closing section contains two of my favourite moments. One is the moment in the tavern - the four Hobbits traumatised by war sit together in silence in stark contrast to the trivial carousing in the opposite bookend tavern scene in Fellowship. And the other is Frodos final look back. If Elijah Wood never delivers another moment on screen as powerful as that one and Im sure he will that is enough. A towering achievement in all respects.positive,Peter Jacksons epic adaptation of Lord of the Rings reaches its pinnacle in Return of the King. The stellar cast mind-blowing special effects and heartbreaking script are all present in the third movie which is not only the last of the Lord of the Rings films but the best. Frodo Elijah Wood and Sam Sean Astin are still following the treacherous Gollum Andy Serkis on the path to Mordor with the increasingly strained Frodo unaware that Gollum is sowing suspicion between the two best friends. By the time he realises his mistake hes been dragged into the lair of Shelob a monstrous spider and then abducted by orcs who want the Ring he carries. Determined to find his friend Sam heads into an orc citadel... Meanwhile Gandalf Ian McKellen takes Pippin Billy Boyd with him to Minas Tirith after the hobbit has a close encounter with Sauron through a palantir. \Not only is the city under siege but the Steward Denethor is slowly going insane even sending his one remaining son Faramir David Wenham on a suicide mission to reclaim a dead city. With Minas Tirith crumbling Aragorns Viggo Mortensen only hope may to be summon an army of the dead who will only obey the King of Gondor. But even the dead wont help him if Frodo doesnt destroy the Ring... The Lord of the Rings trilogy is one of those once-in-a-lifetime movie experiences. There has never been anything quite like it in movie history and there probably never will be again. It seems somehow fitting that the book that every other fantasy has to measure up to has now become a sweeping cinematic triumph that actually stays halfway loyal to the books. Good things come to fans who wait I guess. Peter Jackson really outdoes himself. You know those battle scenes in Two Towers and Fellowship of the Ring with the swooping camera and thousands of orcs clashing with men on a gloomy battlefield In Return of the King Jackson surpasses that. Theres everything from volcanic eruptions to an invasion of howling ghosts to the attack of the oliphaunts like elephants only bigger. Each action scene a shattering ride and theres no guarantee that all the beloved characters will make it out alive. Some of them dont. But if Jackson manages the epic battles well he does an even better job with the gentler quieter moments. The action slows down and the characters take a moment to support and comfort each other. They cry they hug they think about home -- such as Gandalf comforting the frightened Pippin with a description of the afterlife. Jackson and his fellow screenwriters Fran Walsh and Phillippa Boyens throw themselves into the semi-formal language of Tolkiens world resculpting Tolkiens words into equally rich movie dialogue. Elijah Wood gives an unparallelled performance as Frodo Baggins. Frodos gradual deterioration is wrenching to watch and the climactic scene at Mount Doom displays just what the Ring can do to even the pure-hearted hobbit. Sean Astin follows up with his powerful performance as Sam who is increasingly the strong hobbit rather than the follower. The final scenes between these two outstanding actors are beautiful and understated. But all the supporting cast also give powerful performances -- Boyd and Dominic Monaghan put their characters through some intense growing pains and the Im going to take care of you scene is enough to bring tears to your eyes. Mortensen gets more kingly every moment while Ian McKellen balances action with grandfatherly wisdom. Bernard Hill has a quietly moving final scene while Miranda Otto makes the despairing Eowyn a strong kick-butt heroine. Perhaps the most striking thing about Return of the King is the final fourth of the film. While the multiple endings may annoy some viewers it seems somehow right to gently let go of these characters rather than have a sudden splashy finale. And whether they have a happy or sad ending Jackson never lets us forget that they all made sacrifices to battle Sauron. Return of the King brings the epic Lord of the Rings trilogy to a close and cements Jacksons reputation as a master filmmaker. With the outstanding cast beautiful scripting and amazing direction this is the best of the Lord films -- and thats saying something.  and hes been my another most favourite actor ever since Lord of the Rings is one of most commercially successful movies of all time also the most Oscar-winning movie in history together with Titanic and Ben-Hur. Thank you Lord for this film... positive,Peter Jacksons directing of the final installment to the trilogy is nothing short of a miracle. The battle of Minas Tirith was stunning the CG is highly realistic and the characters integrate very well into the scenes. The dialogue of the characters mostly correspond to Tolkiens portrayal in the bookpositive,Peter Jackson works magic For all of you who whined about the plot changes from the bookspositive,Peter Jackson was right: this is the best movie of the series - and that is saying something because The Two Towers was superb. The correct genre for the Lord of the Rings series is horror/fantasy and never before has horror or fantasy been attempted on such a grand scale. The scenery is stunning the action sequences spectacular the horror superbly done. There is some humour a perfectly blended music  and of course computer imaging without peer. The character of Gollum/Smeagol is one of the great achievements in cinema history and the battle scenes pure genius. Need I say more: this is one of the cinemas true masterpieces a stunning finale to a superb series.  this isnt a film that feels improvised in any way. On some very odd occasions this can result in some lines feeling a little forced but the pay-off is massive as the script is quite simply genius in many ways. This great writing has created some excellent iconic characters. It doesnt do any harm either that the acting is top level throughout. Well with the exception of Tarantinos cameo that is Š—– hes pretty terrible and should really never act. But otherwise its quality all the way with standout turns from Samuel L. Jackson John Travolta Bruce Willis Harvey Keitel Christopher Walken and Uma Thurman. Jackson probably steals the show with the character Jules but Travolta is very impressive and convincing as Vincent Vega Š—– you really believe he is a pretty nasty bit of work under the charm. Thurman and Willis play typical film-noir characters namely the femme fatale and the boxer who throws the fight Š—– both are excellent. While Keitel and Walken have cameo roles with the former as the very memorable Mr Wolf while the latter is in an extremely funny role as an ex-soldier who wore a watch up his butt. So whats it all about Well the title says it all really because this is an unashamed bit of pulp fiction but a wonderfully original presentation of it. Its influence is other movies such as Italian poliziotteschi and American film noir with a huge post-modernist make-over. Films specifically referenced include The Italian Connection a black and white gangster hit men are sent to sort a situation out and Kiss Me Deadly a plot revolves around a suitcase that when opened has a mysterious glow. It is essentially a crime-comedy with a real focus on humour. This means that some of the strong violence is played simultaneously realistically but also for comic effect. While the staggered time-line is constructed for maximum impact. It is for example a pretty rare thing for a film to kill off a character Vincent and then go back in time a little to watch his exploits in another escapade. We know he is doomed but cant help but completely forget this fact. Its one of many reasons that this film stands out. One of the very best of the 90s and Tarantinos masterpiece. positive,Peter Jackson truly outdid himself with this instalment of the Lord of the Rings trilogy. This is the best of all three. Better than the first two combined. The battle sequences and the action in this movie surpasses the action and battle sequences in The Fellowship of the Ring and The Two Towers. And you finally see why Frodo Baggins decided to go on the journey that he did and see Gollums decent into madness from the one ring. After I saw this movie I was so overjoyed and it just blew me away and it kept my full attention all the way from beginning to end. I do not think any other fantasy movie can measure up to Return of the King. The first two films almost measure up to this one. Return of the King is a true Masterpiecepositive,Peter Jackson one director one trilogy amazing combination A Director who made us live each and every moment of the LOTR No one could have made it better. the whole cast and crew was lucky enough to be a part of such an amazing journey and delivered world class performance FrodoElijah Wood is just too good as an hobbit carrying the burden of the ring Gandalf  Ian McKellen is just unimaginably powerful Aragorn  viggo mortensen  being the king of minas tirith is too awesome to resist the other character like Legolas and Gimli the old rivalry turned friendship is fun to watch. overall a movie made once and can never be made again and shall stay that way for long years to come in fact words fall short writing a review about such an epic fantasy adventure. I wish there was 11 to vote...positive,Peter Jackson is absolutely amazing No matter what Peter Jackson is working on you can be sure to see excellent craftsmanship. Lord Of The Rings seems to be a placed where everyone would like to visit. From the Elvish language that everyone wanted to learn to speak. Due to the eloquence when the actors spoke. Right down to the amazing sets. He is able to take you into a world beyond your expectations. The actors did a wonderful job in bringing their characters to life. Each actor was dedicated to portraying their characters. The costumes were wonderfully designed making one want to be apart of this magical world and who wouldnt want to live in the Shire. I recommend seeing Lord Of The Rings. You will not be disappointed. It was beyond the minds expectations.  this film isnt for everyone. But its a lot of fun to watch and this is because of Tarrentionos cool ideas. So if your really into film youll probably like this. If youre female or liked Titanic or both Im thinkin you probably wont. positive,Peter Jackson in his artistic is able to created the single greatest masterpiece of a movie that I have ever witnessed.Everything about this movie staggered my imagination. The actors McKellen Mortenson WOod Aston etc. are able to portray their respective characters that Tolkein described to perfection. Furthermore the directing sound costumes and effects all combined with each other to create an unprecedented masterpiece. Only two movies Shawshank Redemption and Forrest Gump in my mind compete with the genius of The Return of King. What separates LOTR from other films though is its success in converting a fantasy into not only a mainstream smash but an eleven Oscar-winning film. For these reasons I immensely enjoyed this truly unique epic.positive,Peter Jackson has managed to make the audience feeling like in another time. From the first scene till the last one you are in the world of middle earth. I couldnÎ‚t imagine the Characters to be played by others than Elijah and Co. This movie is a real breath taker.positive,Peter Jackson did a marvelous job. This could be the year of the King come Oscar night. I would not be surprised if it gets more than 10 nominations. Although he left out some parts like the war in the Shire by the Hobbits and the Ruffians it didnt deviate from the main focus of the story. Best parts of the movie was the Paths of the Dead scene and the siege of Gondor. Aragorn was imposing to the ghosts. As for the siege of Gondor what more can I say. The fight scene was made to perfection. I liked the way Peter Jackson at the start of the movie introduced how Gollum came to be. It was in my opinion the one of the most critical elements of the entire series. If that would not had been shown the story would be incomplete. Even though the movie started in the middle of the Two Towers book it didnt affect much. The acting was superb. The stunts especially that of Legolas killing an oliphant were amazing. I think Jackson made the best decision when he cast Elijah Wood to be Frodo Baggins and Sir Ian McKellen as Gandalf. I would not be surprised if Wood gets a nod for a nomination for Best Actor and McKellen a 2nd crack for Best Supporting Actor. In general King deserves to be nominated for an Oscar. And if it wins the Best Picture lets all start chanting Hail to the Kingpositive,Peter Jackson delves deep into the works of Tolkien to bring to life the emotions of the denizens of Middle Earth. The three hours and eleven minutes of the movie leaves the watcher gasping hoping yearning At the end you dont want it to end and you are left with a sence of serenity and peace. It is a must see movie for all who love Tolkien and the Lord of the Rings series.positive,Personally I was and I am ashamed to say this quite late to join the huge number of film fans that would hold The Shawshank Redemption within their Top 5 films of all time - if not number 1. If youre wondering mine is The Princess Bride childhood favourite but thats beside the point. I think the first time I watched it was in 2006 and I instantly fell in love with it. I now watch the film at least 5/6 times a year without fail and I am hardly ever far from tears of joy by the end. If you use the old analogy of If an alien came to earth show them how... to make a film you would show them this as the blueprint. Just brilliant.positive,PERFECTION has to be the best word to describe this terrific movie. It has everything you could ever want including a great story characters direction editing sound music effects acting funny lines settings. I could go on forever with praise talking about how outstanding this movie is and how emotional it was. It has to be the greatest movie ever made. FOTR and TTT were both terrific as well but this one has to be the best of all three by far. Once I walked out that cinema theatre I was just blown away and knew it was and if you havent seen it yet then let me tell you now. This movie will take your breath away. Enjoy now and for many milleniums to come Outstanding 1000000000000/10positive,people will have interesting reactions to this film all of matthew vaughns movies have been good and he was able to push it further with this one i would call it an action comedy but there is more of an emphasis on the action than the genre usually has there are cool pov shots and it gets you right into the thick of it it mixes it up with some short moments where it doesnt cut so quickly as well as a few long takes that are particular nice the violence and comedy has a guttural component which a person like me really enjoys but it will throw some off the film is a throwback to old spy flicks while at the same time being a sort of parody it is humorous throughout samuel l jackson plays an odd megalomaniac who makes you laugh more than shiver which goes with the tone of the movie it is nice to see samuel l in the role of a bad guy i have no doubt that many will enjoy the henchwoman who has a different element to her colin firth fits in with the particularly suave spying and the newcomer playing the protagonist taron egerton handles both the action and comedy well mark strong is always a good actor for movies with dark humor it is fun however those who are sensitive may have trouble enjoying it it is not a film for everyone but that makes it better for others i personally think it is vaughns best work 875positive,Overall I am disappointed though not surprised by the negative criticism of this movie. Indeed this criticism exceeds the offering of alternative viewpoints and the expression of other cinematic possibilities and sinks into the realm of bitter invective. So many armchair critics are currently competing with avid Tolkien Jackson and movie fans alike in order to espouse the true value of Peter Jacksons landmark movie trilogy. For it is a landmark event in cinema history based on its sheer size and careful attention praise and evisceration apart. The issue that greatly irritates me and pushes me to write is that many of the negative reviewers on this website have such limited room in their imagination that they cannot conceive of a world outside their own narrow framework. I find that a most sad reality in light of the legacy of Tolkien Jackson and all good story-tellers -- to create to engender and to nourish the growth of any and all imaginative ventures. The problem with imagination is that it is an individual event a unique subjective experience that a single person experiences completely alone. Those who enter into the realm of Art Fiction Fantasy and any degree of Story-telling agree willingly or no to take that personal act of creation and primal nature and share it with the community of human beings each of whom has his or her own imaginative context. It is a bold act of sacrifice self-confidence and faith spiritual one could argue to thrust the contents of ones subjective reality into to borrow from Douglas Adams the Whole Sort of General Mish Mash. People who do so deserve respect for the mere creative act the ability to foist forward what they believe is true. From Homer to Bill OReilly this concept of personal creation what Tolkien called Sub-Creation is the essence of modern human existence and we owe it to each other to respect the right to creation history has granted us. Therefore in defense of both Tolkien whom some on this website have maligned and Jackson whom many have maligned I forward that both are imaginative creators in their own right with different and completely acceptable offerings to the world. Those who cannot tolerate either for mediocre writing or atrocious film-making should offer forth their literary or cinematic offspring instead of cunningly-worded diatribes of their deep dissatisfaction with all that does not conform to their inner reality. Then we few who believe in and trust the creative ability of all will be able to see how those critical inner realities so authoritative in exposition match up with the rest of our perceptions. Tolkien was an enormously talented intelligent and imaginative man one whose stories though unpolished by experience still managed to attract a worldwide audience and devoted following with their luster. Jacksons movies took the sheen and inherent value of Tolkiens stories and placed it in a visual medium a place where fans of LOTR could witness and love the events and people they held so dear. Of course Tolkiens story is imperfectpositive,over the summer i had seen the advertisements and commercials for the movie guardians of the galaxy when i first saw the commercial all i could think was this looks silly and then i saw the fact it was part of the marvel series and i was torn whether or not to go watch it while it was still in theaters it did not look good but maybe it would play a big role in the marvel movie series but i did end of going to see it for the heck of it and absolutely loved it overall the movie was humorous very entertaining and in my opinion a great addition to the marvel series and even gained a rating of 92% on the movie critic website rotten tomatoes throughout the movie the thing that stood out the most was the humor part of the movie there were parts of the movie i just could not stop laughing because it was so silly and just so amusing to watch and enjoyable i mean the way you know it is a humorous movie is when you come out of the theater repeating lines and talking about parts of the movie and still just laughing as much as you did when you saw the movie and this is a movie that passes that test another killer part of the movie that made it so good was the soundtrack that went through the movie the biggest role the soundtrack has to a movie is to provide the noise for times where there is not dialog and just brings a smile to your face in the movie the main leader of the guardian of the galaxies starlord he plays a tape his mother gave him that brings back the classic musical hits that you just cannot help but sing along to and just smile while remembering the good old days overall the acting was pretty superb and each actor brought their own flare and became the character very well even just in the voice overs for characters such as rocket and groot apart of the movie that i really enjoyed was the way each actor had their chance to make their character shine and make them seem important and walking away you realize that each character had importance to the group and the actors all came together to form a pretty solid team called the guardians of the galaxies probably the most controversial aspect of the movie is the whole marvel aspect marvel over the years has made a killing in suckering viewers to come see their latest hits and leave us at the end wanting another marvel movie to come to theaters to continue the story i know many people saw the commercials thought the same thing i did who on earth are the guardians of the galaxies? most people know who spiderman ironman or even the incredible hulk are but unless you read the comic books you would most likely have no clue who the guardians of the galaxies are throughout the movie though i believe the writer did a good job in tying in the marvel universe and made a point by using characters most people would have no idea how they were connected to the story line that viewers have come to know through all other marvel movies and the big hitter that brings them all together the avengers going off the mpaa rating of the movie pg13 seems somewhat appropriate due to little bit of foul language and a couple of references to alcohol and gambling however i do think the movie can still be considered a family because it does bring a humorous aspect and nothing to raunchy is presented and besides what kid does not love a talking raccoon or even a tree that can only say i am groot overall i really enjoyed this movie and would definitely watch it over again marvel has done a very good job in adding a new addition to the movie series through the all the humor the acting the action the soundtrack and in the end i walked away from the movie hoping to see more of the guardians of the galaxies in future marvel moviespositive,over 12 years of the making of goodness through the scenes of them moving and camping and school and very intimidating life if you happen to pass by a theater playing it go and watch it 165 minutes of inspiration of the life of a young man mason from age 5 to age 18 as there father and mother are separated and lives with hes sister and mother and sees hes father each year as the mother keeps on marrying men then they become a threat to them they move across the united states to find a nice place but as mason is growing and finds a job and grow up in to college the mother doesnt find much luck  the movie of a lifetime   cameron rusepositive,outstanding image and sound atmosphere well performed by the lead actors the subject is very carefully constructed it keeps you interested all the time surreal landscapes for scifi lovers i noticed a new technique that attracted my attention loud sounds followed by total sudden silence with exceptional imaging to make you focus on watching the screen undisturbed by other stimuli this way you wont loose the detail that the director wanted you to capture very original for the visual and audio part interstelar is pure art of the scifi genre a priceless gem in an ocean of cinematic junk that overflows in the present very original plot carefully presented and leaving quite a space to interpretation and to meditate upon it as a scifi fan i highly recommend watching this film it will leave you very impressed and satisfiedpositive,Outrageously violent time-twisting and in love with language Pulp Fiction was widely considered the most influential American movie of the 1990s Director and co-screenwriter Quentin Tarantino synthesized such seemingly disparate traditions as the syncopated language of David Mamet  the serious violence of American gangster movies crime movies and films noise mixed up with the wacky violence of cartoons video games and Japanese animation  and the fragmented story-telling structures of such experimental classics as Citizen Kane Rashomon and La Joete The Oscar-winning script by Tarantino and Roger Avary intertwines three stories featuring Samuel L Jackson and John Travolta in the role that single-handedly reignited his career as hit men who have philosophical interchanges on such topics as the French names for American fast food products  Bruce Willis as a boxer out of a 1940s B-movie  and such other stalwarts as Harvey Keitel Tim Roth Christopher Walken Eric Stoltz Ving Rhames and Uma Thurman whose dance sequence with Travolta proved an instant classic positive,Out of pulp true fleshy meaty stories form. Set in the criminal underworld of 90s Los Angeles Pulp Fiction revolves around the disparate yet interconnected cast. Quentin Tarantinos Par Excellence Pulp Fiction toys with our hearts our humour popular culture and even the conventions of narrative cinema itself. The movie has been a firm favourite of mine for a long time. The movie has a stellar to cast to bolster the glare of the mighty storyline with a killer soundtrack to match. It is gritty powerful funny insightful dark and precious with some jaw dropping moments and heart stopping dialogue. As definitive a 90s movie as is ever as likely to get and stylistic to Tarantino himself who has managed to carve his own dialect into the language of Hollywood.positive,Only once every few years does a movie of this caliber get released the last movie of recent days that impressed me as much as this film did was The Lord of the Rings trilogy so this film is now sitting in my opinion with the biggest films of all time. The acting in this film is mostly superb i say mostly cause the performance of Maggie Gyllenhaal leaves a little bit to be desired and the voice that Christian Bale puts on when he becomes the dark knight is a little over the top plus some very average performances from many minor characters but Aaron Eckhart Michael Caine Gary Oldman and Morgan Freeman are all excellent and so is Christian Bale for the most part when you look past the over done voice. For obvious reasons I left one name out of the list and its the name everyone has been talking about since this movie was released the sadly departed Heath Ledger. Heaths performance as the joker is beyond excellent it puts him up with the greatest actors of all time including Marlon Brando and Johnny Depp. He undoubtedly becomes the Joker and throughout the film you never really see Heath Ledger you are looking at Batmans most famous villain not a man playing him. I did have doubts when i first heard they were casting Heath as the Joker but obviously my doubts have been put to bed. Now what makes this film great is not just the acting its the storyline the directing by Christopher Nolan and the all round production values are just superb and surpasses the excellent Batman Begins by a few miles. The only thing i will say against the storyline is that Harvey Dents phase as Two-Face is way too short lived they killed him off after about 45 minutes of the character being in the film which disappointed me a little cause Two-Face is an excellent villain. All in all a brilliant film that deserves all the hype and praise it gets and more with only a few very niggling problems that dont effect the overall  of this film one bit.positive,One word to sum it all up. Amazing. The Dark Knight has been my favorite movie since I had seen it in the theateras part of a Dark Knight/ X-Files: I Want to Believe double feature. and remains thus. Everything about The Dark Knight stands out not only amongst other comic book movies but movies in general. The tone was one of insanity and chaos perfectly match by the on-screen antics of none other than The Joker Batmans greatest foe. Thus we segue into the major article of discussion for this movie the brilliant Heath Ledger. Taken from us too soon Heath Ledger not only made this character his own but he also took the time to learn and understand it. He knew The Joker inside and out playing the role perfectly in every way. With no regard for his own life or anyone elses the Joker embarks on a quest of sorts to tear Gotham apart by attempting to turn its greatest citizens into twisted versions of the heroes they once were while Batman tries to stay true to his values with the help of the always supportive Alfred Pennyworth expertly performed by Michael Kaine Gothams brave new DApositive,One of the movies worth to watch always again and again....The Movie entertains you from the very start to the very end.No matter how many times you watch the movie you would not feel bored at all. It is one of those kind of movies which makes a place in your mind as one of the best movies watched and worth to be watched again and again.A movie which is at a level which is very high.Indeed the Christopher Nolan trio-logy makes the batman comic character look very good. Christian Bale is one the the best Hollywood actor I have ever seen.. His acting as Batman and Bruce Wayne is too good.Heath Ledger on the other hand definitely played the Joker character too goodhe really scares the audience by his acting. This is one of the best movie made by Christopher Nolan and definitely for more movies from Christopher Nolan And Jonathan Nolan.positive,One of the greatest movies ever made. Shawshank tells the story of Andy Dufresne a banker convicted of his wives and her lovers murder. When Andy comes across inmate Red the two form a near two decade long relationship. With Tim Robbins and Morgen Freeman in lead roles Shawshank is an absolute masterpiece that every film lover should watch. Frank Darabonts directing is great and even more so than any of his previous work. Theres really not much wrong with Shawshank. The adaptation from Stephen Kings epic novel is compelling exciting disheartening and inspiring. With great supporting characters an incredible plot and stunning directing Shawshank has become one of the greatest movies ever made. Its an absolute travesty that this didnt win the Oscar for Best Picture in 1994 although there was some stiff competition.positive,One of the greatest movie ever made. The storyline the acting and of course the ending - all perfect.. Definitely the strongest of the movies in the trilogy. The movie itself is breath-taking exciting incredibly emotional and tough in so many different levels. I get the same stunning feeling every time i watch it. Christian Bale & Heath Ledger really managed to pull it off #The scene when Batman has to choose between saving Rachel or Harvey Dent.. Damn And how the Joker manages to break even one of the very best. And THEN twists him leaving him suffering as a changed man making some really bad decisions. Not to mention all the chaos he made in Gotham.. Until Batman shows up attempting to clean up all the madness. I am still not 100% sure if Joker actually won at the end or Batman kinda succeed.. Anyways this is a movie that will be watched in many many centuries. R.I.P Heath Ledgerpositive,One of the finest films made in recent years. Its a poignant story about hope. Hope gets me. Thats what makes a film like this more than a movie. It tells a lesson about life. Those are the films people talk about 50 or even 100 years from you. Its also a story for freedom. Freedom from isolation from rule from bigotry and hate. Freeman and Robbins are majestic in their performances. Each learns from the other. Their relationship is strong and you feel that from the first moment they make contact with one another. There is also a wonderful performance from legend James Whitmore as Brooks. He shines when it is his time to go back into the world only to find that the world grew up so fast he never even got a chance to blink. Stephen Kings story is brought to the screen with great elegance and excitement. It is an extraordinary motion that people will be talking about in 50 or 100 years.positive,one of the films that you must watch in lifetime. A film about long-term imprisonment that takes its time to convey what the slow crawl of a lifers existence might feel like. Thoroughly gripping and pretty refreshing. Ten years ago The Shawshank Redemption was a low-key prison film that didnt recoup its costs. Slowly it has become one of the most popular movies of all time - and for some it has even been life- changing. It is a strange comment to make about a film set inside a prison but The Shawshank Redemption creates a warm hold on our feelings because it makes us a member of a family. Many movies offer us vicarious experiences and quick superficial emotions. Shawshank slows down and looks. It uses the narrators calm observant voice to include us in the story of men who have formed a community behind bars. It is deeper than most filmspositive,One of the classic movie ever made. Lots of enthusiasm is shown in the movie apart from all the suffering prisoners have to face. Must watch movie. Still capturing the box office. Shawshank is a true story and a must watch for any new member. Tim Robbins has done a fantastic job including Morgan Freeman. The Story line of the movie is really more biased then any other top bench marking movie. Stephen Kings story is brought to the screen with great elegance and excitement. It is an extraordinary motion that people will be talking about in 50 or 100 years.No action no special effects - just men in prison uniforms talking to each other. The Shawshank Redemption and To Kill a Mockingbird are the best movies I have ever seen. I do not judge it by its technical merits - I dont really care about that. I have read that Citizen Kane or The Godfather or this or that movie is the best movie ever made. They may have the best technique or be the most influential motion pictures ever made but not the best. The best movies are ones that touch the soul. It takes a movie like The Shawshank Redemption to touch the soul.positive,One of the best stories on film. Acting cinematography... its all in there. A must see. A piece of our history as filmmakers. This story is compelling as you feel for each characters deep struggles within a community of inmates. A range of characters excite the plot with its unexpected culture as an intimate story unfolds of secrets shame struggle and finally triumph. Morgan Freeman deserves an Oscar for his amazing performance and Tim Robbins executes his character flawlessly as Andy Dufresne a man of clever who navigates his way through a sharp turn to a new way of life. This story isnt missing a morsel and keeps you on the edge of your seat with mystery murder and the element of surprise. The Shawshank Redemption shares the ranks of the best feature screenplay I have ever read. It read unlike any other and was the kind you cant put down. Saving Private Ryan comes in at a close second. Frank Darabont is a hell of a writer and is also credited with The Green Mile and developed The Walking Dead series.positive,one of the best new movies to have come around in a long while its definitely my favorite angelina movie by far she was exceptional in her role she made me love maleficent before maleficent was just some character in an old disney princess movie that really made me feel nothing for her at all this film brings maleficent to wonderful life she is honestly now one of my most favorite characters of all time this is definitely not like any disney princess movie if thats what you may be thinking its dark and beautiful and if it wasnt blatant about being disney you might not even know this film is definitely worth a watch it has taken a place on my favorite movies list for surepositive,One of the best movies that i have ever seen.It truly transcends time and is an epic in all proportions.People just dont make movies like this anymore and this is one of my favorite movies of all time. The movie is About Andy Dufranea banker who has been wrongfully acquitted of killing his wife in cold blood and send to shaw shank prison.the movie shows the various hardships faced by Andy and how he does not give up hope and carries on with patience and finally becomes free. the climax is absolutely spellbinding and will leave you aghast.it is a truly great movie and i was aghast at finding out that this movie was a failure in the box office.BUT NOW ALMOST EVERYONE RECOGNIZES THIS MOVIE FOR WHAT IT TRULY IS - A MASTERPIECE OF STORYTELLING.positive,One of the Best movies ive ever seenit is the best work of Tarantino. Interlocking different stories into one with black humor action and thriller are some greatest qualities of this awesome movie. Its an anthology that blends three stories and 12 principal characters into a mesmerizing mosaic of the Los Angeles scuzz world. The acting is dynamite: John TravoltaSamuel Jackson Bruce Willis gave very good performance.Even Tarantinos role was quite good. Pulp Fiction is ferocious fun without a trace of cautioncomplacency or political correctness to inhibit its 153 deliciously lurid minutes.You will find humoractionthrillersuspense and new sense of continuum in this movie.positive,One of the best movie series I have seen in a while. This one is though by far my favorite. Not just the ending but the final battle as well. Through all the movies you see the struggles that each character especially Frodo goes through. And to see in the end such a remarkable battle followed by Frodo and Bilbo leaving together on the boatpositive,One of the best movie I have watched ever Not once stopped my breath when I watching all 3 parts for the first time. I could not wait to get herring and the next.. I like it because it has used imaginative and beautiful places. I really like movies made Š— Š— by words. Especially when it comes to humanity and its survival The beauty of nature is very well shown and the evil forces of darkness. Moments in which people come together and trust each other are ostentation of goodness Soon I have not seen a film like this and I think that it is not made Š— Š— yet Why Ima very good producers and I am sure that soon something will come very impressive as The Lord of the Ringspositive,One of the best from comics. Dark Knight dont even find words to explain the beauty of movie... just excellent. The Dark Knight is a 2008 superhero crime thriller film directed and co-written by Christopher Nolan. Based on the DC Comics character Batman the film is part of Nolans Batman film series and a sequel to 2005s Batman Begins. Christian Bale reprises the lead role. The film follows Bruce Wayne/Batman Bale District Attorney Harvey Dent/Two-Face Aaron Eckhart Assistant D.A. Rachel Dawes Maggie Gyllenhaal and Police Commissioner James Gordon Gary Oldman and their struggles and journey in combating the new rising threat of a criminal who goes by the name of the Joker Heath Ledger. Nolans inspiration for the film was the Jokers comic book debut in 1940 and the 1996 series The Long Halloween which retold Two-Faces origin. The Dark Knight was filmed primarily in Chicago as well as in several other locations in the United States the United Kingdom and Hong Kong. Nolan used an IMAX camera to film some sequences including the Jokers first appearance in the film. On January 22 2008 after he had completed filming The Dark Knight Heath Ledger died from a toxic combination of prescription drugs leading to intense attention from the press and movie-going public. Warner Bros. had initially created a viral marketing campaign for The Dark Knight developing promotional websites and trailers highlighting screen shots of Ledger as the Joker but after Ledgers death the studio refocused its promotional campaign.positive,One of the best and must watch movie which i ever enjoyed....Shawshank encompasses friendships hardships hopes and dreams. And what is so great about the movie is that it moves you it gives you hope. Even though the circumstances between the characters and the viewers are quite different you dont feel that far removed from what the characters are going through. It is a simple film yet it has an everlasting message. Frank Darabont didnt need to put any kind of outlandish special effects to get us to love this film the narration and the acting does that for him. Why this movie didnt win all seven Oscars is beyond me but dont let that sway you to not see this film let its ranking on the IMDbs top 250 list sway you let your friends recommendation about the movie sway you. Set aside a little over two hours tonight and rent this movie. You will finally understand what everyone is talking about and you will understand why this is my all time favorite movie.positive,one of the aspects of the movie that is very interesting growing up in a broken family mason lives constant stressful interactions with his parents and stepfathers many times adults are in their own world and they have little empathy he doesnt like it he has to cope on the other hand he has very nice moments with his father who tries hard to be the best parent he can be the mother tries too but it is a different story also we see some nice family gatherings beautiful movie that makes the audience experience the process of growing up richard linklater took twelve years to shoot this film this is breakthrough something that has never done beforetruly a master piecepositive,One of my favorite movies everThe Shawshank Redemption is a modern day classic as it tells the story of two inmates who become friends and find solace over the years in which this movie takes place.Based on a Stephen King novelthis movie makes us feel different watching this film than most others as this is an incredibly realistic film.Tim Robbins stars as Andy Dufresne who is convicted of murder and Morgan Freeman as Ellis Boyd Red Redding who is a fellow inmate and close friend of Dufresne and Bob Gunton as Warden Samuel Norton who is the Warden of Shawshank State Prison and is a character who has mixed feelings and emotions towards everyone around him and a character who is sometimes easy to like and at other times easy to despise.This film is easily considered one of the greatest films of all time and I definitely agree with this fact.It was nominated for seven Academy Awards including Best Picture Best Actor Š—– Morgan Freeman Best Adapted Screenplay Best Cinematography Best Editing Best Original  and Best Sound but didnt win any due to tough competition from the film Forrest Gump.I personally think that Tim Robbins should have been nominated for the Best Actor award as he really gave the performance of his career.Bravo to this brilliant modern day classicpositive,One of my all time favorites. Shawshank Redemption is a very moving story about hope and the power of friendship. The cast is first rate with everyone giving a great performance. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman carry the movie but Bob Gunton and Clancy Brown are perfect as the Warden Norton and prison guard captain Hadley respectively. And James Whitmores portrail of an elderly inmate Brooks is moving. The screenplay gives almost every actor at least one or more memorable lines through out the film. As well as a very surprising twist near the end that almost knocked me out of my chair. If you have not seen this movie rent it or better yet buy it. As I bet youll want to see this one more than once.positive,One of most hyped movies ever and it lived up to all expectations The best super hero movie you will ever see. Christopher Nolan is known for his big blockbusters. The Dark Knight Is his masterpiece. Christian Bale plays the dark tortured Batman that Gothom and viewers deserve. His supporting cast is magnificent as well. Michael Caine Aaron Eckhart Maggie Gyllenhaal Gary Oldman and Morgan Freeman seemed to be made for their respective roles. All of them pitched in perfectly to the storyline to enhance everyone experience Eckart was the perfect face of Gothom in Harvey Dent. His story is well developed on top of the obvious Batman storyline. Eckhart transformed into the most riveting Two Face the Batman movies have encountered. The best acting in the movie is BY FAR Heath Ledger as the Joker. Never before has the joker been seen as this dark unpredictable and ruthless. Ledger puts on a performance of a lifetime His performance alone is a reason to see this film. The storyline was much better developed than other Batman movies as well. Nolan did a fantastic job with taking the original storyline and developing it into a plot that can contain so many elements and characters. When you put all of these aspects together on top of the entertaining action effects and Batman gadgets that everyone expects you get a masterpiece.positive,ONE OF BEST MOVIES IN THE WORLD HISTORY AND ABSOLUTELY MY ANOTHER MOST FAVOURITE MOVIE OF ALL TIME The unforgettable movie based on a trilogy novel about which most people agree that its as satisfying as the novel. Peter Jackson has successfully made this Middle Earth History become real I also give a credit to J.R.R. Tolkien for his wonderful novel Lord of the Rings and The Hobbits he has amazingly created a story that feels like a real part of the world history What an outstanding imagination All actors and actresses have wonderfully given their best in this perfect until every detail epic movie we really feel their chemistry one to another. This is also a movie that worthy and enjoyable to watch again and again from which we still get something new even when we watch it for 12th times either a new value or a scene we might have no longer remembered. One of best parts of the trilogy I fell in love with Elijah Wood after watching its final one The Return of the Kingpositive,One couldnt help be sceptical of the hype surrounding The Dark Knight before having seen it scepticism was certainly weighing on my mind as i walked into the cinema. I couldnt help thinking is this going to be as amazing as expected or is the hype just an inevitable reaction to the death of Heath Ledger I can safely say to anyone still having not seen The Dark Knightpositive,One action scene after another And action is putting it lightly.You will sit on the front of your seat the entire movie. When you think you can sit back for a breather BAM Another action scene even bigger than the one before it. After this movie is over is the only time you will be able to sit back and relax. The faint of heart should not watch this one. Nolan has made an enormously profitable smash with the Batman franchise but at the risk of sounding priggish I cant help thinking it may be a bit of a career blind-alley for the talented director who gave us brilliant and disquieting movies like Following 1998 and Memento 2000 whose inventions still linger in the mind. The Dark Knights massive box-office success has surely given Nolan the means to write his own cheque and in addition something sweeter still - clout. I hope that he will use it to cultivate movies that are smaller and more manoeuvrable than that great armoured Batmobile.positive,One - word Tarantino   In far 1994 as you know there was a decent number of very interesting and qualitative movies such as: Escape from Shawshank Frank Darabont Leon Luc Besson Forest Gump of Robert Zemekis  Transfer of all these pictures can borrow much it is a lot of lines but it is most from listed above in my opinion Quentin Tarantinos movie Š—” Pulp fiction In due time this picture made furor both on critics and on film fans The movie received the Oscar for the best scenario was nominated for sets of awards and in general is recognized as one of the best criminal tapes when or removed Why Š—” it received this rank In my opinion it occurred from Š—” for courageous approach to violence impudent talks and the extraordinary scenario written by the director Tarantino managed to make simply cult movie which it is possible to reconsider one hundred times of a weak and simple plot To Tarantino anybody such didnt do anything and infinite imitations from which I can distinguish Cards went then the money two trunks Guy Ricci and Barry Zonenfelda though even they near Reading matter are destroyed About actors conversations are absolutely excessive after all everything likely is already told to me John Travolta Sam Jackson Uma Thurman Bruce Willis Tim Roth Harvey Keitel Christopher Walken and great and awful Quentin Tarantino Š—” everything coped with the roles unbelievable My result Pulp fiction Š—” the movie simply phenomenal before it cheerful interesting and extraordinary Above any estimatespositive,Once again Peter Jackson proofed that hes one of the best visionary directors of his time. The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King is yet another masterpiece. Frodo and Sam tight their bonds so they can together cast the One Ring into the Mountain of Doom. With a lot of pathos action and emotional scenes The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King combines every feature that movie should have. Excellent music from Howard Shore only suits this movie up - great brasses violins and other string sections will make you cry even after tenth showing. Its long. In extended edition it has over 4 hours of watching but believe me you wont even blink an eye. Peter Jackson doesnt make a mistake like other directors that are basing on books. Some moments are mixed like PJ wanted but the movie grip strong to the book. In my last words I want to say that The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King is a must-see position on your watchlist. Its an incredible masterpiece that take my breath after almost ten years of watching.positive,On Lord of the Rings in general: This is how film making should be done this beautifully woven piece of cinema deserves all the praise and attention it gets it is truly a labour of love and care the tremendous amount of effort put into these films makes it a must see for anyone wanting to see how a big budget fantasy blockbuster SHOULD BE MADE Theres nothing bad about this film and if there is then people would be looking for things that are bad and thats just knit picking. Everything from the writing casting acting production design art cinematography lighting music sound EVERYTHING is spot on with this these films. On this film in particular: The best of the three thats right this is the first time I have watched a trilogy/ sequel and can put my hand on my heart and say that these films get better as they go along mainly because it reaches the ultimate climax it possibly can without losing any momentum and steam from the first films and has the best pay off you could ask for changes have been made from the books of course but every change Jackson has made from Tolkiens novels is completely justified for its use in a cinematic context I honestly cried at the end of this film and thats not an easy task for me to get me as invested in this world and its characters as Jacksons trilogy has well lets just say it takes a lot only Pixar has achieved the same with me and Ill be lucky if any other film is capable of making me do so again. What is there more to say a beautifully made film with a wonderfully dramatic climax you really do get the feeling of being on a journey with these films you feel enticed with the characters as they embark on it and for a 3 hour film to do so without losing any momentum as with all three of them well thats an achievement in itself. It honestly deserved every award it got and then some.positive,On every level acting photography sound costumes direction and plot you are absorbed into the story. It is as fresh today as the day I saw it in the Cinema and has yet to be bettered in its genre. You as the audience believe that the actors arent merely reciting the dialogue but have become each character they represent. Peter Jackson could so have easily followed the blockbuster formula to conclude the film with an epic battle but we are respected as fellow members of the story/crew and given the entirety of the story. Though it completes the story I was very unhappy it had to end as you want to know what happens next over all the leading characters lifetimes. This is a totally outstanding epic which will be enjoyed for decades to come.positive,On a Winters weekend when I was Six my family and I having not seen a LOTR film before watched the Trilogy. And yes it deserves a capital. Then I watched it for the battles the epic battles. Now I watch it for the story nostalgia and of course the battles. I have watched each of the Trilogy many many times. Ive watched them in the car on an old portable DVD player that only lasted two hours and Ive watched them on each of the three TVs my family has owned in the last nine years. Ive grown up with the films and the games of the films the top trumps and the knock-offs of the films. Nothing can replicate the plot or the spectacle I know but something to remind me of them is enough. And I am therefore finally reading the books Yes Im looking forward to the Hobbit trilogy note no capital not yet at least. but I am always looking back at LOTR.positive,Okay this title is the key for Tarantino in the movies. The storyline is perfect the conclusion may be sad but in fact its the life indeed. The action in the movie have strong scenes showing the life of a bounty hunter in the new ages. The movies can be difficult to people who do not like a detailed story showing the every details of all action/dialogs etc. If youre not a fan of the cult films may be this title is not for you. But if you are a big fan of the cult films just like me well this movie was made Š— Š— for you To watch this you must know some rules the end is the begging and vice versa. And what do I mean Well in the Tarantinos style of making films he dont start with the begin of the plotpositive,OK. So 4 hrs after all the adds and the previews... without a bathroom break break was really long. And yes it was hot and crowded. Yes the lineup was an hour and 30 mins long and yes my butt was really really sore. It was all worth it. What was started 3 years ago is over. Finally No. Im going to miss the excitement of seeing what comes next even through I already knew the bottom line is that this was a great finale to one of the greatest epics of our time. Go out. See it with your kids. Introduce them to movie making the way it should always be. Enjoy. 10/10positive,ok after a very long waiting for the bluray today i watched the movie first of all ill guarantee you that this is a must watch movie for scifi lovers the runtime is long and someone can think this is boring but i must tell you that watch this movie till the end actually i can say that its a journey that you feel to the core all the credits must go for the plot and the best director like all of them said the plot is completely pure also must say that hans zimmer done a fantastic job all over the movie and with a pure plot and nolans directing + hans zimmers music its a high class weapon that can attack you heavily christopher nolan this movie showed us what you can do and its very clear that you made your life immortalpositive,Often said to be one of the best films of all time I cant help but agree. No matter how many times I watch this over I feel like it never bores me and I am always captivated in a way that Ive never felt with any other film before. The Shawshank Redemption is a tale of hope courage and betrayal seen through the eyes of prison inmates Andy played by Tim Robbins and older convict Red portrayed by Morgan Freeman in an Oscar nominated performance. The film is set over 19 years in Shawshank prison and depicts the life of Andy Dufresne a hotshot banker and his struggle with keeping his mind and his sanity whilst serving time for a crime he didnt commit. As Andy has to put up with harassment distress and affliction throughout the duration of his time at the prison the film illustrates a tale of eternal hope. As time slowly passes in the prison hes assisted by an older inmate by the name of Red Redding Morgan Freeman a black marketer who is known to locate certain things from time to time. As the years pass by Andys friendship with Red grows and so do the hardships they have to overcome. The film itself has touched me in many ways it shows me just what people can do when they have a little faith and keep incessant hope no matter what. Obviously Stephen Kings greatest and most memorable big screen interpretation one of which he is almost certainly proud of. The movie is a timeless classic that speaks to me and probably a lot of others on so many levels providing a near perfect film with a great plot line and representing a storyline with an even better message. Tim Robbins delivers an enthralling performance as the titular character one that certainly stands out throughout the film whereas Morgan Freemans interpretation of fellow convict Red is just as captivating earning him recognition from the academy but not his fellow co-star Robbins obviously yet another Oscar snub. Overall the Shawshank Redemption speaks out to its audience as it shows a tale of perseverance and perpetual hope when in the midst of the struggles in life. The film itself is possibly my favourite of all time and manages to keep my attention on the 10th time of watching it. A must-see for anyone who has a good taste in films and is looking for a movie that will change their perspective on life and give them the hope to pull through in the darkest of times.positive,Of all the movies I must say that this had the best visual effects. This was my most beloved book and to see it come to life on screen was absolutely amazing. Peter Jackson once again worked his magic. The characters are still as amazing as ever. Legolas has incredible stunts that make you want to stand up and cheer. Eowyn becomes a hero. Merry and Pippin arent up to there usual mischief. Gandalf is as awesome as ever. Aragorn is a very important role in the film. Gimli still brings some comic relief into the film. And Arwen is still as fair as ever. This film is a must see by all lovers of Tolkien although you must expect to see a few scenes missing the Houses of Healing the Scouring of the Shire and a couple others. It goes without saying that Peter Jackson brought home the gold with this one...literally. He won best director at the Golden Globes and the film won Best Dramatic Film at the Golden Globes. Now they need to bring home the little bald guy Oscars on February 29 2004. Film rating: 10/10positive,Îâ - I love you Pumpkin - I love you too Honey Bunny ÎŽ Pulp Fiction is a cult and timeless film because based on a director with a unique treatment of cinema Quentin Tarantino has a real talent for turning the violence in derision so that even the dramatic moments are hilarious Actors including John Travolta Uma Thurman Samuel L Jackson and Bruce Willis play wonderfully and its soundtrack is really great The fact that the film focuses on the stories of several characters intersect at one time or another is interesting and original Moreover the dialogues are memorable and the story is very fascinating Besides we can almost say that all scenes are cult scene cheeseburger the dance scene the scene of the cellar Finally I would say it is essential for any movie buff : a head of workpositive,Occasionally you go into a cinema and all the films you wanted to see were full. As youve come this far and youre a bit of a film fan you go to see a film youve heard nothing about. I did this 6 years ago with expectations low and a boredom threshold to match I sat and waited to be disappointed. 2 hours later I walked out of the cinema a different person before I had not been moved by a film I didnt care if : Indiana Jones made it Sonny Corleone got wacked Fred married Ginger ET got home. Before films were either plot driven or character driven they were action or comedy sad or happy a few came along that combined a number of facets that I enjoyed respected or challenged how I viewed an issue or a person. Shawshank was different there were characters I believed not just one or two but virtually all. Throughout the first hour I was gripped the full range of emotions were explored the second hour building on the characters was even more powerful some characters came and went but ultimately this was a story of 2 people: Red and Andy. I have never seen a film that so eloquently and beautifully illustrates friendship and hope. This has become the benchmark by which I judge all movies. I am pleased that I am not alone in feeling this way. I am glad that it did not win oscars as I feel individual endorsement is stronger than any vested interest award ceremony I relish telling everyone this is my favourite film. I have seen it many times and will see it many more.positive,Now Im aware the Lord of The Rings is three movies but in my eyes it is one giant movie and story. They next one also picks up right where the other left off. Here we go the review of Peter Jacksons epic trilogy The Lord of The Rings. Lord of the Rings is a trilogy of books written a long time ago by J.R.R. Tolkien and it is the most clich’© story of good vs. evil. The story is stereotypical but it works. Tolkien created his own world of Middle-Earth and it is filled with different races and languages. In the beginning magic rings were made but there was one ring made of pure evil one ring to rule them all. The maker of this ring was named Sauron and long story short he was defeated but survived through the ring. The ring passed from person to person and it ended up in the hands of a hobbit named Frodo Baggins. He has been chosen to destroy the one ring before the armies of Sauron destroy Middle-Earth. The storyline is very clich’©. It is a good vs. evil story of epic proportions. If you think you have seen this before you have but this is completely different. The little guy saves the day and nobody expected the hobbit with hairy feet to defeat the dark lord. One of the major aspects of this movie is the relationships between characters. Gandalfs relationship with Frodo and the ring. Frodos relationship with Sam Gollum and the Ring. Gollums relationship with the ring. Merrys relationship with Pippin. All of these relationships drive this movie. Nothing is more powerful then the relationship between Frodo and Sam. Samwise Gamgee is more than Frodos best friend he is basically his protector. Sam acts as a barrier between the evil of the ring. Frodo could not have survived without Sam and the roots of this trilogy are the relationship between Frodo and Sam. Sauron has all the power of persuasion power of armies fear and all the power in the world. The only thing more powerful is the love and friendship between two young hobbits who take on this evil power. Coming in second with relationships is between Gollum and the Ring. Think about it Gollum spent more time with the Ring than anybody else excluding its master Sauron. Gollum lived with this ring for 500 years. It literally poisoned his mind and turned him into a gangly creature that you cant help but pity. He is easily my favorite character with his complexity and how it isnt his fault that he is the way he is. He is obsessed with the ring and calls it his precious. Any fan of these movies knows what Im talking about. Over the span of three movies the audience gets their favorite characters and sees them develop. Gimli and Legolas didnt like each other at first because one was a dwarf and the other an elf. I never thought Id die side by side with an elf Gimli says in the final battle. How about side by side with a friend Legolas answers. These two against all odds became friends and were inseparable. You also see Merry and Pippin evolve into something I know I did not expect. In the first movie they were silly and na’Àve but in the second movie Merry begins to understand the dangers of the world and that it needs saving. Pippin matures a bit late but nevertheless they are two of my favorite characters. These three movies are filled with incredible action scenes and special effects. From Hobbiton to Rivendell to Helms Deep and all the way to the Crack of Doom every place in Middle-Earth comes to life. The designers of these sets and CGI went into extreme detail and any fan of the movie should check out the six discs of special features. You learn how Hobbiton was actually dug out in a hill in the ground in New Zealand. My favorite battle has to be the battle of Helms Deep. It was 10000 Uruk-hai vs. around 500 men and elves fighting at a castle that has defended the country of Rohan for centuries. Aragorn falls into his place as a leader and he develops into the man he needs to be in the third movie. These movies are made with incredible detail with every movie being made at once. Peter Jackson and his cast and crew spent 15 months in New Zealand and filmed this masterpiece. Costumes were made and WETA Workshop made all of the sets they needed and used miniatures and made the world of Middle-Earth come alive. Actors took the books and looked for details fans would look for from the books. The only real problem with these movies is that if you dont know the story you cannot really enjoy the full experience. I saw the first movie when I was really young and I had no idea what it was about and I had to see the movies many many times before I knew what was going on. As soon as I did I was hooked and now I know almost everything there is to know about these movies. Overall The Lord of the Rings is possibly the best trilogy ever made. The way the filmmakers dove into the world of Middle-Earth with such detail is commendable. This movie won so many awards made a bunch of money and it deserves everything it got. These are movie that need to be seen by anybody who even remotely likes the books and even if you dont go in pay attention and join the experience. Lord of The Rings is my favorite movie next to Titanic and gets the WillyT Seal of Approval.positive,Now I see what everybody was talking about. It took me 4 years to see this in my opinion masterpiece. If you have not seen this movie rent it anyway you can. The performances delivered by Robbins and Freeman are to me the pinnacle of both their careers. This film cannot help but evoke tactile imagery to the fullest capacity. You feel what the main characters are going through the sensation is uncanny. Robbins Andy and Freeman Red are a balance of the human spirit. Andy is your freedom-seeking hope side and Red is your rational pessimistic counterpart. Find your equilibrium in The Shawshank Redemption.  Aragorn turns to his men and says For Frodo....then little Merry and Pippin run full speed. I have seen this film easily by itself about 15 times as a trilogy roughly 10 times. From Shelobs layer to the battle of Minas Tirith it doesnt leave much to be desired JRR Tolkein did a fantastic job writing the book and Peter Jackson did an amazing job portraying it to the big screen. If youve yet to see LOTR watch it from the start and really take notice of everything because it has a lot to offer if you like being told a story. Excellent 10/10 positive,Now here we are with the big one. The film that is often called the best film of the decade. The gigantic mass of epic known as The Lord of the Rings: Return of the King. Everyone looks at this film as the best. In fact not only the best but the best by far is what people consider this film to be. It was nominated for 11 Oscars including best picture and won every Oscar it was nominated for. It was a huge success and yes this film is fantastic. It is one of the biggest adventures I have ever seen. Everything that was great in the first two are great here also. The writing visuals acting are all top notch stuff. So is it the best in the trilogy Well I consider all 3 to stand together as one huge film experience. If any one of them didnt exist the others wouldnt be as good. All of them standing together give us a complete and epic adventure. 4 stars out of 4positive,Now after about 9 and a half years after we first watched The lord of the rings: the return of the king I and my friends decided to have a Tolkien movie marathon watching The lord of the rings trilogy and The hobbit. As much as i adore Tolkiens book and Jacksons movies this is my absolute favorite. This is it you now THE war Saurons fall and Aragorn becoming king. The top of the movie the absolute thrill is the arrival of the dead commanded by Aragorn and its just a joyful felling watching them through Minas Tirith killing orcs. The cast is great but my favorite is Sir Ian Mckellan. I thin he should have won an Oscar for this role. Hope that The Hobbit 2 and 3 will be better. Absolute success for Jackson for that he has found inspiration in Tolkiens book cause i dont think anybody else would have given us movies and cast as good as it is now.. so for that BRAVO Cantt wait for the second Hobbit movie :ppositive,Not really a lot you can you say about this film that hasnt already been said. One of my all time favourite films. How Morgan Freeman didnt get a best supporting Oscar for this film Ill never figure out. Wonderful amazingly written film. The cast are superb Tim Robins always underrated as an actor. Pulls you through every emotion. If you havent seen this film then you you dont know what youve been missing. A must have for any movie buff. It didnt do so well at the box office but this movies reputation has grown over the years through word of mouth showings on television and then of course along came the video then DVD rentals.positive,Not only the greatest story ever told but what and ending Easily one of the best battle scenes to be seen and Im not talking about Minas Tirith either Im talking about at the gates of Mordorpositive,Not only is this film one of the most touching I have ever seen it also has one of the most unexpected and inspiring endings I have ever seen. The bond that grows between the two main characters is unforgettable and the  is the best Ive heardpositive,not my favorite film of all time but i think it is probably the last great movie of the decade sure the movie is SUPER COOL but it also happens to be fine filmmaking some people cuddle up to brain candy movies like forrest gump because they think a feel good movie is the only kind of emotionally compelling type of film out there there are other emotions to evoke besides sympathy or just plain ol garden variety sob-fest there are also movies which disturb you incite you etc pulp fiction is such a movie besides its got SUPER COOL dialogue and an ensemble cast that kicks @$$ everyone is at their best and havent topped those performances since i might add except for travolta in battlefield earth that was supposed to be sarcastic by the way bruce willis proves he can act to the world and very well too some of us already knew it and how can you not like a movie with a scene in which a hit man slams a gigantic needle into the chest of the wife of a mob boss who has overdosed on heroine how can you beat that 10/10 all the way babypositive,Not many people I knew of had confidence in Peter Jackson when it was announced he would be bringing these movies to life 11 years ago. Me and my friends all loved Heavenly Creatures and Bad Taste is fun to watch but we werent confident in Jacksons ability to make a blockbuster based off a book series I love to death. HappilyI was wrong when we saw The Fellowship Of The Ring in theaters. I found to be a successful Tolkien adaptation and a great film in its own right. The Two Towers came and went and I was feeling confident about the final chapter in this epic trilogy. Then came the day. I went to my nearest theater bought snacks plopped into my seat and had to datethe greatest film experience of all time. I literally sat in my seat not wanting to leave Middle-Earth behind when the credits finished. The Adaptation was incredible. Parts that felt odd in the book flowed better in the movieand changes were made that I still dont complain about. The Acting was stellar the highlights being Elijah Wood Sean Astin Viggo Mortensen Ian McKellan and Bernard Hill. The chills that went through me during the Rohirrims charge the quiet explanation of death the entire climax at The Cracks of Doom and Frodo leaving forever deserve to be hailed as some of the greatest moments in film history period. The Music Sound and Visuals still hold up to date which to me says something. Now as We wait for further news of the next Peter Jackson movies detailing more adventures in the lands of Middle-Earth we should take the time to look back onto why this is even possible. Thank you Peter Jackson for making something that cant be ignored.positive,Not many movies have come out that make me stand up and cheer but Pulp Fiction definitely did just that Quentin Tarantino put together a movie with great characters an interesting intelligent storyline and Pulp Fiction set the standard for an entire genre of movies The way of the gun two days in the valley Nothing has come close to the theatrical genius of Pulp Fictionpositive,Not many films can retain a certain air of gravitas without alienating the common movie goer. Though Nolan can be slated for making cerebral films that are dumbed down so that many can get it it is my belief that this is entirely a meritable ability. With the Dark Knight we see the clever story lines that Nolan has become known for become fleshed out with enough action and thrilling suspense that there is no point where boredom starts to creep in. The characters still are believable enough that this film could take place within our modern day society. Unlike the usual Batman films which have been slightly camp affairs with characters that are bound to fiction Nolan manages to keep the Joker just real enough that the audience fears what he will do next. Every watch of this film highlights the depths to which every actor in this film went and most of all how developed Ledgers Joker was. I am not an entirely unbiased critic and me saying that I use this film as a comparison for most other films with Ledgers Joker in my mind being the perfect acting performance should be taken with a pinch of salt though I believe this film to be one of the stand out creations of our generation.  music visuals script and acting. These elements each equally important must succeed independently yet still form a harmonious union because this mixture determines the fate of the artists opus. Though already well known amongst his colleagues for his notable skills at writing and directing Frank Darabont emerges with his feature film directorial debut The Shawshank Redemption. Proving himself already a master of the craft Darabont managed to create one of the most recognizable independent releases in the history of Hollywood. The Shawshank Redemption defines a genre defies the odds compels the emotions and brings an era of artistically influential films back to Hollywood. The story begins with the trial of a young banker Andy Dufrense victimized by circumstantial evidence resulting in a conviction for the murder of his wife and her lover. After a quick conviction Andy finds himself serving a life sentence at Shawshank prison with no hope of parole. He exists in this prison only in appearance keeping his mind free from the drab walls around him. His ability to do this results in the gaining of respect from his fellow inmates but most of all from Ellis Redding. Ellis commonly referred to as Red finds gainful use of his entrepreneurial spirit within the drab walls of Shawshank by dealing in contraband and commodities rare to the confines of prison. Andys demeanor and undeniable sense of hope causes Red to take a deeper look at himself and the world around him. Andy proves to Red and the other inmates that in the conventional walls of Shawshank prison convention will find no home in his lifestyle. By creating the films firm foundation the meticulously chiseled screenplay paved the way for this films success. Frank Darabont outdoes himself with the phenomenal adaptation of Stephen Kings equally noteworthy novella Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption. In this novella King demonstrates that he can break free from the genre he dominates and still create a marvelous piece of modern literature. Though the film mirrors the novella in many ways Darabont illustrates a focused objective of improving upon the areas where the novella came up short resulting in one of the best book to film transitions ever. While maintaining some of the poetic and moving dialogue of the novella Darabont also proves that a films  can generate a great deal of emotional response from its audience as dialogue does. He employs the cunning Thomas Newman son of the legendary Hollywood composer Alfred Newman. Darabont shows recognition for the films needs by employing Newman who makes the gentle piano chords whisper softly to the viewer as if a part of the scripted dialogue. Newman lends himself to individualism and tends to drive more towards the unique in the realm of  composition. His effort in Shawshank did not go unnoticed as his  received an Oscar nomination in 1995. While unique and independent Newmans  never once intrudes on your concentration or distracts from the film. With work from vast array of talented scene designers costume designers composers cinematographers and various other Hollywood artists the cast of The Shawshank Redemption had a strong foundation to work with. The marvelous cast of this film will dazzle you with some of the most convincing performances you will witness in a film. While both Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman shine as Andy and Red respectively the true spectacle of acting lies within the plethora of amazing supporting actors who easily disappear into their roles. Most noticeable of these the veteran film star James Whitmore who portrays the elderly Brooks Hatlen. Brooks a man incarcerated for an unmentioned crime for so long that he finds himself attached to the Shawshank and the daily life he has lead. Each of these actors show a true dedication to their art and a focused purpose in their motivations creating a convincing setting that never once caters to anything unbelievable. With all of the aesthetic touches and attention to cinematic detail the most beautiful part of the film lies within its thematic material such as its focus on the human desires for the most abstract concepts like hope and freedom. These themes which concern things the human spirit undoubtedly yearns for seem so intricately woven into the plot that it easily draws its audience in to its story. Though full of hardened criminals your heart will go out to these men as they display the most basic of human emotions and deliver some of the most quotable lines in a film to date. Like a great novel this film manages to succeed at greater things than simply entertaining an audience. Darabont tells his story most masterfully illustrating principles and inspiring his audience to think. He leaves us a poignant film with a powerful message of hope and redemption something we all seek. This film manages to redeem Hollywood in the eyes of people who feared it long lost in a dark sea of clich’©s and predictability. Darabont shows us that artists still work in the Hollywood studios and production facilities. These artists show their capability to produce art  real art that inspires you to look at the deeper aspects of life and the world around you. The Shawshank Redemption delivers much-needed breath of fresh air for anyone who realizes the capability of film. It proves that masters of the craft still live on this earth and still bless us with timeless masterpieces that we will never forget.positive,Not being a huge fan of superhero movies I didnt have much expectations for Batman Begins. However viewing the 2005 Christopher Nolan production I was pleasantly shocked. Then after my huge expectations for The Dark Knight Christopher Nolan blew my expectations to the dust. Will the same happen with the 3rd and last film The Dark Knight Rises Quite simply Yes My big expectations were once again blown away. What a production This is a true cinematic experience to behold. The movie exceeded my expectations in terms of action and entertainment. The editing sound  visuals direction and action are all top notch. This movie is amazing. It is interesting like all of Batman are. When the end of the movie comes you start to turn surprised and you do not hope that. Although this is the best thing of that movies. Im in love with them. I do not know when this movie ends you are like: oh my god really it just happened There are no words to explain the feeling this movie causes in you. I love it. I suggest this movie to all the fiction lovers like me. You gonna love this movie. Seriously.positive,Normally a summer blockbuster this huge can never for some reason deliver on both acting and the usual crazy action. Most of what happens in this movie is pretty bad and i mean bad. But i am not going to spoil that for you. I have never seen a movie as brilliant as this. Every scene in the movie has to be there for if you wood just scrap it the movie would somehow collapse because there is a bit of information the audience did not get. And I have to say that this Christopher Nolan batman franchise is really up there for me with star wars Indiana Jones and THE LORD OF THE RINGS. This story really tells you why the joker is who he is and why batman becomes who he must become. Because this joker is all about destruction and chaos. Really looking forward to the dark knight rises.positive,Nolans directing is sublime the pacing of the movie was so well kept managing to keep the audience enthralled in an almost 3 hour movie. There were several shots in the film that had me saying Now how in the hell did they do that Brilliant s by James Newton Howard and Hans Zimmer. Every actor shines no one person steals the film. I dont want to say much about it because whatever is said cannot do it justice there is enough hype surrounding its release but its there for a reason. Top Notch film. Bravo to Nolan and his crew for giving a movie that Batman truly deserves.Brilliant s by James Newton Howard and Hans Zimmer. Every actor shines no one person steals the film. I dont want to say much about it because whatever is said cannot do it justice there is enough hype surrounding its release but its there for a reason. Top Notch film. Bravo to Nolan and his crew for giving a movie that Batman truly deserves.positive,Nolan returns to the helm of what many consider the perfect Batman film. Bale Caine Oldman Freeman Murphy and McFarlane all reprise their roles spectacularly and flawlessly without upstaging one another nor their performances from Begins. Holmes is replaced with Gyllenhaal who look nothing alike but the story itself is too strong to be setback by a recast. Heath Ledger portrays the most chaotic and theatrical -- yet most convincing memorable and realistic -- Joker to date. The Joker is as amusing as he is intimidating and will stop at nothing. Ledgers role isnt as pronounced as Nicholsons was in the 1989 film which is actually a stronger move because it avoids any upstaging. Hans Zimmers wonderful muddling  just adds to The Jokers prominence. Eckhart makes Harvey Dent his own. Nolan succeeds in continuing an absolutely plausible take on a renewed Batman seriesŠ—_ its almost too real for some people. Its conservative undertones can be excused for its moral depth. **** out of four  from the cinematography to the acting the casting the writing...everything. Its a fantastic example of the power of hope and the true nature of the human spirit. When you watch it you just know that every scene is classic  so many moments will be remembered forever in film history. If anything it just keep getting better with each time I see it. I will continue to enjoy this film for the rest of my life.positive,Nolan made a wise decision in separating The Dark Knight from Batman Begins in that he never tries to mimic it. While the dark and gritty feel of Begins is certainly prevalent in the sequel Knight is its own film with its own story. It rarely if ever feels like Batman Begins 2. It goes without saying that the performances are stellar but I cant not praise the actors. Christian Bale is as he needs to be as is Morgan Freeman Michael Caine and Gary Oldman. Even though Maggie Gyllenhaal was cast due to Katie Holmess inability to return I think she was a necessary change in order to show Rachels growth. Aaron Eckhart is always a joy to watch and he certainly doesnt disappoint here. Heath Ledger deserves an Oscarpositive,Nolan is one of the best Director Ever Wonderful Gotham Risk and superb Joker EXCELLENT One of the best Batman Movies Ever and i just applause after the movie was end Great Movie Great Sequel Great Trilogy and so this is recommended for Superhero Maniac Good job Nolan. And Also The Dark Knight Rises maybe a loser after watching this movie. Great Ending and just great plan vs. great power. Maybe some good movies arent better like this. Joker inspired we that a good person will be fallen and will be same-asshole-like a criminal A great movie for a great person that love Batman and Bales acting was amazing Alfred was greatpositive,Nolan has made another exceptional movie.He has given a new identity to Joker. Not like the other batman seriesthis one is a sure winner. Excellent casting and the dialogues are witty. Heath Ledger steals the show.Gotham city was portrayed in a nice manner. Hans Zimmer has done an excellent job in scoring the background theme. Coming to the field of screenplayit keeps the audience engaged throughout the movie and jokers next move keeps everyone guessing. The movie gives us a hint that there will be a sequel to this one. On the whole it is a well knit movie with excellent acting skills. We can expect more from Christopher Nolan in the future.  about continuity in a lifetime based on friendship and hope that can reduce the most hardened into misty-eyed wonderment. The Shawshank Redemption warrants repeated viewing positive,Nolan has done it again with arguably his best work ever I must say first I am not a comic book reader nor have I ever been. Although I like some heroes more than others I am not a very big Batman fan either. I just never thought he was that special or a good superhero more like a rich man with armor and guns. While I was never a big fan of Batman I am a HUGE fan of The Dark Knight This movie was perfect nothing short of perfect. First off I tip my hat to the late Heath Ledger for his flawless performance of the Joker. Second Christopher Nolan has shined once again. I saw this in theaters and when I left I was amazed. Not only was the overall movie very well paced and interesting the ending was perfect: Batman took the wrap for Two-Faces crimes so Gotham could keep their hero while Batman became the enemy. Truly incredible. Even the music was great..Hans Zimmer never fails his music was great in Inception too also a Nolan movie. I didnt think the sequel to Batman Begins would be as good I was wrong it was 5x better If you want a movie that is serious but also exciting and amazing The Dark Knight should be at the top of your list. 10/10 truly a great all time movie.positive,No words could give enough justice to this film. It is truly a masterpiece. Me and my friend decided to go to see this film in the cinema as we wanted to see Heath Ledger in this final film. I am so glad I went to see this movie. Ill admit that I wasnt sure whether to go and this film at first as Im not really a big fan of Batman and have never seen any of the other movies to do with Batman. I am glad I took the chance to go and see The Dark Knight because it was such a treat. The Joker was my favourite character and not because Heath Ledger portrayed him. I found myself feeling sorry for the Joker and then not liking him and there has only been one other movie that has made me feel that way The Godfather. Christian Bale was great as Batman and in my opinion they could not have cast anyone better for the part. Heath Ledger really did go out with a bang as he astounded me with his acting. The Dark Knight was truly his best role that he has played well at least thats what I think. My list of favourite movies always changes but I know that this one will stay at the top for years to come. Hope my review helped.positive,nick dunne ben affleck lives in the small riverside missouri town that he grew up in it hasnt always been so for a number of years nicky worked in manhattan as a journalist where he met his brilliant wife amy rosamunde pike also a writer amy grew up in the area with two somewhat famous authorparents who concocted a young ladys series of books called amazing amy but the economy took a nosedive and both young marrieds lost their jobs at the same time nicks mother got breast cancer so the couple decided to move back to the show me state nick opens a bar with some of amys trust fund while amy ponders her next move one morning alas nick is called home by a neighbor who has seen his cat outside when he arrives home nick sees signs of a possible breakin at their abode and amy is missing thats right shes gone girl meanwhile there are scenes of amy writing a diary telling the details of how they met and how blissful early married life seemed she also notes that the missouri move has troubled her but now shes missing the police have few clues but believe a media event to ask for the citys help in finding her would be the best way to go reluctantly nick calls his inlaws and they rush to town where they make a televised appeal for amys safe return all too soon nick is attacked as not sorry enough and is fingered as the likely individual responsible for his wifes disappearance the only person in nicks corner at the moment is his twin margo who coowns the bar with an increasing media frenzy nick is in the hot seat but theres more there are secrets by the dozens to be uncovered some for nick and some big ones for amy what appears to be a kidnapping may be something else will she be coming home? will nick be sent to the slammer? this brilliant engrossing thriller cannot be talked about in detail otherwise the twists are revealed lets just say what lies beneath may not be pretty the cast is stunning with affleck and pike doing grand work while neil patrick harris tyler perry kim dickens and all of the others are fantastic too the watery setting is likewise intriguing but its the story script and direction that towers above everything else gillian flynn who wrote the novel has fashioned a script that mirrors the book and is quite wonderful as for the direction david fincher with great editing too keeps the relentless pace and mystery in every moment equally good is his camera shots opting to fade in and out with visual power so add it up and the sum is one fantastic flick indeed as mikey said long ago oh yeah shes gone and viewers wouldnt want it any other waypositive,Nice Movie best batman part love the joker sorry that he died waiting for the new movie Nice Movie best batman part love the joker sorry that he died waiting for the new movie Nice Movie best batman part love the joker sorry that he died waiting for the new movie Nice Movie best batman part love the joker sorry that he died waiting for the new movie Nice Movie best batman part love the joker sorry that he died waiting for the new movie Nice Movie best batman part love the joker sorry that he died waiting for the new movie Nice Movie best batman part love the joker sorry that he died waiting for the new movie Nice Movie best batman part love the joker sorry that he died waiting for the new movie Nice Movie best batman part love the joker sorry that he died waiting for the new movie Nice Movie best batman part love the joker sorry that he died waiting for the new movie Nice Movie best batman part love the joker sorry that he died waiting for the new movie Nice Movie best batman part love the joker sorry that he died waiting for the new movie Nice Movie best batman part love the joker sorry that he died waiting for the new movie Nice Movie best batman part love the joker sorry that he died waiting for the new moviepositive,Never in my life have I been so much fascinated and thrilled as I was while watching The Dark Knight. Its a peach of a movie and is fraught with every element a movie needs to create history. Not everyday you come across a movie like this. Spectacular to say the least. The Dark Knight starts its journey from where Batman Begins ended and slowly we get into the gripping duel of the batman and the joker as the beautifully crafted story scarily moves into its epic climax. Not only is the plot an engrossing epic it has a sense of an agonizing tragedy which hits you and gets into you. Kudos to Nolan who is maturing with every film for his impeccable direction and awesome portrayal of Batman. The way he has portrayed the psyche of the joker Harvey Dent and Batman and the way he has convoluted the story-line by pitting against each other the complicated ideologies of good and evil is sensational. Not to forget the electrifying performances of almost everybody who has been in this movie. Bale is flawless as usual and he handles the dual role of Wayne and Batman with perfection. Aaron Eckhart shines as Harvey Dent and Maggie Gyllenhaal does a far better job as Rachel than Katie Holmes did in Batman Begins. Michael Caine is as usual proper as Alfred but the icing on the cake surely is Heath Ledger. Mr Ledger pulls off a stunner and oh man is he not good Quite rightly an Oscar winning performancedeserving all the accolades that has been showered upon him and sadly his last. May he rest in peace. Folks to sum up all I can say is that The Dark Knight is by all means one of the greatest movies that has ever been made if not the greatest. Please dont miss this and be prepared to be mesmerizedpositive,My wife and myself parents of three little kids rarely get to go to the cinema. Two weeks ago during our holidays we got my parent to babysit the little monsters so that we can finally get out again. Taking a peek into the papers actually *real* papers I had no internet access :-  revealed that The Dark Knight was the only watchable movie playing in the small nearby town. Somewhat reluctantly we decided to give it a try. What the hell we thought we are on holidays anyway why not check a kids movie sorry to all fans of previous Batman movies but thats just what I think of them. BOY were we surprised After the movie it took us a few minutes before we both burst out this is one of the best movies I ever saw I wont go into any details for the multitude of excellent comments on this board already presents this movie as it is: a MASTERPIECE Especially the performance of the late Heath Ledger Joker was unbelievable posthumous Oscar anyone I actually felt quite nervous and actually even a bit scared during some Joker scenes - something I didnt experience that often in a movie theater And yet we both felt that quite a few lines of his could have been from us... :- Its a must please go watch it either in a real movie theater or in a DAMN good home theater. While the special effects in this movie are just what they *should* be a mere vehicle to transport the message the atmosphere of the movie just wont come over if you watch it on a 19 monitor with your 5.1 headset on... :- Id gladly pay again to see it one more timepositive,my wife and i went to boyhood on its opening day in christchurch new zealand we had recently seen the trailer and were keen to see the film it did not disappoint us the acting was excellentso good that at times we found we forgot we were watching a movie rather than a documentary it was great to see an understated american movie rather than the overblown dialogue* and direction we so often seehear its a long movie but time just flew we have two adult sons and although life and culture in nz is not the same as shown in boyhood we found many situations in the movie which struck a chord for us i would write more but other reviewers have expressed it much better than i suffice it to say of all the movies i have seen in the last 68 years this one goes straight into my top 10 *what i call the seinfeld syndrome theres a joke coming raise eyebrows look at camera    did you get thatill say it againpositive,My story is one of fate. I went to the video store expecting to get Terminator II on laserdisc. It was out and out of desperation to rent something I asked for what was new. I was given the Shawshank Redemption. I had never heard of it quite honestly but I gave it a try but was not expecting much but two hours of time pass. The first time through watching it I thought it was good. Nothing extraordinary. But something made me watch it again. And I was hooked. I cant explain it but this movie gets better every time you watch it. I ended up watching it about 8 times in that 4 day timespan. Watch this movie as your bucket list of things to do in life. You really have not lived till you have seen it. I admit to being completely obsessed by the movie owning it on every medium imaginable and having all the books and posters about it. But do not let my obsession dissuade you. I do not impress easily but I can tell you this is simply the greatest movie ever made in cinema. Every moment and every dialog of this movie fits in perfectly to create the greatest masterpiece in American cinema.positive,My overall review for the movie  IT WAS AMAZING. Its a masterpiece. I mean I have never watched any superhero movie this good. What an acting performance by heath this is the only villain which is more liked than the actual hero. And a whole lot of good direction by Nolan. Hattsoff to him.The story overall describes the fearthe pain and the agony that Dark Knight suffers. This movie is a must must must watch.n addition to new characters like Harvey Dent played superbly by Aaron Eckhart by the way all significant characters from Nolans previous film Batman Begins return for this new adventure. Police lieutenant Jim Gordon played by Gary Oldman Bruce Waynes faithful butler Alfred played by Michael Caine Waynes go-to guy for fancy gizmos Lucius Fox played by Morgan Freeman and assistant DA and Waynes love interest Rachel Dawes played this time by Maggie Gylenhaal are all back and have respectable roles to play here but The Dark Knight is ultimately about Batman and The Joker. Its a much darker film than any of the previous Batman movies and it goes into directions that few comic-book films have taken before. Much of that edginess comes from The Joker and his sinister plans. Not merely content at killing his enemies The Joker chooses to psychologically torment his rivals by forcing them to question what they stand for.positive,My life is forever changed due to this movie. It is a movie of hope redemption and friendship. It shows a deep growing friendship between two prisoners Andy and Red. They each are shown growing through their distinct hardships at Shawshank prison. As time passes hope wanes but a flame burns bright in Andy. His hope and unrelentless nature carry over to his friend Red. As Reds long stay in prison comes to an end he sees the light at the end of the tunnel. Andy has left it for him to see the way to freedom and he follows it. This film parallels my life and leaves me wondering if my advice will help somebody see the light. For some of those people time will tell. As for now Ill be patient to wait and see. Dont end up like Brooks there will always be someone to help you out. There is someone out there that cares for you. Thank you Andy Dufresne your hope is the flame of my life.positive,my favorite of the series ghost protocol 2nd this film s high marks all the way around the story acting and directing all are first class i read that many people who have seen the movie for the first time were confused by the plot so was i but after screening it a second time i was pleasantly surprised at the many subtle nuances to the story there really were its a story that doesnt treat you like a child so many movies directors think they have to go out of there way to spell everything out for the audience scenes that have no other purpose than to drive home an obvious point not this one if i had my way brian de palma would have been involved in the other three de palma was the only one who captured the feel and the look of what i thought the movie should have been if youve only seen it once see it again and enjoy it for the classic that it ispositive,My favorite movie of all times. Excellentbrilliantexquisite.... Soooooo emotional and so epic at the same timethe best example is the scene when King Theoden encourages his soldiersand tells themthat they have to fight because there are greater things at stakes than their lives. I cry every time. The battle for Minas Tirith is very dramaticmakes you sit at the edge of your seat all the time. The ending contains very Tolkien-like feelinghappiness mixed with a bit of grief and loss. If there is anyone on this planet who havent seen it yetknowyou are very wrongthis movie is worth your timeand it will give you so much pleasure.positive,My favorite movie ever. These are words that basically describe how I feel about this movie. A prison drama does not sound like an entertaining movie but this is very entertaining. Tim Robbins The Player I.Q. stars as Andy Dufresne a smart man convicted of killing his wife and her lover. He arrives at Shawshank prison completely out of place but adapts and becomes best friends with one of the prisons head convicts wonderfully played by Morgan Freeman Driving Miss Daisy Seven. Soon the warden played by Bob Gunton Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil Broken Arrow enlists his help as a banker to help with getting some extra illegal money and other things. It doesnt sound like a great movie but trust me this is the best movie Ive ever seen and everyone I know liked it. Tim Robbins is great in the lead. Bob Gunton is good as the twisted warden. William Sadler Solo Die Hard 2 is solid as a fellow convict. Clancy Brown Starship Troopers Highlander is excellent as the sadistic head of the guards. Finally James Whitmore The Relic and Gil Bellows Snow White: A tale of terror give the best supporting performances as fellow convicts. A must see.positive,my favorite movie by far. The path of the righteous man is beset on all sides by the inequities of the selfish and the tyranny of evil men. Blessed is he who in the name of charity and good will shepherds the weak through the valley of darkness for he is truly his brothers keeper and the finder of lost children. And I will strike down upon thee with great vengeance and furious anger those who would attempt to poison and destroy my brothers. And you will know my name is the Lord when I lay my vengeance upon thee. The path of the righteous man is beset on all sides by the inequities of the selfish and the tyranny of evil men.

One of the vital elements in the Fellowships strategy is to draw Saurons eye away from Frodo and here Aragons role is crucial. The last debate in the movie is totally inadequate in explaining the suicidal march to the Black gate but the DVD makes it very clear with the additional scene of Aragon revealing himself to Sauron though the Palantir. He is the bait that Sauron cannot resist. Another important aspect is that Aragon comes into the city of Minas Tirith first and foremost as a HEALER not as a king. The kingship comes afterwards. This is again brought out in the additional scenes in the DVD although still missing a lot of details from the book. Still disappointing even for the DVD is that so little is given to the story of Eowyn and Faramir. The dialogue through which they come to accept each other could very well be the most beautiful in the entire book. The few shots in the DVD that trace the development of their relationship are far from adequate although thats a least a slight improvement from the film version. Another disappointment is Aragons arrival at the Pelennor Fields which is hopelessly lame compared with the original treatment in the book: amidst the despair of the Rohan and Gondor soldiers in witnessing the approaching black ships Aragons standard suddenly unfurls at the main mast: There flowered a White Tree and that was for Gondorpositive,Much too often these days superlatives are thrown around to describe the greatness of movies and music. In this case any superlative used is an understatement. This is unlike anything that has ever been made and probably ever will be made. Few films I have seen can stir as many emotions as effectively as ROTK. After more than three hours the film still leaves the audience wanting more. If there is any justice ROTK would sweep every awards ceremony in existence. Combined with Fellowship and Two Towers the unprecedented trilogy helmed by Peter Jackson towers over any achievement in the medium in scope character and impact. The bar has been raised and the standard has been surpassed. Motion pictures will never be the same.  and as well dont spend ever hour of the day sitting at home sharpening their knives. Although The Sopranos later perfected and brought reasoning to this fact making their characters part of society and disguising themselves as members Pulp Fiction places them within the daily activities of an odd group distinguishes them from ordinary civilians and keeps them afloat through simplistic dialogue demonstrating the needs and wants of a first world audience  such as relationships religion or something as simple as what to eat for breakfast  and I dont know about you but I was thoroughly disappointed when Fabienne had to get Buttermilk pancakes instead of Blueberry. It feels like a clich’© to say it but for a long time Pulp Fiction was my favorite film. It was as influential to me in 2010 as it was to the people who first saw it in the mid-90s. I could go on for hours discussing the unconventional style of chronology the homages to such films as The Bodyguard : Jules famous Ezekiel 25:17 biblical quote is shown within the films opening crawl On The Waterfront : Bruce Willis character Butchs resemblance to Marlon Brandos character through a self-dilemma or The Aristocats : From the famous Twist-Dance contest where Uma Thurman bases her moves from that of the Duchess character in the 1970 Disney animation. Yet what makes the film so unique is not the homages to films or magazines mainstream audiences wouldnt recognize nor the bleak humor but through these characters and their reflections through an array of bizarre and oddly connected events. I continue to adore this film for several rationales but to me the people were always the most specific. They were original just like the film and shaped the American audience into viewers ready to find enjoyment from extraordinary people discussing foot massages and European hamburgers for several minutes of screen time. Quentin Tarantino... you are a geniuspositive,Much has been written and praised deservedly so about The Shawshank Redemption. The fact that its #1 on this list gives me faith in humanity. Instead of talking about its obvious care with excellent writing directing editing and cinematography Ill just say how much the film has meant to me personally. Its message of hope and above all perseverance kept me going through many of lifes travails. I think I responded to how it dealt with the day-to-day grind of life albeit in dramatic fashionand even the stress of boredom. The other thing it demonstrated was how profoundly one person can affect another without even saying much to them. After all Andy and Red only have one true baring-their-souls conversation in 19 years together One of the greatest scenes in the history of movies by the way. Yet we are fully aware of how much these two meant to each other and how moved we are when they are reunited. Its a real spiritual journey visually as well  it is before these walls that the doom of our time will be decided. The city is a spectacular achievement by the special- effects artisans who show it as part fortress part Emerald City topping a mountain with a buttress reaching out over the plain below where the battle will be joined. In a scene where Gandalf rides his horse across the drawbridge and up the ramped streets of the city its remarkable how seamlessly Jackson is able to integrate computer- generated shots with actual full-scale shots so they all seem of a piece. Jacksons achievement cannot be denied. The Return of the King is such a crowning achievement such a visionary use of all the tools of special effects such a pure spectacle that it can be enjoyed  Tolkiens story is so sweeping and Jackson includes so much of it that only devoted students of the Ring can be sure they understand every character relationship and plot point.positive,Movies simply do not get better than this. Inspiring captivating intense funny at times tragic at times. Interesting and thrilling. Every aspect of this movie is perfection: the acting story dialog production setting cinematography etc... all perfect. This film is truly flawless. I could not describe this movie as fun but I would describe it is unparalleled in its excellence- and not in some stupid artsy sense- just plain and simple it is story telling at its finest. If you havent seen this movie you absolutely need to watch it right now. Fantastic. I wish I could give it a higher rating than 10 out of 10 stars.positive,mission impossible tells the story of wrongly disavowed secret agent ethan hunt trying to prevent the theft of a list of all the secret agents in the world with the help of two other disavowed agents played by ving rhames and jean reno while all this is going on he must find the true mole in his agency that set him up mission impossible is the perfect film for anyone who enjoys a good spy movie the plot is quick and to the point it never lets up for a minute unfortunately when it comes to spy movies im left stumped with some of the details with mission impossible even though they talk about things that are hard for the layman to understand it can be easily figured out before the end of the film but who cares anyway? the action scenes are amazing particularly the famous sequence of ethan hunt dangling from a ceiling and catching a sweat droplet so it doesnt trigger the alarm since im young i never had the pleasure of watching the tv show but if it was anything like this movie im sure id truly enjoy it all the roles in the film are played very well i particularly enjoyed the fact that ethan hunts team is made up of well established actors such as jon voight emilio estevez and kristen scott thomas youre saying great cast this should be good then without a moments notice theyre all dead in the first 10 minutes mission impossible is an amazing thrill ride movie just what youd expect from the director of scarface and the untouchables 810positive,mission impossible is an action thriller that features tom cruise as ethan huntit directed by brian de palmabased on from the television series of the same name the story follows a new agentethan huntplayed by tom cruisehis new mission is to uncover the mole within the cia who has framed him for the murders of his entire imf team this film are shot in great locationsthe cinematography was pleasantthe acting was goodspecial mentions should be given to cruisejon voight as jim phelps and emmanuelle bart as jim phelpss daughterclaire the stunts are thrilling but not exceptionalwhile the story is good although it does not really require deep thinking as everything is explained in the endde palmas direction is also worthy of praiseoverallit is a great entertaining action thrillerpositive,mission impossible is an action thriller that features tom cruise as ethan huntit directed by brian de palmabased on from the television series of the same name the story follows a new agentethan huntplayed by tom cruisehis new mission is to uncover the mole within the cia who has framed him for the murders of his entire imf team this film are shot in great locationsthe cinematography was pleasantthe acting was goodspecial mentions should be given to cruisejon voight as jim phelps and emmanuelle b_art as jim phelpss daughterclaire the stunts are thrilling but not exceptionalwhile the story is good although it does not really require deep thinking as everything is explained in the endde palmas direction is also worthy of praiseoverallit is a great entertaining action thrillerpositive,mission impossible is a movie about a spy who must uncover a mole in his organization i really liked this movie it is extremely well written and albeit a little confusing but if you listen closely you should be able to follow it it has an incredible amount of suspense and intrigue and i would recommend it to anyone who is tired of the same formulaic bondtype movies the ending is probably my favorite in any movie and is well worth sitting through some of the dialoguebased scenes in the end there is nothing not to like about this movie if you find it confusing you are probably used to badly written movies this movie was not written for audiences and is not meant to be easy to understand it is more believable that way i think 910positive,mission impossible a 1996 film directed by brian de palma is a great film i do know others have found it jarring with a confusing storyline and i have to somewhat agree however there are many other elements which make this a very enjoyable film  first and foremost i love the cinematography  the tilted angles which shows how chaotic the situation that ethan hunt played by tom cruise is put in jim phelps played by jon voight expertly plays his mentor in an interesting role ving rhames stars as luther stickell the only other character besides ethan hunt who is in all 3 films so far emmanuelle beart as claire phelps also makes an appealing love interest the action sequences are topnotch especially the helicopter sequence at the end and the music is very fitting by master composer danny elfman i would recommend this film  a high 8 out of 10positive,Misery and Stand By Me were the best adaptations up until this one now you can add Shawshank to that list. This is simply one of the best films ever made and I know I am not the first to say that and I certainly wont be the last. The standing on the IMDb is a true barometer of that. #3 as of this date and Im sure it could be number 1. So Ill just skip all the normal praise of the film because we all know how great it is. But let me perhaps add that what I find so fascinating about Shawshank is that Stephen King wrote it. King is one of the best writers in the world. Books like IT and the Castle Rock series are some of the greatest stories ever told. But his best adaptations are always done by the best directors. The Shining was brilliantly interpreted by Kubrick and of course the aforementioned Misery and Stand By Me are both by Rob Reiner. Now Frank Darabont comes onto the scene and makes arguably the best King film ever. He seems to understand what King wants to say and he conveys that beautifully. What makes this film one of the best ever made is the message it conveys. It is one of eternal hope. Andy Dufresne played by Tim Robbins has been sent to prison for a crime he did not commit. But he never loses hope. He never gives up his quest to become a free man again. His years of tenacity patience and wits keep him not only sane but it gives his mind and a spirit a will to live. This film has a different feel to it. There has never been anything like it before and I dont know if there will again. Im not going to say any more about this film it has already been said but just suffice to say that I am glad that Forrest Gump won best picture in 94. I would have been equally glad if Pulp Fiction or Shawshank would have won. It is that good of a movie and one that will be appreciated for years to come.positive,minor spoilers but only if you havent read the book. some of the more awe inspiring moments for me were The Rohirim riding into battle at Gondor Faramir leading his troops into Osgillioth against impossible odds the moment Pippin becomes a man so to speak and the whole of Minas Tirith bowing down to four halflings who might earlier have been dismissed as insignificant... its moments like these that allow you to forgive the hollywood showboating of Orlando Bloom on the battlefield and other such excesses.  watch it and just go along with it. If you feel inclined to look up how it played out on the internet go ahead or if you want to give it a rewatch that is fine too. Viewing multiple clips for a second time I think I finally understand it more but a lot of questions youll still be asking after repeated viewings. One of the most famous questions is whats in the briefcase that is recovered by Vega and Winnfield in the early scenes of the film. Im sure when writing the film Tarantino himself didnt know what he wanted to put in the briefcase. Im also sure he didnt think it would blow up into such a debacle on the message boards and through word of mouth. What truly makes Pulp Fiction worthwhile is the genius dialog. Tarantino cranks out the best script possible combined with enough wit and violence to please the most demanding and picky action-film fan. One moment the two are discussing why a Quarter Pounder With Cheese from McDonalds is called a Royale With Cheese in France. Next they are threatening violence if a victim asks the question what again. Why do I not condone constant swearing and gratuitous violence in other films but for some reason award a perfect  to a film that is made up of it Because Pulp Fiction shows how it should be done. It depicts realistic situations handled intelligently and with wit and soul. It doesnt utilize them for the purpose of being monotonous or dreary but to advance an already crafty storyline. The character are under such stress it only makes sense that they are constantly shouting four letter words. Is it necessary Not really. But Pulp Fiction isnt just about swearing. It proves that true cinema still exists and that even a story that appears choppy and inconsistent on paper can still produce one of the best films of the decade. Starring: John Travolta Samuel L. Jackson Uma Thurman Harvey Keitel Tim Roth Amanda Plummer Maria de Medeiros Ving Rhames Eric Stoltz Rosanna Arquette Christopher Walken Bruce Willis and Quentin Tarantino. Directed by: Quentin Tarantino. positive,Mild spoilers ahead. Like many people I had very high expectations when I walked into the theater today but unlike some people whos reviews Ive read here I wasnt disappointed. I loved this film. Sure there are things that are bothering like they way certain characters are changed as in the case of Faramir and Denethor - and Theoden as well in my opinion or completely left out as in the case of Saruman and Gr’_ma. But there is so much beauty in this film which makes up for it. The musical  is amazing. Someone here loathed Howard Shore for writing pompous and sentimental music - I dont understand it. This is the most wonderful soundtrack I have ever heard except for maybe the one in Fellowship Of The Ring. If this is not rewarded with an Oscar in February something is very very wrong. During the first two movies I was always bothered by the fact that Merry and Pippin were turned into comic figures simply there to lighten up serious moments. In this movie Billy Boyd and Dominic Monaghan finally get to work a little more on their characters - characters which I love. And they do it so well. I have to admit that my absolute favourite moment in the movie was Pippin singing before Denethor while the battle goes on outside. It was a beautiful and very strong scene. Does anyone think that the Academy will remember Billy Boyd when its time for the Oscars But there were things that were left out that should not have been mainly in the ending. There were no explanations to how Faramir Eowyn or Merry were suddenly healed there was nothing with Pippin being in Minas Tirith before the battle and as I said Saruman and Gr’_ma were left out. Not good. One can only hope there will be more of this in the extended version of the dvd. Im very much looking forward to it  Legolas the elf  Gimli the dwarf  Aragorn and Boromir both men  and three other hobbits Sam Merry and Pippin. This unlikely alliance comes together in a spirit of acceptance and tolerance to fight the satanic Sauron and his devilish henchmen. Those of us who do not consider ourselves fans of fantasy initially may have thought to dismiss the movies as far-fetched overblown silliness. It was hard to imagine the films as relevant or transcending their genre. But many of us have come around to another point of view: The films tell a classic story that espouses the virtues of love hard work and compassion and decries greed deceit and abuse of power in a mighty struggle against temptation and the corrupting forces of power. The storys message about conserving natural resources has profound significance for our times as does the notion of taking up arms against an evil tyrant and the importance of overcoming prejudice to work toward a common goal of peace. Ironically these simple messages were massively complicated to pull off requiring a budget of nearly $300 million a crew of 26000 extras and a production team of 2400 which included medieval weapons designers stone sculptors linguists blacksmiths and model builders. Bringing to life such a wide-ranging story with technical proficiency and visual dazzle is an unprecedented achievement one that likely will define Jackson much as George Lucas is forever linked to the Star Wars movies he directed. Though the acting ensemble is strong the movie does not belong to any one of them. While Elijah Wood capably carries off Frodos transition from boy to man his is not the most indelible performance. Gollum voiced by and physically patterned after the movements of British actor Andy Serkis is the most realistic other-worldly character since E.T. and similarly will remain etched in moviegoers collective memories. Ian McKellens Gandalf has a larger role in the third film morphing from wizard/prophet to army general and one cannot imagine the role played by anyone else. Viggo Mortensens principled Aragorn is the king to whom the third films title refers. A key character is the landscape of Middle-earth. The movies feel mythical but look historical. In the third installment for example Minas Tirith a seven-tiered city of kings looks European Byzantine and fantastical at the same time. There is a bittersweet quality in the trilogys coming to an end Š—” even if The Return of the King seems ready to conclude at least three times before the movie finally comes to a rather anticlimactic close. Many moviegoers like Jackson and the cast Š—” who grew quite close during filming Š—” may understand and even appreciate the lingering goodbye. And while s of film goers clamor to see the final installment no one is eager for the journey to end. Jacksons masterpiece will no doubt have a long life on DVD and be the subject of countless revivals over the years. The directors next project is a remake of King Kong which seems a bit like hiring Michelangelo to paint an office building. Though if anyone can make something out of that tired vehicle Jackson can. Should Jackson sign on to make The Hobbit the Rings finale might feel more like a temporary till we meet again than a formal goodbye. positive,Maybe Im writing a review too late for this movie but I think I must write something for this. Shawshank Redemption is a truly A Class movie that teaches us many things like friendship and never gave up your hope. Unlike other users I think this movie deserves to be in IMDb Top 250 list. Today IMDbs Top 250 List approved and considered by everyone. So everybody must see that this movie is in top and must watch it to see why IMDb puts this movie on top and not Godfather. I really like the role of Red by Morgan Freeman. He really acts like a experienced jail-mate. Andy Dufresne is okay too. What I really like is that I really love the end. Maybe this is the best ending ever. I really like how Red laughs to Andy about pickaxe and Andy dig 19 years  WOW  to made a hole in the wall how he escape and become a person he made it up for Wardens dirty job how his dreams come true and lastly after 5 years in jail after Andy escaped how Red not decided to suicide decided to follow Andy. Best Movie Ever... 10/10positive,Maybe for me and I think most of true Batman fans at first glance this isnt comic book Batman that I was expecting. Its marvelous how Nolan succeeded to present in one movie Batman that is so realistic and that we can connect to it and really be pulled into movie and that he preserves all craziness of Joker that is demanded from his character. Batman movie can be done in various ways and one reason is because Batman and his greatest enemy have no superpowers and I see that as a good thing because then you have more space and need to present these characters not as someone who can really exist but as someone who put you more into movie and unreal world of comic book at the same time. He put this two things together in something that almost everyone would watch and like but without losing true representation of Dark knight.positive,Mark my words the Nolans brothers will be on the same level as the Coens shortly. Their films provide a dark and disturbing world into Batmans persona and the illusion of the life he desires Bruce Wayne. Simply put this film possesses every attribute a viewer looks for in a film. It has tremendous writing directing acting scenery and plot. How can you go wrong with Oldman Eckhart Caine Gyllenhaal Ledger Freeman and Bale. A superstar cast that doesnt disappoint. I wont spoil the film for anyone but I urge all to see it. It is my own selfish need but I feel robbed that cinema will never again see such a disturbing and entertaining character personified in Ledgers performance. RIP...positive,many went into this film with high expectations and hype that was unprecedented much like the somewhat disappointing godzilla 2014 from earlier this year not many knew what to expect with this film considering that the guardians of the galaxy were for the most part unheard of characters to the general public this film did not disappoint in any way it is by far the greatest marvel film ever made downing the avengers and days of future past i went into this movie with a feeling that i dont usually get with a film i knew that this was going to be different and good at the same given time and i was not let down from the very opening scene to the ending credits there was not even a second of boredom to say that this film was entertaining would be putting it under the bus this film was exhilarating never have i seen a film that grasped my attention and kept me in awe from start to finish as for the technical aspects this film has the best cgi i have ever seen not once did the animation look even relatively fake or cheesy the cgi will probably revolutionize the field much like 2009s avatar i felt as though i could reach out and touch these alien creatures and the amazingly designed ships the  of the film was beautiful as was the cinematography there were emotional scenes that were played so well with the  that it was as if they were interchangeable parts that had to be together to work in unison every shot of this film was gorgeous and breathtaking i saw so many things that i have never seen in a film before and for them to capture it so crisply is truly astounding the acting was very well done by all of the cast members there may not be any oscar buzz for the cast but that doesnt mean that they werent perfect for their roles chris pratt was genius as star lord bautista was hilarious as drax the destroyer and bradley cooper and vin diesel did great jobs for voice acting both being highlights for the film as far as writing this movie did something truly unique it focused on all of the guardians with equal screen time and equal information of their lives though star lord may have a bit more for obvious reasons all of the personalities of the main characters were written so well that i forgot for a period of time that it was even a movie the humor is not dirty for the most part and is not slap stick and tiresome every scene with humor did its job to make the whole crowd in the theater laugh hysterically the dialogue was simply that well written every aspect of this film was great obviously it isnt a perfect film but it manages to do something that directors have forgotten about it entertains the audience and that is the sole purpose of the entire film films now rely so heavily on art and the directors ideas of uniqueness that most films are only appreciated by certain groups guardians of the galaxy is a film that anyone can watch and they will enjoy themselves from start to finish and never want to leave the theater while watching this movie at the opening friday i couldnt help but think to myself over and over again that this is the next star wars it has the same chemistry and formula but in my own opinion it exceeds the original star wars it is an updated and modern form of that film technique of pure entertainment mixed with humor and character development that adults can relate to as well it is rare that i say this but this film will make you cry make you laugh make you excited make you fearful etc it is every genre and yet no genre guardians is going to be a staple in film and will one day be considered one of the greatest sci fi films ever james gunn was the director of one of the worst films of 2013 in movie 43 but he has proved that he is one of the elite despite a horrible effort a year prior this film resurrects the original intention and purpose of film to entertain i believe it will be the next star wars and spawn many more films to comepositive,Many Tarantino fans differ on what Tarantinos best film was. Reservoir Dogs Pulp Fiction Inglorious Basterds Having seen all three the opinion I submit is the majority opinionŠ—”Pulp Fiction. But why Pulp Fiction in my view represents something few movies can pull off. A completely pointless narrative made into an astonishingly good film. What is so good about a movie with no point Its actually rather simple. Pulp Fiction doesnt use extensive special effects or mind-bending plot or bizarre character development. Tarantino in fact wrote this one pretty much by-the-book along with co-writer Roger Avary. The plot is nothing unusual or never-before-seen. But its the careful eye of the artist in front of and behind the camera that makes this film such a treat. I have watched it six times already and each time the movie just gets better. Each time I see something in the background that I didnt see before. I catch something someone says or see some minor backdrop detail that I didnt pick up on. However this isnt why I love Pulp Fiction so much. These details are not the main thing. Its the complete package. When you step back and look at Pulp Fiction as a whole it is nothing short of a masterpiece. Tarantino specifically chose 50 ASA film stock to make it look older than it was. This film created a beautiful look for a movie set in the sunny Hollywood Heights. The music was perfect for the crime thriller part of the feel of this movie and the use of the Hawthorne Grill and the Chevy Nova were perfect selections to add to the classic feel of this movie even though its quite apparent that its set in the modern day. Butch is driven to the hotel in a Checker cab everything in general feels older than it really is. But what really sells it is the actors. Today this wouldnt be a star-studded cast it would be a diamond-studded cast-on-platinum cast. John Travolta and Samuel L. Jackson make perfect hit men and are crucial at the beginning of the film to setting up a surprising scene. Uma Thurmans small role is nevertheless appreciated and she makes the most of her screen time not only on the part of the writers but also because she has excellent delivery on her lines. At the end though I feel that Jackson is the star even though there is truly no primary role here. His monologues are to die for in this movie. All in all if you have not seen Pulp Fiction change that.positive,Many people I know havent yet seen this film put off by the comic book aspect. Batman Im not really into that Its for kids isnt it WRONG Forget the genre this is a timeless masterpiece. Unlike a lot of recent Superhero movies including Batman Begins this doesnt waste time with how they gained their powers what their backstory is a love interest distraction etc. It starts with Batman and ends with Batman. The film grips you from the very beginning and takes you on a mesmerising roller-coaster of tense action and drama. Whilst there is a grand finale of sorts the brilliant spirit of human race boat scene you could pick 4 or 5 different scenes from the film which all could have merited any films climax. Take for example the attempted shooting of the major scene Batmans dilemma of who to save between Harvey Dent and Rachel the hospital exploding etc. Quite frankly the film leaves you physically exhausted. Heath Ledgers Joker is also one of the most brutally savage badies in movie history. Savage in the sense that he has no super power no physical strength of skill but has the mind of a genius. When he talks you start thinking Hold up why do I want this guy to succeed Its a Thriller with no Filla I can never pull that phrase offpositive,Many Batman films have seen their day. You had Adam Wests comical Batman portrayal to Michael Keatons classic performance. Then comes the embarrassing stages of the Batman franchise. Batman Forever which was decent. Then the terrible Batman & Robin which was terrible. Then you have the Great Batman Begins. Then there is this masterpiece. The characters are spot on. Heath Ledger is a great Joker. Aaron Eckharts performance as Harvey Dent blows Tommy Lee Jones role as the same character in Batman Forever away. Maggie Gyllenhaal Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman are always great. And Christian Bale proves to be the best Batman yet. Graphics are great acting is great great plot and a great movie.positive,Man All the movies this guy had made is just great He is simply a mastermind This movie had great actors great story and well u can say that EVERYTHING is just perfect Ultra Highly Recommended Movie A MUST seepositive,maleficent starring angelina jolie takes a new view on the sleeping beauty story from the life of maleficent the fairy this is much like the musical wicked which tells the story of the wizard of oz from the life of the wicked witch everything about this movie just screamed awesome the special effects the cinematography and the acting were all spot on the magical forest home to maleficent and all of the magical creatures almost the entire forest was computer generated but it looked as real as ever the detail that was put into the creatures of the forest was incredible they didnt cut any corners when making this movie even with the smallest of fairies you could still see every wrinkle every smile and every movement clear as day and watching as maleficent soars across the water and watching it ripple or as she flies through the sky breaking through clouds was nothing less than breath taking everything in this film looked as real as anything ive ever seen the camera angles and lighting were also just as superb everything just seemed natural it didnt like i was even watching a movie more that i was actually experiencing everything that was happening the lighting for the movie was great when it was bright it wasnt too bright and when it was dark it wasnt pitch black but the low light scenes are what really got me in the castle where most of the low lighting scenes took place the amber lights from the torches never clashed with the casting lights and blended right in and when maleficents forest was dark they added soothing yet eerie purple orbs of light all over the place to give the scene an ominous but peaceful feel the acting was as spot on as the rest of the movie angelina jolie was truly born to play the role of maleficent she was sweet and kind but strong and vengeful while still keeping her wisdom and she wasnt the only amazing actor copley played a proud but paranoid king who will stop at nothing to destroy maleficent fanning played an innocent and beautiful if you can get past her blonde hair and brown eyebrows but strong aurora and riley played a obedient yet free spirited diaval the crow even the small actors in this movie did an amazing job this movie is one of the best nonanimated disney movies that i believe has ever been made the acting special effects and the cinematography were just plain incredible you could really tell that the actors and the director put a lot of time into this movie and it couldnt have been any better 1010 for surepositive,maleficent is magnificent the story is sophisticated enough to delight adult audiences with a brilliant take on the beloved tale with a delightful twist including the meaning of true love the characters are sympathetic and there is enough excitement the art direction and cinematography are beautiful the fairy land scenes resemble a pre raphaelite painting the castle was a bit generic cgi the right blend of human faces with cgi so it didnt look too animated the director stromberg who did oz the great and powerful did an even better job here angelina jolies expressive face is the perfect showcase for the character  it is the role of her lifetime like the way they did her cheekbones to make it like the disney cartoon sam riley as her sidekick morphs into many fairy tale creatures crow dragon horse the creatures are well done not awkward in movement and not overwhelming elle fanning is sweet and picture perfect for the role of aurora and brenton thwaites plays her prince the fairies including juno temple and imelda staunton are cute too liked this more than the snow white movies mirror mirror and snow white and the hunstman the first was fun but a bit silly and the second was too grim maleficent is the perfect blend of excitement and fairy tale most enjoyable film of the yearpositive,maleficent disneys maleficent is a retelling of their 1959s sleeping beauty that was derived from charles perraults the sleeping beauty it is a beautiful movie the story is so well written the scenes are well directed and acted i will say that the 3d is not worth it if you are going to go go to the 2d because the picture is better i give maleficent 9 out of 10 stars it is a great family movie that everyone will enjoy as long as you enjoy fairy tales with a great twist from what we are used to hearing ****************spoiler alert below********************* maleficent retells the original disneys sleepy beauty it does a fantastic job at it it aids in the frozen redefining of the phrases true love and true loves kiss which i am a huge fan of linda woolverton is the writer of this version of sleeping beauty she is truly a master at finding the voice of maleficent it is based more on the life of maleficent it is written so the it rounds out and mirrors the characters of maleficent and aurora while at the same time bringing depth to all of the characters in the movie except prince phillip which is intentional when you see the movie youll see why i say this the actors do a superb job angelina jolie as top bill was phenomenal she does for maleficent what margaret hamilton did for the wicked witch of the west she brings the character to life there are moments that steal your heart between aurora and maleficent you see maleficent harden and then you see her soften aurora is played superbly by elle fanning and a few other young girls one of the moments that will really grab your heart is between angelina jolie and her own daughter playing aurora at a very young age it is a moment of truthfulness between the characters imelda staunton leads the three fairies that are to take care of aurora there are really great moments there sharlto copley plays the infamous stefan just as he was a fantastic psycho baddie in elysium he is so in maleficent he masterfully shows a plunge into a psychotic king that is paranoid of losing his own life sometimes seemingly over that of his daughter as far as directing and the cinematography go this is top notch this is robert strombergs directing debut and he really shows off his chops as well as the cinematography work of dean semler i hope to see these two team up again the picturing and mise en scene is perfect there are moments of close ups and the scene filled with other characters that just take you by surprise and make your heart melt the hits that i really have for you are the moments where actors jolie and copley slip in and out of their accents copley has moments where he attempts an irish accent and it is a wee bit disastrous see what i did there the greatest moments are when he accepts his southern african accent and just goes for it in the last moments of the film they have prince phillip and he really isnt needed in that scene hes used as a plot device earlier in the movie and the pay off is great but his reentrance into the forest isnt needed the 3d and 2d are not needed 2d in this movie is what you want to see it is brighter and has a greater sense of detail to the beautiful pictures there are moments in the 3d version where everything is just way too dark whereas in the 2d it is not there are also moments such as the dragon scene and the moores scene that couldve been outrageously beautiful but they fall completely flat on their face if i were a producer i wouldve called out the 3d editing and the last and slight hit i wouldve liked to see a green tinge to maleficentpositive,Magnificent. This is one word and it does the film the justice it deserves. Its a triumph on so many fronts technical and creative or both at the same time. Great story innovative and clever direction super editing high quality acting stirring soundtrack composition nigh on flawless special effects well drilled stunt performers wonderfully authentic prop design. Hell I could go on all day there are so many elements here that are excellent I find it hard to spot and point out the flaws. Maybe as well the fact that the film has left me speechless on three occasions. Fundamentally though one could strip away the fantasy elements the huge battles and dazzling effects and youd still be left with a fine film. Why Well because the themes it deals with are so affecting and beautifully written and acted that there would still be a gripping humane drama to play out. The corrupting lure of power against the strength of friendship. As the ring takes hold of Frodo he could be lost to the evil that has taken the pitiable Smeagol but through courage and willpower from both himself and Sam his character triumphs. It is to the credit of Elijah Wood and Sean Astin that they convey this spirit so well on screen. It is also to the credit of Andy Serkis and the nice chaps at Weta digital that Smeagol/Gollum is so compelling. He must be one of the most complexly deceptive characters to have ever been written about. Sweet and innocent but brutally cold and calculating. A true enigma of a person. This couldve gone wrong but we are at once disgusted and pitying of Gollum frightened by his treachery but understanding of Frodos continued trust in him. He is the dark heart of the film. The other cast members also do fine job bringing the heart and emotion of Tolkiens text to the screen. There is tragedy and heroism in equal measure through to the films lump in throat climax. When you have these elements welded to some of the most stirring and powerful battle sequences put to celluloid picture thousands of horse riding warriors riding to battle tens of thousands of orcs and assorted monsters then you have a genuine classic. I can safely say this film will be loved for years to come and will sit well next to the likes of Casablanca. Ten out of Ten. I would give it more if that were possiblepositive,loved this movie..Im a big fan of Heath Ledger from his 10 things I hate about you days and will always and forever remain a fan of his acting The plot was great every actor/actress were phenomenal..especially Maggie G. as Rachel. So yeah maybe the batman didnt have to make his voice so deep but he definitely had to change it to separate himself from Bruce Wayne..I thought it was fitting. So..to the poster Mozared below me to answer your questions why did Dent turn bad and why didnt he kill the joker when he had the chance...Dent believed in fairness his entire life thats what he lived by...when things started to become unfair in his eyes such as his love being killed and his current predicament to him the only fairness that was left is flipping his coin. When he flipped it with the joker he landed on heads..the joker lives same with Maroni in the car scene and Ramirez. Even if it causes chaos like when you stated...him turning bad. The joker as well convinces him that chaos is fair as well as convincing him hethe joker was locked up at the time so Dent needs to go after the people who actually put him and Rachel in the warehouse. It was fairness in a sick way if you will. Basically Dent is just like Batman..he has rules he lives by. We all know what Batmans was and Dents rule was fairness. Now why does the joker have so many loyal men well its simple these men arent working with a full stack of cards And actually in the original series his men came from an asylum called Akhram...crazies bi-polar schizophrenics you name it. He was able to lure them to do bad things for him it wouldnt be that hard when theyre not well to begin with...as you saw with the guy Dent interrogated in the alley..Batman explained the joker feeds off these men. And lastly why is the Joker able to get around with explosives and no one noticing him....well he has too many people working for him that he bribes with money as we saw and you definitely dont think he set those traps up himself do you plus theyre cheap.positive,loved this movie the special effects were amazing and the acting was excellent especially matthew mcconaughey and jessica chastain hanz zimmer also did a tremendous job as always the  was mesmerizingi really enjoyed this movie and if your a scifi you will enjoy on some level this is a good movie i thought it was great but that is just my opinion some may say it is good or just okay but if you love movies and enjoy good stories that connect on an emotional level this is one such movie all i have left to say is dont listen to other reviewers go make your own opinions about the film please lastly i saw it in regular format and it was still impressive and im sure it is beautiful in imax but if you dont want to see it in imax you wont miss out on anythingpositive,love them all. Great movie and story Action magic and drama. The cast as they have been all the way are excellent.I am a massive fan of the first two films - I loved them.Frodo Baggins and Sam continue their quest to destroy the ring led by the untrustworthy Gollum. Meanwhile the rest of the Fellowship prepare for another battle to hold a human city against an onslaught of orc.Peter Jackson has done it. He has created an all-encompassing epic saga of Tolkiens Lord of the Rings books and after coming away from the final chapter Ive never seen a series like this. I must say that The Lord of the Rings is an amazingly powerful visual experience.As a film though this is amazing. A true lasting legacy in story telling and now cinema. Bravo Mr. Jacksonpositive,LOTR: Return of the king is an amazing movie. I saw the trilogy on December 16th and was very impressed. It was all that I expected and more. Obviously a must see but I think it was just that much better because I got to see all 3 one after the other. Hats off to Mr. Peter Jackson for a great interpretation of J.R.R. Tolkiens masterpiece.positive,LOTR 3 is one of the best movies ever made and all the Oscars it got were completely well deserved In fact i would add a couple. Viggo Mortensen Ian McKellen and Bernard Hill all deserved a Best Actor nomination. And i would also mention Sean Bean whos performance of Boromir in the first part was completely underrated It was a great performance and i cant believe he wasnt nominated I am usually a big fan of the books. Ive noticed that some people complain about Peter Jackson completely changing the dialog and some scenes. Its true. He did do that but i think its actually better this way. Dont get me wrong the books are magical. Its just that certain scenes and dialog would look and sound dull when seen on movies. Peter Jackson knew it and he had to make a certain changes. Im glad he did Visuals are revolutionary for the time and great for today writing is great directing is great acting is great cinematography is great make up is great costimography is great fighting choreography is great... and so on... and so on... All in all this movie is just brilliant One of the best movies ever to be made and definitely the best movie in its genre. Deserves all the awards and all the hype it got A TRUE MASTERPIECEpositive,Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King. Is an historic epic film in the modern age of Hollywood. The storyline is very well done. The Cinematography by Annie Collins and Jamie Selkirk was breathe taking. Director Peter Jackson and Frances Walsh has inspired young movie makers for the generations. Great story and screenplay. Four stars. Byron Warepositive,Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King is no doubt the best movie Ive seen. The film captures you instantly up to the words The End appearing on the screen. The Return of the King is nothing short of excitement. For all those who doesnt know what The Lord of the Rings is about Im thinking everybody does either through the books or the movies heres a brief summary: Just over 50 year ago J.R.R. Tolkien published a tale about a long dangerous quest to destroy 1 ring. This tale is split into 3 novels The Fellowship of the Rings The Two Towers and The Return of the King. This tale is called The Lord of the Rings. Nearly 50 years after the novels were published Peter Jackson tells the tale in another way by bringing it to life onto the big screen. This tale is about 9 peoples quest to destroy one magic ring and return peace to Middle-Earth. If this one ring goes back to its maker the evil Sauron the world will be under his control bringing death and misery everywhere. The only way to destroy this powerful ring is to cast it into the fires of Mount Doom where it was made. Only one hobbit could resist the temptation to keep the ring and this job was given to a hobbit named Frodo Baggins. To help him along the way a fellowship of nine people were brought together. In it was a wizard 2 men an elf a dwarf and three other hobbits. Together they set out for Mordor where Mount Doom is situated. Getting to Mordor is not as easy as it sounds. On the way theyll have to battle Orcs Uruk-hais giant spiders and other results of Tolkiens fascinating imagination. The Return of the King is the last addition to this vast trilogy. Peter Jackson does a great job in interpreting Tolkiens thoughts and feelings into a film. Watching the movies is just like reading the books themselves. If it was only the movies it wouldnt have made such an impact on the public. The music in all three films practically takes you on your very own journey and the acting from the actors was also very impressive. If anything was missing from these movies they just wouldnt have been such a success. Peter Jackson has done this to perfection. Overall this is a must-watch movie. Plenty of action and special effects not to mention a very heart warming ending to the trilogy. Ill just say one more thing dont criticise anything until you have saw heard or done it especially Lord of the Rings.positive,Lord of the Rings: Return of the King is the third film in the film trilogy The Lord of the Rings. It was released in December 2003 one year after the second film in this trilogy the two towers. Aspects like light and colour camera work and editing will be discussed and to sum everything up the conclusion will give a final verdict. In the third and final part of the Lord of the Ring Sam Frodo and Gollum continue their trip to Mordor to destroy the One Ring. At the same time Aragorn Gandalf and the remaining fellowship find out that Sauron is about to attack the city Minas Tirith. They try to gather a human army to battle. Then Gandalf finds out that Denethor the Steward of Gondor is mad with grief because of his son Boromir who died in the first film. Gandalf therefore leads the human army to give them a chance of winning the final battle. Aragorn finds personal motivation to win the battle as when Sauron is getting stronger his love Arwen is dying. To save her he must reclaim the throne and lead the human army against Sauron. But even with his new army to aid Frodo he still has to have the strength to destroy the ring that has enchanted him. But does he have the strength to do this The usage of light and color in this film is used particularly to accentuate the moods of various characters in the film and to immerse the viewer with the feelings felt by all characters. For instance the colors are dark when Aragorn Gimli and Legolas visit the city of the dead and even the brightly dressed characters seem rather bleak when inside the mountain. This changes the moment Aragorn whips out Andurill as the saturation seems to increase slightly at the moment. Especially when the eye of Sauron gazes at Aragorns army the harsh light and the colors bleak it may at first seem threatening but gives a feeling of hope and serenity as Aragorn says: For Frodo The overall lighting is quite dark and the colors particularly unsaturated with the exceptions of the happy moments of the characters. The way the cameras are used in this film is absolutely brilliant. As the director Peter Jackson refused to use CGI to make actors playing hobbits seem smaller compared to other actors he used optical illusions placing the hobbits further away while giving the audience the impression the actors mare standing next to each other. When it was not necessary to show the faces of both or multiple characters at the same time Peter would use scale doubles for the characters whose faces werent necessary. An example of this is Eowyn riding to war with Merry. As they are waiting to charge on the battlefield the shots only show Eowyns face with the top of Merrys helmet at the bottom of the screen or Merrys face with Eowyns torso behind him. The cameras are angled so perfectly that you wouldnt notice this the first time but would still remain non-intrusive to the entire experience even if you were to notice it. In this film special effects play a huge role and a total 2730 of special effects were used in the Lord of the Rings series were used of which 1477 in Return of the King. Special effects are the main reasons this film has been released such a long time after the animated series as the technology was not present or too expensive to create visual effects as flying dragons or even many scenes which were filmed in front of a green screen and the d’©cor was later added in the studio. The biggest example of an incredibly necessary and important special effect is the by all loved Sm’©agol. The special effects help accentuate the mystical feeling you get by all the happenings that are impossible in real life. Once again great care has been taken to carefully adjust the film in such a way that the film is perfect and balanced correctly. During conversations reverse-shots were occasionally used to get as much involved in the conversation as possible as you experience it as if you are actually amongst the characters and joining the conversation. Whenever the action commences the average shot length decreases. This means that before the action the shots are fairly long but as the action starts to build up the shots get shorter and shorter to create the feeling of chaos and excitement. The shots are transitioned in such a way that the audience gets more curious to what will happen and what really happened since the shot are so abruptly ended/ In conclusion we have all enjoyed this great film as the plot was great and the cast perfectly chosen. The acting was of high quality and it was also the best adaptation of a book we had seen so far which cant be said about a lot of recent films. The camera-work and editing was done perfectly and the light and color was just right at every moment and the special effects were staggering. We also loved the original soundtrack as it dragged us deeper into the film making it an unforgettable journey through Middle Earth for us. Together we came to the conclusion that this film was worth a ten out of ten and fully deserved all awards it had received.positive,Lord of the Rings-The Return of the King is surely the greatest movie ever made. I consider that is has the most fascinating plot ever written.The universe of the movie is unique: a fantastic world which includes almost every mythical creature we heard of. Elvesorcstrollshobbitsall these make up a charming atmosphere. The idea of a Ring that can submit the will of its bearer is surely unique is recalls all throughout the movie.Also the love story between Aragorn and the immortal Arwen is the most original one seen in the entire history of movies. The fate of king Debethor reminds us of Greek tragedies and the film contains great moral learningsmost in the words of the wizard Gandalf. The fantasy and the charming sublime atmosphere make me consider this movie the greatest work or art ever created by mankind.positive,Lord of the Rings the Return of the King is arguably the best movie in the history of movies. It is almost perfect if not perfect. Peter Jackson will go down as one of the greatest Producer/Director of all time. So many times we see great books series butchered on the big screen but not this time. This is 2nd best movie series of all time the only reason its not first is because Star Wars wasnt a book before the movies which made it a little harder to make. But if you are just looking at how well each movie was it is the best series of all time. Im not gonna go into much detail because I feel like a review on here should just let the person that is reading it know if the movie is good or not. If you have seen the first 2 than get ready to be blown away. Finally you get to see what happens to the ring and all the characters responsible for getting the ring to the place they can destroy it. Will they get there If they do will they lose anybody else What happens Trust me watch this movie along with all of your questions being answered you will also witness one of the greatest movies ever if not the greatest.positive,Like I did a few years back you might be hesitating about watching this film. The title didnt appeal to me and neither did the subject matter so it was only by chance that I started to watch it. I can only say that the film was a revelation for me and has stayed with me ever since. There are so many dark and hopeless films out there which whilst they leave an impression leave the wrong one i.e that there is no hope in life. Watch this film and be uplifted and be encouraged by the message...that there is ALWAYS hope....in any situation. Please watch this film and the watch it again. Its a great answer to all the cynicism that is out there.positive,Like a beautifully crafted French wine this movie keeps getting better and better with every passing year. Every time I have viewed it over the past decade and it must be at least more than 20 times by now I have found newer shades subtler indications and deeper meanings. And it has amazed me like very few have. * No overacting * Humour in the drab hopeless environs of Shawshank * Method in the madness of running the scams from inside * The complete secrecy maintained for 20 years not even Red knew * The best that a highly-educated intellectual could do inside such a prison * What a great actor the Warden turned out to be - totally despicable * What a bunch of speakable quotes.. what a bunch * Totally recommended for any young person - students especially * HOPE TRULY IS THE BEST OF THINGS - a message that shines throughpositive,Lets open this review with the fact that Batman is THE BEST superhero ever with no other even coming close to his levels. So when a sequel is made for an unforgettable movie like Batman Begins expectations are EXTREMELY high. I think that if you could describe this movie in a few words it would be 152 minutes of pure awesomeness. Christopher Nolan probably created the best ever comic book adaptation of a movie. The movie itself has been adapted in a much more realistic fashion than the comic book series. First of all this movie is PERFECT for people who like punches drama shooting and explosions. The movie has a complicated plot that keeps your eyes glued to the screen. Its anything BUT corny since a few important characters die and the ending isnt happy but its flawless. Christian Bale has proved himself one again as an amazing actor. Michael Cane portrays Alfred Pennyworth makes you fall in love with Batmans loyal butler. Now anyone that has seen the movie and is reading this review is probably wondering why I havent mentioned the main reason why this movie is flawless. And yes there is ONE main reason: Heath Ledger. Heath Ledger portrayed Batmans arch nemesis in this movie: the Joker. Now anyone who has a clue in comic books knows that the Joker is INCREDIBLE. Heath Ledgers acting in this movie has turned the Joker into a LEGEND. I have never seen such perfect and realistic acting than the portrayal of the Joker in this movie. The Joker is portrayed in a much more mature fashion than the comic books and thats why it was so good. Its simply impossible to describe him: hes bold insane smart twisted and hes so awesome in this film that at some points you love him even more than Batman. If I havent mentioned it by now this is without a doubt the best movie I have seen.Those who come with high expectations after seeing Batman Begins will not be disappointed. I advise that no one under the age of 11 watches this movie as Two-Faces appearance is rather frightening and the film contains intense action.positive,Lets get straight to the point. The plot is set out to perfection. it doesnt rush itself and tells the story brilliantly. The way it elegantly portrays the jokers sick humour when threatening the 2 boats containing prisoners and citizens. not to mention the tension when one boat has to blow up the other leaves you hanging on the edge of your seat. The film also shows that batman is shown not be a unbeatable hero and has a side of realism that christopher nolan directs really well. But my favourite thing about the dark knight is the excellent acting of the late heath ledger and his role of the joker is quirky sinister and what makes the dark knight one of my favourite films of all time.positive,Lets begin by stating that this movie should only be watched in IMAX. If you are a big Batman fanatic spend a couple extra dollars and youll get your moneys worth. This is the best movie of 2008 no other film will come close. Christopher Nolan has made his masterpiece with the help of his brother Jonathan creating the script. The perfect balance between superhero action and drama can be found here in The Dark Knight. The acting is top-notch. Not a single actor in this movie comes up short. Christian Bale portrays Batman better than he did in its predecessor. Aaron Eckhart impresses with his take of Harvey Dent. Maggie does a fantastic job playing the role of Rachel Dawes. Heath Ledger is Oscar worthy in his attempt at the infamous Batman rival The Joker. Ledgers performance is just absolutely stunning. No words can describe how much he attracts the viewer and shines on the big screen. There is no reason why anyone should say this movie was bad. Those who gave this movie a poor rating should be ashamed of themselves for their lack of intelligence. Yes I said. LACK OF INTELLIGENGE Even if your not a Batman fanatic this film has a meaning and purpose. It will give you excitement and also something to ponder about for the rest of the day night morning etc. No spoilers but its lengthy running time of 152 minutes beats the hell out of any other superhero comic book adaptation previously made and for years to come. Ledgers stunning acting portrayal of the Joker is good enough for you to spend the money. Do not wait for it to come out on DVD WATCH IT IN IMAXpositive,Let me start out by saying that this is one of my personal all time favorites and as such I may be a bit bias whole reviewing it. On the other hand theres a reason its a personal favorite. The movie revolves around the wrongly imprisonment of Andy Dufrane played by Tim Robbins for the murder of his wife. The story focuses on Andys life in prison relationships with other inmates particularly with Red played perfectly by Morgan Freeman and passion for life and freedom. I recently had an argument with one of them regarding this movie. He claimed it was too plain to be considered so great  in another story he is with his partner Jules Winnfield Samuel L. Jackson trying to transmit a message to a group of guys who owns money to Marcellus Wallace  in another story he only makes an appearance in which is actually the story of Butch Coolidge Bruce Willis a fighter who works Marcellus Wallace which after a fight which was supposed to lose he tries to flee the country with his French girlfriend Fabienne Maria de Medeiros. Many other characters form the movie mixing in stories each one with a different theme but all have something alike long dialogs. The film features unprecedented writing addresses several topics some do not have anything to do with the stories and the situations of the characters but the way they are written in a way so simple and interesting is really from a true master on writing screenplays that is Quentin Tarantino. Despite having had help from Roger Avary on the screenplay this time but all the ideas are still from Tarantinos mind keeping his good dark-humor and his bloody fun violence. The film with so many stories Tarantino mixes the different chapters leaving them out of order. Not to leave more confused but to leave the film more entertaining and extremely interesting with the insane dialogs between characters. A legendary film excellent performances perfect writing with interesting stories covering various topics and all very entertaining. Undoubtedly the best Tarantino film a classic and a legendary masterpiece.positive,Let me start by telling this I think this movie is the best movie ever made. There are different reasons for that conclusion and part of it certainly is due to the buildup this movie had with the first 2 other movies. I think this movie is much better than both of them though. It pretty much everything a movie needs to have IMO. It has good storytelling great characters outstanding visuals and good pacing which is something I found the other 2 movies to be missing. What can be said about the story obviously is that it is giant. There are stories that take place on a smaller scale where only small things are at risk and I am not saying these stories are worse in fact if theyre done right they can be better but I also like stories that tackle a giant worldwide danger. This is what all of the LOTR movies do they deal with something that threatens pretty much the entire world. The good storytelling in it is that we find different people in this situation and they all come together through some circumstances which of course happens in the first movie not this one. What we get in this movie is those characters working together to solve this one problem. They all do serve a purpose in solving the problem and the story does a good job to show why they do. That is good storytelling that is how you tell a giant story right. And also the way it ended is great. Then we have the characters. We have a lot of different characters in LOTR. We have people like Aragorn who are in self doubt although this isnt really present in the books. I think its a great addition to the story which they manage to lose in the end and which makes them get to the peak of their power. This is what we get to see in Return of the King. We finally see Aragorn actively deciding that he will take his rightful throne and he does what he needs to do to deserve it. On the other hand we have characters that are like Legolas the knight in shining armor kind. We do also have crazy people Denethor we have people like Sam who are just very loyal. What I am getting to is that those characters all seem believable to me which is what makes a good character. The best example would be Frodo who also is in a constant struggle because of the ring. His story is a great story about a guy that is not big enough for the task hes up against which is a sad story. The good thing on that part is that everyone else got their happy end but Frodo didnt because Frodo basically failed. This characters are interesting. So lets talk about the visuals. My favorite scene of the trilogy from the cinematic standpoint is in this movie. It is when the riders of Rohan attack the Ork army in front of Minas Tirith. It is just a very beautiful scene. From an artistic standpoint it is brilliantly made. What gives this scene a lot of power is the horn that announces it. When you hear that horn you have a slight idea of what youre going to get. You get the fact that Rohan is arriving but to see it play out on the screen to see them ride down those hills being bombarded by arrows and crushing through the pikes of the Orks was the most beautiful thing I have ever seen on a screen. If I have ever been close to an orgasm while watching a movie it was during this scene because this scene is epic. Now to the pacing. This movie does pacing in a better way than the other 2. What makes the difference is that noting in Return of the King seems irrelevant to the story. Yes it is long. But the length this movie has is filled up with relevant stuff and everything seems very important which is why it doesnt stretch as much as the other 2 movies do. It feels shorter although it is massively longer. This is quite an impressive thing. Now those are my reason for liking this movie. I truly think that it probably isnt the best in any of the categories I mentioned but I think it combines them in the best way. The complete package of The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King is bigger and better than that of any other movie which makes it the best movie I have ever watched. If there was any way to give it more than 10/10 I would definitely do that but I will have to stick to a 10/10.positive,ladys and gentleman oscar season has officially begun with gone girl and i would be shocked if it doesnt take a oscar or few especially rosamund pike holy cow she steals this movie sorry affleck your good shes great dont forget the masterful eye of david fincher ben affleck is good tyler perry is surprisingly good after those madea movies he gets this neil patrick harris is good anyone you see is good and the twists and intense is no less than great this is one of the best movies i seen in while certainly best movie so far as this year but its going to be tough to beat gone girl i got to say i did see one twist but it was only like a minute before they shown it i couldnt stop watching it i didnt want it to end and thats the only movie i ever saw to say that and i have to praise this movie for this achievement and thank you for making this movie thank youpositive,kingsman the secret service is anything but an average action film or average spy film its much more the film genuinely blew my mind because of its take on modern day action spy films the comedy tint was absolutely brilliant  if there werent as many funny scenes it still would have been good but just not as good as it was i loved it taron egerton is great in the film as the main protagonist  eggsy the film revolves around the young man who trains to become the next kingsman colin firth was the most standout character alongside taron egerton colin firth was incredible in this film  sheer fantastic acting also its good knowing that we had so many great costars in the film the likes of samuel l jackson mark strong mark hamill and michael caine woah what a fantastic cast i enjoyed everyones role but my favourite in particular was probably colin firth as galahad samuel l jackson was funny in the movie and played a rather unusual yet interesting and good villain valentine i seemingly enjoyed every single thing about the movie  the opening the soundtrack the acting the visuals the comedy the action the little scenes of romance  the whole film was outstanding and so unique i say unique as in its take is so completely different from other generic action films or the simple spy film you get now and again and yes i liked this movie better than any james bond filmwith maybe the exception of moonraker and a few others nonetheless kingsman is an unexpected comedy joyride that explores inner levels of action adventure comedy and more i hope you go and see the movie  i hope you enjoy it simply inexplicably goodpositive,Keeping the high standards set in the first two parts and upping the ante in terms of detailed action sequences and effects - but never disappearing up its own arse like those god-awful Matrix sequels. This is sheer stunning edge-of-your-seat cinema that demands to be experienced on a very big screen. I appreciated the gradual coming down as this film - and the epic series - concludes. Its button-pushingly emotional - but rightly so weve been through one hell of an adventure. I stayed to listen to Annie Lennox sing and to view the names of all the cast and crew whove done their very best to make this tale a reality. They deserve utmost praise and sincere gratitude. Kudos too to Christopher Lee - who may not have made the initial theatre-release cut but who was none the less there in spirit. Im hoping the extended DVD will include his contributions.positive,Keeping in mind that the two previous movies are really all meant as a complete picture I can truely say that this is a masterpiece. Like the books that the movies are based on the movies are not always perfect in a traditional movie sense nor do they confine themselves to traditional filmaking. I have read the books three times now and yet PJ and his team has manaaged to keep me on the edge of my seat and feel anxious when the characters or in peril... I do know certain aspects were left out including Sauraman and the love blossoming between Faramir and Eowyn. With that said though PJ made sure he did the theatrical version true to the books in the sense that we are never torn from the main characters of this story. I do have to say however that the real test will come when we have all three extended cuts of these movies and watch them in a marathon of 12 hours and watch them flow into one another. I cant wait 10/10  this movie has it all. If you love a movie that energizes all of your senses then check this one out. This truly is American film making at its finest. positive,just watched richard linklaters film boyhood a picture that was shot over 12 years and its done so great as the viewer sees the main character masonin a super performance from ellar coltrane change and grow up over that period on screen as time changes things and people it starts in texas with young masoncoltraneat the age of 5 and hes your typical little cute boy with an older sister and its typical with the problems of life his mom and dadpatricia arquette and ethan hawkeare divorced and thru the film its a tale of journey and change as soon masons mom gets married and divorced again while becoming a teacher and even dad marries and becomes a father again and the change of address is common for mason and his sister during it all a young man discovers life is about pain like and dislike with trips family and birthdays as age and time changes it all one finds out about life thru time age and change overall beautiful film one of time and coming of age while learning life and discovery is so common with time and changepositive,Just like the two previous this one explores a action packed adventure/fantasy world with a extremely well crafted story line thanks to JRR Tolkien books. Not every adaptation from book to movie lives up to the hype but lets just say this one is relatively close. If Tolkien was alive today i think he would certainly be pleased about the outcome of this brilliant trilogy. This movie has all the right elements andis a boys dream and the entertainment value makes this move next to perfect for its genre. I dont need to brag the movie speaks for it self. Eleven Oscars is all time record high and only two other movies has reached that benchmark. This is a true adventure classic and i truly envy those who have not yet seen this remarkable movie they have a amazing movie experience awaiting them. Enjoy 9.3/10positive,just and outstanding film really good plot great action the type of film you want to sit in to watch with your mates or girlfriend i just cant say it enough holy f*** i love this freaking film just love the way colin firth portrayed harry in the comics and samuel l jackson made it better by just showing up in the film as well as mark hamill with a surprising entrance so this makes me want to go and see the star wars film more hahahaha overall the kingsman is and outstanding film and i cant wait for the sequel i just love the work of matthew vaughn like kick ass for examplepositive,John Travolta got all the press but its Samuel Jackson who provides the snap crackle & poppositive,John Travolta & Samuel L Jackson at their best Four stories one great film The small time robbers Tim Roth & Amanda Plummer The gangsters John Travolta & Samuel L Jackson The gangsters wife Uma Thurman The boxer Bruce Willis & Ving Rhames In my opinion Quentin Tarantinos best film You will need to watch this movie more than once to truly appreciate just how good it is You will see something new each time you watch it The dialogue is natural convincing and witty there are so many great characters in this film it difficult to pick any one The main characters in all four stories give excellent performances but so do the supporting characters such as the drug dealer and his girlfriend The shop owner and police officer Harvey Keitel as the Wolf Christopher Walken as Captain Koonspositive,J. R. R. Tolkien was one of my first fantasy writers that I have ever read. I have read this book many times so when this film came out it was like a birthday present to me. The 1978 animated Lord of the Rings at least gave me something to visualize but with Peter Jacksons version I felt like Dorothy waking up in the land of OZ for the first time. The filming was great even with all of the CGI content. Great actors will make this film a long-time favorite for fans of the books and those who have only seen the films. A great movie has details and in The Return of the King you can appreciate the details and history that is brought out by the characters in their words and actions. I absolutely love the scene when the Witch King is defeated I remember the audience in the theater cheering when this took place. Even at the end when the Hobbits are honored it still brings a tear to my eyes. I have watched these movies over 100 times already and I am always ready to watch it again. I use these three films every time we play games as background music.  the serious violence of American gangster movies crime movies and films noise mixed up with the wacky violence of cartoons video games and Japanese animation  and the fragmented story-telling structures of such experimental classics as Citizen Kane Rashomon and La Joete. The Oscar-winning script by Tarantino and Roger Avary intertwines three stories featuring Samuel L. Jackson and John Travolta in the role that single-handedly reignited his career as hit men who have philosophical interchanges on such topics as the French names for American fast food products  Bruce Willis as a boxer out of a 1940s B-movie  and such other stalwarts as Harvey Keitel Tim Roth Christopher Walken Eric Stoltz Ving Rhames and Uma Thurman whose dance sequence with Travolta proved an instant classic. positive,Ive watched this film several times and I really enjoy it I think films wouldnt be the same nowadays without Tarantino I fell in love with Tarantino with this film and I started watching all of his works including the films that werent directed by him This is his best motion picture and its one of those films that you just cant miss like The Godfather or Irr’©versible or A Clockwork Orange or The Shining You may say it sounds stupid but to me this film has the soul of the Western ones You can see in it all the references of the best pictures ever made It has great violence the good one the one that Tarantino talks about when he says that movies were made to violence and nothing elsepositive,Ive watched this about 20 times now and im captivated from start to finish every time. Its a gripping emotionally draining and exciting film. Id go far to say that it is the greatest film of all time. Along with the best trilogy of all time. This film set a new standard in film making and Jackson is probably the most sort after Director going thanks to this movie. You have to really watch the last film as it starts straight after the last one had finished. Frodos task is hanging on a knife edge has he starts to lose strength and his trust in Gollum grows to strong. Andy Serkis and WETA do an absolutely fantastic job of Gollum once again. He looks extremely realistic once again and really plays a big part in the film. I thought the expansive scenery and battles added to the brilliance and build up towards the end. In particular the battle of Pelannor fields just left me jaw-dropped at how brilliant it was filmed. Some of the huge backdrops played a big part also I.E. the part where Gandalf finally sees Minis Tirith. You feel very involved throughout the film with Frodos quest. Jackson creates the sense of pity fantastically on the viewer regarding Gollum. The only issue i have was Jackson did squeeze to many endings together making them feel a lot less emotional on the viewer. I thought it was awfully sad when Frodo passed into the west and they should of just left it at that however it was a lot to cram in and i think 3 hours of film was absolutely masterful. Its hard to review a film with so many qualities and very few faults. If you look at professional critics they will agree at how good this film is 11 Oscars well done and more awards. The most solid 10/10 ive ever given.positive,Ive watched all films that Tarantino directed but for me this Pulp Fiction is the best of all of them Its a little bit difficult to explain this movie This looks like a omnibus and consists of prologue  three stories and epilogueThey seem to be disconnected but after watching everything is connected Prologue is about a couple planning to burgle a restaurant and two man from Mafia Vincent and Jules  They takes a order from their boss Marsellus to collect his possessions First story is about Vincent and Marselluss wife Vega He is asked to take care of her by Marsellus Second is about one boxer who refuses to order to lose on purpose Third is about Vincent and Jules again They happen to kill a man and asks a professional to solve Epilogue is also them at a restaurant If theres a word describes this movie it must be crazy in a good sense All of the stories are completely crazy full of sex talks and violence and theres no message from this However I do love this craziness I have to admit that Tarantino really has a great sense of humor and is good at creating wonderful characters Particularly I like Jules acted by Samuel Jackson Im fascinated by his way of speak and the scene he recites Ezekiel 25:17 Its imprinted on my mind Also I think conversations of this movie are really amusing Theyre meaningless and not important but For instance one about hamburger is awesome Every time after watching I come to want to eat a hamburger The story I like most is second The scene Bruce Willis and Ving Rhames get caught and they kick asses of stupid two young guys is amazing This is a cheap B movie But its waste to miss this sophisticated story  direction like music and enjoyable acting After watching you may feel refreshing and have a desire to watch againpositive,Ive seen this film on IMDb so many times before on so many peoples lists. But I just ignored it because I thought it was not what I was looking for. When I finally decided to see it I immediately regretted not watching it any sooner. The film is heartbreaking and frustrating from the start but in the end you would truly feel redemption. You could feel the pain and injustice brought upon Andy the protagonist. As I watched the movie I felt as if I was in prison with him  we get Guy Ritchie and Jeremy Clarkson. Travolta and Samuel L Jackson play Vincent and Jules a couple of bantering hit men working for Marsellus Ving Rhames who is highly protective of his wife Mia Uma Thurman and about to conclude a payday from a fixed boxing match  Marselluss fighter Butch Bruce Willis is haunted by a childhood encounter with his late fathers best friend a jaw-dropping cameo from Christopher Walken. Everyones destiny plays out with that of a couple of freaky stick-up artists played by Amanda Plummer and Tim Roth. In 1994 all the talk was of former video-store clerk Tarantinos indifference to traditional culture. That patronised his sophisticated cinephilia and in fact 20 years on the writerly influences of Edward Bunker Elmore Leonard and Jim Thompson seem very prominent. Don DeLillo began the 90s by warning that the US is the only country in the world with funny violence. Maybe Pulp Fiction was the kind of thing he had in mind. Unmissable.positive,Ive seen this film many times before  and every time I watch it it just seems to get better There really is nothing bad I have to say about this film  because the overlying message of the film is infinite  and its just such a timeless classic . I cant imagine the movie without Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman in their respective roles so bravo to them  because ultimately these two characters are the heart of the story. While there are some scenes that truly stand out to me  you just need to do yourself a favour a watch this amazing film. Its one of the best of all time and I can promise you that you will enjoy it positive,Ive seen The Dark Knight many times. Once you start watching it you just cant stop. -Batman Begins was the perfect change for the usual Batman - atmosphere. - -It was easy for us to accept things in The Dark Knight because of the first movie. -The Dark Knight was the best of the trilogy because of Heath Ledger. -The Dark Knight Rises was surely one of the best movies in 2012. But honestly without The Dark Knight the trilogy wouldnt have been nearly as popular as it is now. Also Christopher Nolans name suddenly is all over the planet.positive,Ive seen a lot of movies in my day and a lot I have said are the best ever but Pulp Fiction has to be the best The way this movie depicts the world of LA crime is like no other ever will the unique way the stories are told will never be matched The way scares the heck out of you so fast then makes you burst out in laughter is awesome The way Tarentino built up the characters it felt like you knew all them personally And finally the cast the cast was absolutely perfect for this movie  I mean who else could have played Jules except Samuel L In conclusion see Pulp Fiction it will be like no other movie youve ever seen if you are worried about the language it fits in with the movie so when you think about it its not really that bad positive,Ive read a lot of the comments here. Ive never voted for this movie once but now Im going to give it what it deserves. And I am going to try to describe why a lot of Shawshank fans are voting this the best movie ever. The reasons that this movie is great are: it has incredible acting incredible story-telling incredible pace incredible writing and dialogue incredible imagery and an incredible twist and ending. The Godfather also has these qualities. But the reason Shawshank is better is because it literally is potentially life-changing. People watch Shawshank and someone truly may believe in HOPE. They may truly believe their lives will get better. They may truly believe others lives can be made better. Its message is not only told but it is FELT and oft times ABSORBED. For men for women for old for young for everyone. It is a masterpiece. What other movie affects people in this way You dont get that with The Godfather. GF is a great film but you just come out of it saying Wow that was one of the best films Ive ever seen. With Shawshank you say more than that. You feel more than that. You will never see another like it. And the mere perfection of this movie by a novice director will frustrate experienced and future directors forever.  its an epic in the class of The Ten Commandments or Gone with the Wind but with lots more fighting. And what fighting it is The combat scenes capture the full intensity and brutality of medieval warfare of pounding clubs and maces bodies impaled with spears and arrows or crushed beneath catapult stones Within the bounds of PG-13. Yet theres also is the precision even beauty of Aragorns swordsmanship and Legeloss skill with the bow their ability to fell an enemy with every swing of the sword or release of an arrow. And then theres the sheer scale of it all. The climactic battle of Pelenor Fields is the largest ever filmed with dozens of siege engines more than two-hundred thousand orcs and a charge by six thousand horsemen. There are few sights that can surpass six thousand armored cavalrymen at full charge but a counter charge by a line of mumukhiel is surely one of them. Add the piercing shrieks of fell beasts and an army of vengeful dead and you have perhaps the greatest spectacle ever to grace the screen. This may seem hyperbole or even heretical but Cecil B. Demile has nothing on Peter Jackson. Im also highly impressed with the effects and technical aspects of this movie. The set pieces are among the largest and grandest Ive seen and the models have a nearly unprecedented attention to detail. And there are thousands of weapons orc masks and suits of armor all beautifully Š—– or gruesomely- done. Few projects can equal this one in the costume and make-up departments. New Zealands Weta Workshop might just be the new Industrial Light and Magic. Now obviously all this was already present in the original version. So you may ask if this new version is worth paying to see especially if you already have the original. My answer: absolutely. Theres more humor exemplified by a side-splitting drinking contest and more character development especially with Faramir and Denathor. And theres lots more action including Gandalfs encounter with the Witch King a longer fight scene with Gollum and far more material with the dead men of Dun-Harrow. Jackson has also included important vignettes from the book like the House of Healing scene and negotiations with the Mouth of Sauron. And I particularly enjoyed Christopher Lees death scene near the beginning. Bottom line Lord of the Rings Return of the King is one of the grandest most exciting and most inspiring movies youll ever witness. Try as I might I can find no fault with it. You owe it to yourself to see this movie especially in its new and improved state. positive,Ive never seen a series like this. A trilogy of movies created with such love and care and utter perfection of craft that you cant help but walk away and wonder how did Peter Jackson make this possible I have always loved the original Star Wars and Indiana Jones series for their epic storytelling and just for just fitting in as a great moment in cinema. This should be will be remembered with as much revered fondness for generations to come. They do not make films like these anymore. As a stand alone film it picks up immediately where Two Towers ends so brush up before seeing it. Ive read the books and the anticipation of seeing some of the more profound moments in this film made me kind of view it with a rushed sense of perspective. I wanted to make sure everything in this film was done right. And when it happened it was. I will need to see this again to enjoy everything on a more casual level. The cast comes through once more. The musical  retains its beauty elegance and power. The special effects notably Gollum again are nothing less than breathtaking and simply move the story along. The battles are monumentally huge and exciting. There are some liberties taken with the story especially during the end with the homecoming and yet everything that needed to be covered regarding the main characters was handled. After the greatest moment of the series resolves itself the story provided a breather. And gives a good-bye to friends seen on screen for the last three years. It was truly a bittersweet feeling in realizing that there will be no Rings movie in 2004. I will miss this talented group of actors. As with the first two the film is very long but goes by without you ever truly realizing it. This film is so much more than a simple fantasy epic. Its a story about strength of character friendship loyalty and love. And while every member of the Fellowship has their part to play I finally understood why some critics have said this series is a story about Sam. Its his unwavering resolve that led the quest to its victory. Sean Astin is a true credit for adding the inspirational heart to this epic. As as far as the ending goes they ended it the way that it had to be ended. Jackson ended this film the way it should have been. I will miss looking forward to a new Rings movie but these movies provide hope that high-quality films can still be made without special effects taking over a story bathroom humor or a Top 40 soundtrack. George Lucas could learn a lot from these films about how not to alienate the fan base. Each film has earned a 10 from me for the last two years which for me to give is a rarity. This one however is as equally deserving as its two predecessors. The Academy had better not look over this film for Best Picture of 2003. To do so would be greatly disrespectful of the craft and care that anyone involved with these films put into them.positive,Ive never seen a series like this.

I will need to see this again to enjoy everything on a more casual level.positive,Ive never really been a major fan of superhero films they all seem too similar and they generally get boring after a while but Batman: Dark Knight stunned me. Fantastic acting- particularly from Heath Ledger R.I.P. and Christian Bale- made the film thrilling and suspenseful. The storyline setting and props where spot on and really made Gotham City seem as realistic as possible. The film was also quote galore with the Joker adding an utterly menacing atmosphere to the film. In terms of character development Harvey Dent was portrayed brilliantly originally being an authoritative policing figure who ultimately ended up as Two-Face a wreckless broken-hearted villain. The ending was also thrilling leaving it open and adding an air of mystery as to what was going to happen next with the final showdown also hinting at another Batman film. However Batman: Dark Knight rises was a great film but Batman: Dark Knight is the better of the two. A must see filmpositive,Ive just been to see a preview screening of The Dark Knight. Now Im no film reviewer/critic/whatever but this film blew me away. Blah blah blah on all the performances they were brilliant Heath Ledger is a truly psychotic Joker As one of his final performances he will be remembered as a villain who thrived on kaos and mayhem. Maggie Gyllenhall Christain Bale Gary Oldman Michael Caine Morgan Freeman and Aaron Erkhart all gave such Oomph to their roles. Technically the movie was fantastic. With all the explosions you expect and the body count wasnt too high. May be a little too much for children under 13 to grasp. Go see it. Go on Buy your tickets nowpositive,Ive heard of this movie before i saw it to be honest not a single disagree on the perfectness of the actors or the production or the story or the dialogue man when i saw it i agreed and supported it to the last very minute its one of the best movies i ever watched and it really deserve to the 1st top movie in the American cinemas history ... Id like to thank all the people who worked in or share in it i give it up for their great effort that will last in every ones memory for his life time. Im sorry for my weak expression as I am impressed and my words may fail me I did my best to deliver what i think. Hope to see new production with this kind of quality and this kind of mastering in every single detail.positive,Ive decided that there are two types of people in this world: people who get Pulp Fiction and people who dont I feel very sorry for the people who dont This is one of the funniest most enjoyable two hours Ive ever spent in a theater I went into it halfway expecting not to like it and I came out a rabid fan Samuel L Jackson is the finest actor in film today and this movie is responsible for putting him on the map Not to mention jump-starting the career of John Travolta Sure theres lots of violence and profanity--but thats what makes the movie Im not one of those die-hard Tarantino fans either I hated Reservoir Dogs Ugh My other favorite movie along with this one is When Harry Met Sally Hows that for diversity I dont understand how anyone could NOT like this movie Its been imitated many times since but when it came out it was very different than anything else that had been done If you find it hard to follow the first time watch it again Youll understand the back-and-forth-in-time concept then Every performance in it was great--and it has many lines that will be quoted for years to come I couldve done without Ving Rhames rape scene but other than that it was perfect 5 out of 5 starspositive,Ive always been a fan of the Batman legacy and when the hype was going around about Batman Begins and a fresh start for the Caped Crusader since Tim Burtons movies I was looking forward to the movie. But at the movies ending a sequel was guaranteed. When I went to see The Dark Knight on the day of its release I thought it was brilliant a great sequel Christopher Nolan did an amazing job once again. Christian Bale was excellent as Bruce Wayne/Batman again Aaron Eckhart was also brilliant as Harvey Dent/Two-Face he made that part his own and pulled off the good guy District Attorney role brilliant and he pulled off the evil coin flipping Two-Face brilliant also so I can only applaud Aaron on a brilliant performance. The person who stole the show was the late Heath Ledger as The Joker. When it was announced that Heath was to portray the Clown Prince everyone was unsure on Nolans choice of actor including myself. But Heath proved everyone wrong he did a brilliant job as The Joker. With Jack Nicholsons unforgettable performance in The Jokers first big screen appearance to compete with and no doubt Nicholson is a superb actor a true legend. But as much as Nicholson did a good job as The Joker Heath Ledgers performance puts Nicholsons in the shadows. To change the character from Nicholsons joke filled funny man persona to Ledgers sick twisted psychopathic persona was brilliant and the actor pulled it off brilliant. The way he captured the insane clown personality was perfect the character was brilliant taken away from your normal villain who robs banks for money trying to take over the world blah blah blah... But Ledgers Joker was the villain who if he had the money hed burn it like in the movie he dont care for world domination Jokers only interest was to as Michael Caines Alfred line goes Some men want to watch the world burn which is what Joker wanted he dont care for anything or anybody not even himself. Which was genius his performance as the Joker will go down in history as one of the best and will not be forgot for a long time. As for the rumours going around on the net on threads saying Nolan should cast the Joker character in a 3rd Batman Movie if there will be a 3rd I think they shouldnt cast another Joker even though the Joker wasnt killed off at the end of The Dark Knight they shouldnt re-cast a Joker for a 3rd because I dont think that any actor in the business can fill Ledgers boots as Joker. Even though there are some brilliant actors out there they should introduce new villains for a 3rd and let the superb performance Heath Ledger gave us be remembered for what it was... Excellent And just adding Ive read some threads and rumours surrounding a 3rd movie about Philip Seymour Hoffman as Penguin and Johnny Depp as Riddler for one Hoffman is a brilliant actor and would be brilliant in the part. Depp dont need my praise his work speaks for itself the man is amazing. So Id give the nod to those two for those roles but the rumours around about a possible return for Eckharts character Dent/Two-Face would be good too with Eckhart still playing the role but if they keep Eckhart as Two-Face they should cast another villain and not cramp it up with too many characters like Spider Man 3 did which was poor. Anyway Brilliant movie amazing work from Nolan brilliant performances from the cast mainly Ledger and heres to a 3rd movie. Rest In Peace Heath Ledgerpositive,ive already mentioned that david fincher is one of my favorite directors and i think that next to christopher nolan are both of my favorites of the moment when i learned that gone girl would be the new finchers movie without reading the eponymous novel by gillian flynn i hitch with want to see you because he called me much attention to the kind of story that was because it is not just a suspected murder and i think its a movie that although many will say is to see it once because the surprise no longer exist in a second chance i personally did not see it couldnt praise fincher is one of the most known to the hour of handle stories with murders and this is no exception go way to adapt the great novel of flynn perhaps even so is still the movie without that fincher or is in the hands of another director would suffer less than any other of its repertoire even so it seems to me the task of effective fincher with the staging and on with the address in general perhaps it is not looks with the camera as it has done for zodiac 2007 perhaps not his best film but the best directed by him although raises too much the first material of which it has at its disposal in that area has not gone girl dodging decadence notorious or much less ben affleck and rosamund pike is look as ever especially the first because in my opinion never before vi as sober and speaking of pike an oscar nomination does not surprise me at all in conclusion with this the best performance for both since fincher worked with two actors who in their past does not have to wide acclaim beyond the indent shared of ben affleck and matt damon in good will hunting 1997 which led them to be crowned as the statuette for best original screenplay oscar however lucidity for both and i think more of pikes side that at times she steals the movie with her interpretation together with its director it seems that things are made easier too besides fincher makes affleck seems like a good actor with his interpretation of nick dunne but nor is it to diminish the afflecks interpretation because it is clear that this time he made it gone girl develops in any moment things with calm and does not reach to sacrificing too much that is why the surprises are functional and integrated into the story in an extraordinary way work on the creation of atmosphere is another of the strengths of the film as is worth by moments of a purely environmental music accurate and full of mystery really what works wonderfully and helps a lot with the burden of suspense that we all want to see perhaps many leave surprised after the outcome because it is not for less however many criticize its particular end which in my opinion it is just perfect in fact there is a great honor to everything that has been the whole movie i am not sure to say that gone girl is the best of fincher because i have in the head seven 1995 andor the fight club 1999 but what if i am sure of is that so far is the best of the year and could not be otherwise with fincherpositive,Its what you called showing in a culture or rather re emphasising a culture Its an important film and no doubt one of the most important ones to have come in the last 20 years Not many films threatened to change the rules of the game as this film did In terms of writing its non-linear now non-linear in the real sense it does not have a proper line of scenes or proper interpretation either but they are connected by characters This film has some iconic scenes which you will never forget Like that adrenalin shot scene to Mia Uma Thurman or reciting Bibles Eziekel 25:17 by Jules Samuel Jackson Though its nearly 2 and hours its not long and seems short as they are many questions unanswered So is Vincent dead or not What is there in that briefcase to Marseilles And these are left unanswered With just 7 scenes you make a 2 and half hour movie that redefines in its own way the perspective of the audience So I am amazed more than anything even as I watch it for nearly 10th time and the surprise keeps coming each time I see this There is something that always works in PULP FICTION But what makes this film work is its writing Its writing like madness there is no proper thing called this is it It can be referred to anything and you may be right The righteous man and the evil man interpretation is just a tiny example that can be taken out for how we can interpret a character If I want to write one favourite scene here its gonna be the whole movie coz I like everything in it Technically I like the cinematography sound design and costumes But above all I liked performances and dialogues Thanks to Quentin who has given us more memorable movies in the last 20 years that are far superior in writing than anyone else But for me this is is my favourite Quentin film and I will stick with this till he out performs himself by writing something much more weird than this A sure 5/5 for one of my favourite films no less everpositive,Its very rare that you find such diversity in a movie now days. I like the story and its concept.A thumping good ode to friendship hope wit wiles and wisdom brimming with crackling characters and topped with the most twister of twists since The Crying Game. The Shawshank Redemption is a powerful and uplifting not to mention Oscar-worthy film. In 2006 it was ranked as the greatest film ever by Empire a film magazine. The year it came out it was nominated for 7 academy awards but did not win a single one because of a movie you may all remember Forrest Gump. Its the no-bull performances that hold back the flood of banalities. Robbins and Freeman connect with the bruised souls of Andy and Red to create something undeniably powerful and moving. Some of The Shawshank Redemption comes across as outrageously improbable. Yet the film keeps pulling you back with its sense of striving humanity slowly turning the tables against evil.positive,its very good film i watched it more than 10 times i like scene of the actress on the wall and the plan to escape i loved the actor personality Morgan was protector to the movie i liked prison manager in acting all actors were perfect i adore adore adore this movie i will watch all movies of this actor thank you a lot but i need to know itpositive,its true linklater took 12 years to develop his family of characters while i was intimidated by the 3 hour run time i have to admit there was not a moment of this film i could have done without this is more than a coming of age story the title family or motherhood would be just as appropriate set in texas the screenplay is natural and reminiscent of plenty of linklaters other work a film that begins with dialog unlike any other linklater films evolves into thoughtful poignant discourse not unlike that from the before series one character in a latenight nacho scene was perhaps a callback to the heady waking life with that said this absolutely is not a mere think piece what makes this film truly fantastic is how accessible the material is given its scope without giving any narrative away ill say that the story itself is absolutely engaging and not without surprises i watched many films at sundance 2014 including comedies and this was the first that had the audience reacting throughout we laughed gasped covered our eyes and i am sure more than a few of us wept the characters are well developed dont be fooled by the title  the spirit of boyhood is alive here but the female characters are thoroughly developed distinct and alive unfortunately though its 2014 this is a rarity in cinema like in waking life and a scanner darkly linklater has again delivered true visual innovation this time however his setup is simple shooting on film linklater replaced rotoscoping with time lapse has a single film ever intentionally traced a character over such a span of time? linklater wisely chose to reveal the main character to us subtly despite this the effect is riveting i am not exaggerating when i say that after i watched this film i sold all of my other tickets to sundance films viewing boyhood for the first time was such a joyful experience that i didnt want to tarnish the experience by any comparison everyone in the eccles theater shared a special few hours together though this only premiered a few days ago i am confident that this will go down as one of the most ambitious and rewarding film projects of our timepositive,Its the screenplay that runs a movie at the end. However prolific may be the story its the screen script that makes or breaks a movie. It applies other way too. The necessity for a movie is just screenplay and nothing else. Quentin Tarantino is the man if you agree the lines i said above. He is the master of characterization and intriguing screenplay. At times we feel fallen out of lengthy dialogues but it just happens to the opposite with Tarantino. You would love to trade anything for a few extra verbose outbursts from Winnfield. The blood the boldness the script the pace the magnificence. this is pure film making. And nothing is compromised. Many wonder if this movie is overrated. I guess its about time we changed. This has all the elements for a blockbuster all time hit it never goes out of style. Its unfortunate it came out in the gold age of American cinema- the 1990s. Nonetheless its the crown of English cinema and will always be.positive,Its the only movie i will remember forever & wont ever refuse to watch once again There are many films which are great but this one is the most: stylish but democraticpositive,its the best sequel in box office in which the joker role is outstanding. Bales Batman is the definitive Batman because we see everything in this character finally on film. Martial arts skills cunning great tactical thinking forensic application technological genius to advance or improve Luscious Foxs inventions/technological breakthroughs intimidating personality and even a little swashbuckling At a running time of almost 3 hours the film never becomes dull which is pretty impressive. The movies action sequences are spectacularly well created and very intense. The dialogue between the characters are intelligent and highly believable. The movies soundtrack is terrific and really exemplifys many of the movies scenes. Extremely well editing and sound use really develop many of the movies action scenes so its not just explosions and visuals like in many other movies. Nolan creates a grand dirty engrossing world and his action sequences just hum. Even if you hate Batman you will love this film. If you dont then something beez wrongz with youz Stunning in every aspect and exceeds all hype and expectation... Cant wait to watch it again or for the Blu-Raypositive,Its the best movie Ive ever seenPulp Fiction made my believe to the chance strongerIt really existsI mean luckThe screenplay is wonderfuldialogs are interesting and the characters are understandableTarantinos made a miracle that will never be forgottenPulp Fictions incredible dialogs and great acts and informal storymade me not to move until the endMrDirector and his movie changed my idea about all the movies I watched after thatTheres a dialog throughout the movie from the Holy Bible:And I will strike down upon thee with the great vengeance and furious anger those who attempt to poison and destroy my brothersAnd you will know my name is the Lord when I lay my vengeance upon theeIt may be about meAt first I suspected him and I wanted to poison and destroy his brothersBut he really did itHe revenged me and after he got finished I really felt damned and crushedI thought Pulp Fiction is not a good one to spend your time and watch itBut it actually cost Im sure it was one of the movies that its beginning was the end of itOr in better languageit was one of the first postmodern moviesTake it easy How can your luck be badThis movie has lots of bad chancesYour bosss wife overdoses and is dying on you and this thing must be unknownWhat will you doYou get out of the toilet and see your enemy is standing right at opposite of you and wants to kill you with your own gunOr youre talking to your friend and hes sitting at the cars behind seatYou look at him during the talk and your pistols in your handsuddenly your gun takes the shot by itselfYou havent shot the legshandsor even the chest Youve shot straight at your friends headAnd when you wake upyouve taken s--t in the car and its full of blood and skull piecesWhat will you do to hide from the copsThere are many things like thisWell its greatEnjoy the acts and screenplaySome dialogs are so funny some are about bad thingsPulp Fiction is a real pulp fictionPULP FICTION IS THE LORD positive,its strange in the last few years whenever ive watched a movie ive been counting the minutes even if im enjoying it has seemed like a task too some extent and i was aware of it boyhood was different at the risk of sounded pretentious it seemed like it was a version of my own memories linklater obviously played on this whether intentional or not it was there he manages to tap into your own life and make this film seem like you are the only person who is ever going to see this movie and its all for you which is am amazing feat im not sure whether ive ever felt this way about a film before i found myself coming to tears at points which werent even sad partsthe whole thing seemed like i was living out a life a strange and abstract version of my own even though the story of my life is a million miles away from masons i cant recommend this film enough the runtime just breezed by and i didnt want it to end i felt like i could have watched masons story for another 12 years simply breathtaking one of the greatest achievements in cinemapositive,Its REALLY good. Every single thing about this movie is cool. Its my number one favourite movie of all time.  Well actually the entire TRILOGY together is my favourite number one movie of all time.  Theres no swearing or nudity. I still dont recommend it for the younger audience because there are some slightly frightening scenes though. But anybody over eleven shouldnt be bothered. I dont recommend it for arachnophobia because it might give them a heart attack. Anyways this movie has an excellent beginning and a wonderful ending. And everything in the middle is great too. BY ALL MEANS RENT IT but make sure you watch the two first movies first.positive,Its not just the best Batman film ever. Its not just the best superhero movie ever. Its more than a money-spinner a franchise a comic-book cash-in. The Dark Knight is a stunning piece of work that deserves every word of praise spoken about it. Thank Warner Bros. for letting Nolan make such a smart thrilling emotionally involving just terrifically well rounded and fully realized entertainment that challenges and elevates notions of what a so-called summer blockbuster can do. The Dark Knight is the best kind of sequel -- one that uses its predecessor as a gateway to explore new facets of its characters and its world.positive,Its my favorite movie not only because Tarantino is a genius but because it have a lot of the greatest actors in it and is a complete masterpiece with violence blood bad words love and everything you want in a movie it is the best Tarantino film for sure. Usually i ask myself Why does anybody make a movie like this It would be the best thing happening.Because the movies we see today are almost all bad. So if you want to watch a great movie if you like action if you like gun shots if you like blood if you like black humor if you like John Travolta Uma Thurman Bruce Willis Tim Roth if you like Samuel L. Jackson and if you like Quentin Tarantino and if you have not watched this movie yet go ahead and watch it.positive,Its hard where to start in such a great film I shall begin at the start in the early scenes of Pulp Fiction two hit-men come to interrogate a mad named Brad although it is not a normal interrogation the language used is very witty and comical this is what makes it my favourite scene What also is comical about this scene is where Brad begins to stutter and summer Jules begins to threaten him waving a gun in his face whilst delivering his famous what phrase Jules is one of the top characters of the film he clearly has more power and intelligence than his sidekick Vincent he also is the main speaker of the film a few times throughout the film he delivers his famous bible quotation before executing his victims But as we progress in the film Jules understands he has been saved by a miracle and he slowly begins to turn his life around John Travolta And SamuelL Jackson were great actors in this film and I think this was the beginning of Jacksons acting career This film was well thought through and the final result was beyond expected Its no wonder that fans spend so much time debating what was in the suitcase as Pulp Fiction leads you on a trail of mystery throughout the whole film you think you will see the contents of the box but you never do it is discussed but the item is never revealed The film has so many astonishing details many of which you wont pick up on the first viewing every time you watch it you pick up a detail that went unrecognised before What is the movies purpose exactly Marsellus is the sort of character who is mentioned over the entire film while being unseen most of the time Marsellus has extreme power over his men without even being present This power is what gets Vincent to act in ways you would not ordinarily expect from a dumb stoned gangster faced with an attractive woman whose husband has gone awaypositive,Its hard to put in words how much I love this movie but here it goes. Pulp Fiction is an absolute masterpiece. A story thats told in non-linear fashion and keeps you guessing what will happen next...even if youve viewed it before. Its so amazing that its nearly flawless Where to begin where to begin. The dialog is interesting yet realistic. Rather than giving us frequent exposition which most filmmakers suffer from Tarantino has found a way for his memorable characters to discuss pointless things that are fascinating to listen to while developing strong character traits. The movies time-line is complex but to summarize it in one sentence it shifts around both forward and backwards between sequences. The direction is sure-handed and Tarantino isnt afraid to hold a shot that flows smoothly with the way its edited. The casting is first-rate this is the movie that helped revive John Travoltas career and made the rest of the actors reputable to the Hollywood system. For those who are concerned about the level of violence its actually not as graphic as it seems. Yes its intense but if you look closely the content of it isnt gratuitous or repulsive. Gene Siskel touched upon this in one of his reviews with Roger Ebert. For example Bruce Willis swipes a man with a samurai sword. The victim is faced away from the camera so you dont see the weapon attack him. Then when Willis stabs the sword into the guys knee its out of frame and we only hear the sound effect & see his reaction. Dont worry Im wrapping this up. If you can surpass the hype and enjoy it for what it is you are going to have a fun two hours. Hope you see it after reading this and enjoy your tasty burgerpositive,Its hard for me to rate a comic book movie 100% the only movies of the genre that deserve this are Superman1978 Spider-Man 2 and The Dark Knight but why Right in the beginning we see the joker robbing a bank with a plan that is for me as good as the final plan of Oceans Eleven and this is only the first scene youll see  in the movie at least 2 equally brilliant plans. The Jokers philosophy is so well made that in sometimes youll forget that he is just a maniac and even think that he is right. Despite the fact that Cristian Bale is not very good playing Bruce Wayne its not that bad hes just there. Now lets talk about the Ledgers performance Of course it deserved the Oscar of course it is awesome but I think that its not only him that made this character great I mean almost every lines that comes out of the jokers mouth is memorable and its not only because Ledgers performance its the excellent script that makes this. Like the critic Pablo Villaca said  See the vulnerable and tragic figure of Batman diving in the shadows of a city desperate for heroic figures is one of the strongest and saddest images that the genre ever produced  this complexity is what makes The Dark Knight different that other good superhero movies like Iron Man. Verdict: With an unusual complexity The Dark Knight puts superhero movies in another degree of film-making and storytelling now go watch this.positive,Its easy to say that LOTR: The Return of the King has the most interaction of Frodo Baggins and Samwise Gamgee of all the LOTR movies. A result of that is you get to really see the great chemistry exhibited by these two actors working together. This is the best of all the LOTR movies in my opinion the way all the stories tie together just works to perfection. Finally you can see Aragorn taking his rightful place as the new king. When Frodo finally gets to Mordor and throws the ring into the pits of it is an extremely well done scene. This is probably the longest single movie not counting the Godfather movies Ive ever seen but it entertains from start to finish.positive,its easy to create an action movie based on big guns big men screaming and big name actors not this movie this movie had a style all of its own it was fresh fun and exhilarating something that this movie does differently than other action films is actually use the camera in its advantage instead of having the camera be something to put on a tripod while waiting for the special effects to happen the camera is used to portray fluid motion you can see every punch gunshot and stab easily and the camera compliments them perfectly if i were to complain about something it would be the characters i feel that the characters werent anything special and they all seemed to be the same person played by a different actor however that doesnt necessarily matter for what they lack in characters they succeed in a surprisingly interesting story the antagonist wasnt the runofthemill mad man who wants to take over the world the antagonist had solid reasons for what hes doing and the film explains it fairly well essentially this was a very fun movie and i highly suggest it if youre in the mood for a brand new type of action moviepositive,Its been 5 years since The Dark Knight was shown into theaters. I was 9 when i watched it and it was good. I kinda appreciated it when I returned on becoming a DC fan back in 2011 when The New 52 came yes i am a new 52 non-hater. The movie is so good that I kept on watching it over and over again. A total reinvention of Batman. It received a heck lot of awards and nominated for so many times. First superhero film to reach 1B worldwide and it is not. The Avengers Heath Ledger did an amazing job as The Joker. Christian Bale once again took over the role and nailed it again. It is better than The Dark Knight Rises which happened to be a not so good work for Nolan. Nolan wasnt planning for a third film but it happened. This led to a lot of mistakes and flaws. The Dark Knight had lots of interesting scenes and intense action. I just hope we can study the movie for my Literature class. Scene by scene we can discuss. Ha ha. It had good music good tone and EPIC directing. It went on into a good direction Rises Not so much. I loved the movie and better than Man of Steel. It didnt waste your 2 hours in which in MOS did. Even though i loved the movie.......i like how each character Bruce Alfred Lucius Joker Harvey Gordon did a great job. Two-Face had an amazing reinvention too. Better than the Tommy. Lee-Jones Two-Face in Batman Forever. The Dark Knight was an unexpected movie. It did amazing great after. Batman begins was released in 2005 and three years later you have the perfect superhero movie sequel. RIP to Heath Ledger. Won best supporting actor in the Oscars....Died with a great movie and one of the best movies in Hollywood history and it will always be remembered. Now that Ben Affleck will take over I expect good acting skills and how he acts as both Batman and Bruce Wayne... Thanks for readingpositive,Its an exciting movie I didnt get bored in this 2.5 hours Great There are several reasons attracting me to watch this movie. I think the first one is that movie was actually filmed in HK. When I first heard this news I felt quite excited about it and so wished I could see the real batman on the top of IFC or central plaza.. Of course I didnt come to see him. Its actually amazing that seeing Hong Kong in that famous Hollywood movie Hong Kong is very beautiful of course Its sweet to hear some Cantonese as well The second reason was Heath Ledger. I was very interested in seeing how this character made him that stressful Did he die for taking too much drugs which could relieve his stress Or he was just a drugs abuser I dont know but I am sure its very pity for a young actor like him died so early He acted actually quite good in the movie his facial and body expressions were too great as well as the way he speaking The third reason was Edison Chan. How did his sex scandal affect his character He was appeared in the movie within 5 seconds and spoke 1 sentence. I had no idea what he supposed to act in this film but I couldnt see his character is necessary in that movie. In fact another unknown Chinese guy Mr Lau was an important character. I like that scene most when the Joker planted explosives on two ferries of evacuees and gave the passengers on board the chance to destroy the opposing vessel one full of prison convicts and another with civilians in order to save their own lives. When the civilians first heard that some of them had already suggested the cops to push the button and let all prisoner die. To be fair the cop decided to distribute everyone a piece of paper and let all people to have a vote for saving themselves or killing others. Surprisingly there were still quite a lot of people voting to not kill the prisoners. I think its a very hard decision A man stood up and said the criminals were deserved to die and they were sinless. Nobody wanted to take the action to kill the people in other boat that man thought he could do so he stood up and pick up the controller and eventually put it down and returned to his seat. On the other hand the boat with prison convicts were silent they were humbled as they realized they had committed different types of crime. At the very last minute a big man stood out and told the cop that I know you dont want to die you can tell everyone I attack you and steal your controller and he got the controller and threw it into sea. What a brave man I think this guy is much better than those civilians. At last both vessels occupants decide they would rather not sacrifice the lives of the passengers in the other vessel for their own. Eventually nobody killed as the joker didnt put the timer on its just a trick that he wanted to test how selfish people were in the very hard moment Its great that people won On the other hand even a very good men can fall like Harvey Dent the so called white knight of the city corrupted as her girlfriend was killed. Good story that let me to think more about the meaning of scarify never think how important you are. Dont be that over-confident and arrogant Always be humble like the sinner instead of heropositive,Its an action movie Starring Christian Bale who to me is the best Batman ever.In the movie Batman tries to save Gotham City from villains along his servant Alfred he manages that with his technology and martial training. Bruce Wayne a billionaire uses his technology of building weapons from Wayne Enterprises in the purposes of good.Fox Morgan Freeman builds the weapons and the car of Batman. After Joker exits the picture of villains in Gotham i looks like its time for Batman to have another enemy so the producers introduce Bane Tom Hardy a very powerful enemy who always wears a mask because of an awful accident.It has an amazing cast with Marion Cotillard Anne Hathaway Joseph Gordon Lewitt and others. Christian Bale represents very well the epitome of a billionaire at day superhero at night.  you feel as if you could reach out and touch the prison walls. And Darabont is an accomplished button pusher. He coaches the actors so that you always know exactly who to root for and against. When it comes to a character like the warden Bob Gunton all Bible- thumping righteousness the movie has no compunction about turning up the hissability factor. He starts out mean then turns meaner then meaner still. When Andy blasts Mozarts The Marriage of Figaro over loudspeakers to the prison work field it becomes a full-scale opera-soothes-the-savage-breast number with the prisoners standing open-mouthed at the sublime sounds. The scene is meant to fire our righteous liberal hearts. It helps of course that most of the prisoners dont actually behave like criminals. They never say a word about their pasts-even Andy remains a downtrodden cipher-and this lends the proceedings a hollow generic feel as if Darabont had constructed a blueprint out of old prison melodramas. A movie like The Shawshank Redemption with its brazenly mechanical plotting and its wish-fulfillment finale requires a lead actor who can carry us on the wings of his good spirits. Tim Robbins is crafty and likable when Andy is hoodwinking the guards and he makes you feel the characters mute anguish. Yet in shouldering what is essentially a laconic- good-guy neo-Gary Cooper role Robbins never quite makes emotional contact with the audience. His face foggy and placid suggests an overgrown babys  theres something naggingly unformed about him. Morgan Freeman on the other hand with his delicate smolder his eyes that seem to peer directly into everyones soul makes Red feel genuine lived-in. Speaking of the prison walls he says First you hate em. Then you get used to em. After long enough you get so you depend on em. Thats institutionalized. With his gift for rapt pauses for caressing just the right syllable Freeman can make a speech like that sound like one of the philosophical nuggets of the ages. Then again isnt it time Morgan Freeman stopped playing the soulful sidekick While were on the subject of prison walls an actor as great as he is shouldnt get too used to movies like this one. B-positive,its amazing how some people think this movie is so awesome it has everything you need you want a love story its there you want revenge its got you covered they took an old classic and gave it a nice twist they brought the story to life and gave it flare the movie is not dull at all seeing how stephans love turns to hate was great how they showed him become the monster was classic angelina jolie acting was on point she played the part of the scorned fairy so well you emphasized with her story i wanted her to get revenge against stephan the girl who played snow white fit the ideal character her smile and demeanor showed caring and wonder you believed the fairy land was real i have nothing negative to say about this movie its a nice take on an old storypositive,its always refreshing to see the backstory of how evil develops in past days it was too easy to show the simplistic snidely whiplash versions of villains twirling their handlebar mustaches its even better when the villains redeems themselves and the cherry on top is when a 53 old moviegoer can enjoy the same film among a theatre full of children albeit the crying babies note to parents dont rule out giving your bundles of joy just a very tiny bit of nighttime tylenol about an hour before the movie starts theyre too young to remember being there anyway and everyone else doesnt have to hear their screeching thanks in the tradition of those writers who helped bring to the screen the latest versions of darth vader dr baltar and mila kuniss witch theodora theyve shown very effectively the complicated layers of how evil develops from otherwise good souls such is the case in this departure from the original sleeping beauty reimagining angelinas winged maleficent starts as a loving but aggressive protector of her home but like two of the above mentioned characters betrayal and heartbreak provide the catalyst of transformation from peace and love to revenge and hate then to vindicate the audience from having any misplaced empathy is the redemption the catalyst for this is the love between maleficent and aurora played by elle fanning who adopts her as her fairy god mother this is quite a departure from the animated version i saw some 43 years ago which was 12 years after its 1959 release and angelinas version of maleficent is equally as different from eleanor audleys voiced version not to disparage the original i like this story retold much better i can remember not being that impressed at 10 as i am by this latest version other moral lessons such as the effects of greed ambition fear etc are well taught without the unnecessarily preachy exposition to me this makes a film experience that can be enjoyed by children and adults alike this is one the better efforts put forth by disney lets hope the tradition continues with the upcoming star wars features too bad walt didnt live to see cgi and the latest talent lastly im hearing these rumors about this movie being angelinas big comeback? hmm i never knew she was gone then im always rewatching gia and tomb raider in between her projectspositive,Its a usual misconception when people say that dark knight is overrated just because of an amazing performance by heath ledger as the joker. The jokers acting which by the way is one of the best acting you will ever find is just an icing over the cake. From the start the movie is fast paced which is necessary for a thriller movie which makes you lean forward with your chin on your palms elbows on your thighs and mouth wide open throughout the movie. The movie is one of its kind because you experience the best dialogues memorable performances great direction and an amazing message that goes through your heart. I have already mentioned about the performances which is topped by heath ledger as the joker but the dialogues cannot be appreciated unless you see the movie itself but the movie has nerve-chilling dialogues that you cannot miss. The message on the other hand is something really extra ordinary. something that you wouldnt expect from a superhero movie. At the end of the movie batman takes the responsibility of killing a certain number of cops. Or in simple words he portrays himself as a villain in the eyes of people. What kind of a dumbstruck superhero would do such a thing Well only batman can. For the sake of people retaining their faith in good which was ignited in them by Harvey Dent batman risks his image by turning into an apparent villain. he believes that at the end of the day these citizens will be the heroes of themselves. He believes that some day Gotham city will no longer need batman to bring justice. He wants them to be independent on batman. Many people never like it in the first go. I myself never did. But watch it once more to understand why everything happens because the movie is directed in a very logical and planned way. Everything in the movie has a reason for its occurrence. So those who havent seen the movie yet - YOU CANNOT MISS THIS MOVIE those who didnt like it for the first time - WATCH IT AGAIN. And for those who loved it id still say - WATCH IT AGAIN.positive,its a masterpiece the best batman movie ever .. awesome screenplay by Nolan brothers and all the other writers .. beautiful direction by Nolan .. incredible acting performances by all the cast Cristian BaleMorgan freemanGary oldmanAaron Eckhartand all the others did a fantastic job but according to me heath ledgers joker overshadowed all the performances ...he was exceptional . n surpassed jack Nicholsons joker in all aspects ..plot was good ..action scenes were awesome .. dialouges were super awesome ....camerawork was beautiful ..its the movie u ll never forget .. its a thrilling experience ..u cant expect more from a batman movie ...its a must watch a true eye candy positive,its 400 in the morning and i just saw that almost three hours long movie but yet there was not a single moment of sleepy like it would come with other movies that is the greatest story ever made the true life so much ordinary things that it becomes noordinary film whit lots of energy enthusiasm i got that feeling like falling in love or being on the most beautiful place you ever seen it forces you to think a lot                           i could probably wrote much more but than no one would start to read  ps sorry for my englishpositive,it well deserved the 11 Oscars it is brilliant These movies will never be forgotten.

I wont bother with the story because it is one of the most famous of all time and pretty simple so i will just get to the movie. Revolutionary visual effects Cast - perfect. Elijah Wood is perfect as Frodo Ian McKellen as Gandalf best casting choice ever Viggo Mortensen who would have though everyone else is also great even Christopher Lee who I dont think has ever not played a villain but that is just because he is so good at it And of course who can forget Cate Blamchett who is barely on screen but all the same is excellent. Dialogue excellent what more can I say if you havent seen this movie you have not been born yet This is one of the best series created. Fantasy 1. Lord of the Rings 2. Chronicles of Narnia & Harry Potter 3. Cant think of one worth putting up there have been plenty of dudspositive,It was the film that never seemed to have a break cut out for it. Adapted from a Steven King short story usually a sure sign of success yet a disappointment at the box office. Nominated for seven Oscars yet emerging with no wins. But hope sprung eternal and as life began to imitate art like its central characters the film The Shawshank Redemption overcame such initial adversity to become one of the most revered and cherished films of all time. Director/screenwriter Frank Darabont working from Steven Kings short story Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption brings the tale to life in a superbly powerful and emotionally flooring fashion. Darabonts script executes the incredibly difficult task of speaking directly to the human spirit with its tale of passion and dedication overcoming captivity and adversity. Few modern films are bold enough to tackle such shamelessly inspirational themes as Shawshanks without coming across as painfully clich’©d but Darabonts airtight script chock full of timeless lines and steady careful directing are enough to raise the film above such concerns instead marking a film of which the emotional magnitude is seldom paralleled. From Roger Deakins sweeping operatic cinematography to Thomas Newmans truly beautiful and inspiring musical  to the dank gritty realism of Shawshank prison itself the films consistent quality on all fronts is truly stunning. It is easy to see a story such as this easily falling flat with an inferior cast taking on the material but Darabonts incredibly gifted and memorable cast is truly up to the challenge taking a wonderful story and making it truly timeless. Tim Robbins truly brings unconventional convict Andy Dufresne to life never without a passionate twinkle in his eye even in his most beaten down and hopeless of scenes. Rather than typical leading man grandstanding Robbins is wise enough to remain subtle and detached throughout making the role all the more mysterious and endearing as a result. The inspired casting of Morgan Freeman as fellow inmate Red resulted not only in a series of sumptuous voiceovers by one of the most melodious voices in Hollywood but also in a genuinely heartwarming supporting character with Freeman building a career of playing similar wise mentor figures off his performance. The supporting cast being comprised mainly of relative unknowns strengthens the believability of their characters leading the audience to see them as their character and not as the star behind the role. Bob Gunton is chillingly effective as the hate-inspiring prison warden infusing more menace into his reedy voice and deadpan stare than any scenery chewing antagonist could capture. Character actor Clancy Brown also crafts another simple but effective antagonistic role as the captain of the guards. Gil Bellows is a strong presence as a rebellious inmate and James Whitmore is charming and lovable as aged prison librarian Brooks. Overall The Shawshank Redemption is an astonishing accomplishment addressing shamelessly uplifting themes in a fashion which is sentimental but never sappy larger than life but never melodramatic. In many ways the film feels like a throwback to the days of classic cinema where directors strove to make films which made their audiences happy but Darabont easily dodges contemporary scorn by unabashedly and honestly pitching the film towards the human spirit and firmly establishing it as a timeless classic with its impeccable package of flooring technical work screen writing and acting. Far from being a simple prison drama the sheer emotional voyage of The Shawshank Redemption is enough to drain any viewer both crushing their spirits then euphorically raising them in a truly peerless fashion. While Red may declare hope to be a dangerous thing its Darabonts fearless tackling of the tricky subject which really sets Shawshank free. -10/10  beautiful but plain  action-packed but clever  touching but cynical  And oh these characters.. I love the film though i dont count Tarantino a genius or something as you may think not. positive,It was the best film I have ever seen and could watch it over again. It was quite disappointing that Saruman wasnt in there but because of that you had a slightly happier ending. If he had been in there the film would have been 45 minutes longer. Anybody that is still confused should read the book rather than wait a year until the extended version comes out.positive,it was a great moviede palma did a great job all the writers did a great job tooif only mission impossible 2 could have been as good as the first mission impossible the story line in the first one was great along with the actingpositive,It was a great movie. I would love to play a part in it I am a huge fan of all of the Lord of the rings. I love how each one leaves you wanting more. You cant stop at just one. You must keep going... Its infectious Its got plenty of mysterylovefriendshipbattlesmagic Its really just a great set. Good verses evil as most movies have but SO much moreI am a die hard fan of Lord of the rings ALL of them and that is including the new Hobbit is awesome I can not wait to see the next one I will be at the theater as soon as it comes out Everything i imagined as a small girl comes to life in these movies. Its such a beautiful fantasyadventure movie for every child and adult who has an imagination.positive,It was a day like any other. Wake up early morning eat school jack off etc. etc. etc. I would come back home from school shower eat then try and find ways to waste time. I would flip through channels like a magazine or probably treat myself to a snack. The thing that made this day special was that I was going to watch IMO the greatest movie of all time. Before watching this movie my taste was.... Generic to say the least. My favorite movie was The A-Team. My taste was horrible. I recently watched Inception so I was slowly being... Devoured or welcomed whichever way you see it into the movie world. After watching THIS piece of art however I was just amazed. The acting was amazing. The directing was pitch perfect. And the script... Oh jumping Jesus on a pogo stick the script left me speechless. I envy those movie watchers who get to watch this for the first time. Anyways fast forward a couple of months later i already watchedpositive,it took me a while before i saw this movie i read the plot and saw a trailer but it didnt quite managed to catch my attention i had the idea that it would be more of a kids movie one reason was rocket the raccoon yesterday i finally watched it and boy was i wrong the guardians of the galaxy is a random band of rascals made up of an assassin a raider two bounty hunters kind of and a huge blue guy hungry for vengeance for different reasons they find them selfs fighting an evil set on destruction on epic scale that is threatening any planets in the galaxy now you think thats really nothing new and youre right it isnt but take my advice ad see it if you have any interest in scifi action or comedy you will find all three the performance is good at worst and excellent at best the whole range from cgi and environments are perfect right down to small details and corny things like a precious walkman goolge it   see it just dopositive,It starts out with two talking about job it continues with two people talking about job actually all this movie shows are two people doing their job But these are different people throughout the film Tim Roth and Amanda Plummer give a good reminiscent view of True Romance while John Travolta and cool coiffured Samuel L Jackson simply do a job - it is just that their job is killing people Their killing scene is one of the most nerve wrecking imaginable especially for the victims due to Jacksons quite eccentric behavior Bruce Willis and Ving Rhames turn from partners in betrayal to enemies to partners in revenge in an unheard of plot twisting sequence The flic actually looks more difficult than it is by far We have three stories woven into one Apart from the pre-credit intro and the subsequent Travolta / Jackson opening stories #2 and#3 are told first and then rounded out by #1 #2 Vincent Vega And Marsellus Wallaces wife shows what could have been - under different circumstances - the beginning of a romance and what turns into pure horror due to mixed-up addictions #3 The Gold Watch shows prize fighter Willis who - more or less - accidentally breaks a deal and thus is not longer safe in town Before he can run away he has to go back to his apartment to pick up his gold watch that his girl-fiend had forgotten After an encounter with Travolta he bumps into Ving Rhames whom he had the deal with After this the movie gets really weird - and good Then in #1 we are shown Travolta and Jackson who kill a few guys who did wrong witness a miracle and see a quite normal business day turned into bulls**t when Travolta loses control of his finger - enter Tarantino and Keitel The movie ends with Plummer and Roth in a different-angle version of the pre-credit sequence What makes this movie really good are the dialogues Plummer / Roth Travolta / Jackson Travolta / Thurman Willis / Rhames Willis / taxi driver Angela Jones Keitel / Tarantino and sequences like the Christopher Walken scene This movie is so good that nobody misses the box fight which could have made a good scene All in all this is a true cinematic masterpiecepositive,It seems that Pulp Fiction is one of the most discussed films on The IMDB and the opinions seem to be split totally 50/50 like with almost every other Tarantino pic out there But whether you like it or not whether you hate it or love or whether your a big QT fan or just hate the guy you have to admit that no film is more 100% sure on becoming a classic later on In fact this great rift between movie-goers about this film is one of the things that will make it a timeless classic whether you like it or not Personally I think this is one of the 5 best pictures ever made both from a totally critical perspective and also from a more personal point of view since I think that Quentin is the best living director/writer in the business So go out and rent the movie and decide for yourself if you arenÎ‚t squeamish youÎ‚ll probably love itpositive,it seems kenneth branagh have been trying to recreate the success of their first 90s anime ripoff dead again  with little or no success for over a decade now sometime even going so far as to credit the original as is the case with the magic flute  no attempt was made to distract from the plagiarism but here they decided to pull out the stops and make their films as wild as possible some may defend cinderella 2015 as some have defended the hunger games mockingjay  part 1 but trust me this is worse than the hunger games mockingjay  part 1 i dont know where to begin with the awfulness of this film its so corny minddumbingly so all of the dialogue is ridiculous wow how low do you have to be? what kind of sociopathic creature stoops that low to wantonly and ignorantly destroy beauty and by this i mean kenneth branagh who? simple jr and his boyfreind thats whopositive,It may be over 10 years old now but Return Of The King definitely hasnt lost any of its shine. After a lucky victory at Helms Deep Aragorn Legolas Gimli and there new friends from Rohan set out to Isengard to rescue Merry and Pippin. We also see Sam and Frodo bravely continuing there journey to Mt Doom with the aid of Gollum. The acting throughout this film is brilliant with more amazing performances from Ian McKellen Gandalf Viggo Mortensen Aragorn and of course Sean Astin Samwise Gamgee. Andy Serkis Gollum also deserves a lot of credit. He did a fantastic job of playing Gollum and really put his heart and soul into creating such a memorable character. And with two major battles this really is the icing on the cake for the Lord Of The Rings series. With stunning backdrops impressive effects and a brilliant ensemble cast this is a must see film for any fantasy fan. It also has the perfect balance of action fantasy romance and fighting. Looking back its no wonder this film won 11 Oscars and Peter Jackson deserves all the praise he gets for adapting Tolkiens wonderful stories onto the big screen. Whether you watch the original or the extended edition this film will NOT disappoint you.positive,it looks as though maleficent is another of those movies that sits under the disney banner yet is far from a childrens only movie theres death destruction duplicity and derring do in equal measure yes despite the fact that there are fairies nymphs and other mythical creatures that might inhabit the usual childrens story this would probably sit more comfortably with the original grimm stories than disneys animated version from 1959 the fact is though after the pirates of the caribbean series we are fast becoming used to a more adult story line in disneys live action movies and in my opinion theyre all the better for it maleficent appears to follow the same course as sleeping beauty but is far less predictable and has a large number of twists and turns seeing the story from a refreshing viewpoint that of the socalled wicked witch  who this time isnt a witch at all the stereotypes that usually accompany disney films with this kind of story premise are still there but this time are somehow more real maleficent presents us with a very believable plot  despite and including the fairies  and strong characters with very real motivation the approach used in this movie was enough to keep us glued to the screen from beginning to end with jolie in brilliant form in the lead role the story was riveting keeping us guessing right up until the endpositive,It is year 2009 and yet this movie is still the best movie I have ever seen. It truly and rightfully deserves to be the best movie of all times. Story telling acting directing anything that you can imagine about a movie is so perfectly done. I believe everyone will have his own message from the movie but if you want to see a movie that tells how important the role of hope in our life is you are at the correct address. The atmosphere in the prison the way people feel and the way all these things were put together in a two hours moviepositive,it is the most great film in the history of American cinema. Robbins and freeman are fantastic. it implants hope in our soul. friendship relation between the Robbins and freeman in the film is very nice. i know that movie is the first in the IMDb schedule  and its really worth it. When I watch any movie I always return to your appreciation of it and relied upon but in this film Ive seen just so I said it deserved to be the best and when I returned to the evaluation have really found is also.But I do not know why did not achieve high income while movie display but perhaps it was due to have been introduced in the early nineties of the last century and the film does not usually attracts young researcher substance or sexual violence.positive,It is the best Superhero film ever made. The Batman proved that he is more than a hero The Dark Knight n Heath Ledger The Joker commendable VillainI think the best villain ever complete portray of Lucifer a great n best child of Lucifer. The all praise goes to the whole team of the film n especially to the Christopher Nolan. The script is extraordinary the screenplay is unbelievable classic and Cinematography that is basis of the featured filmsis truly exceptional and remarkable. I think the Joker more ruled than the Dark Knight and its seemed the serious and grave Tom and Jerry storyin which the jocular criminal Joker is Tom and the Classic Hero is Batman:The Dark Knight and at the end the Good won. loved it most....  I felt as if Ive gone through the struggles that he went through as well. You could see how time is irrelevant in prison  you feel minutes go by when its actually days weeks months and years. And then youll feel disappointed at all those years where you could have done something different in the world outside. The film is also an eye-opener. You open your eyes to what its like in prison  although the prison in the movie seems more ideal than real life prisons. You get a glimpse of brutality and rape inside prison. You get to see how some prisoners become institutionalized and never seem to want to leave anymore. There is also a depiction of how rampant corruption is and its sad to think that those involved are the ones who are supposed to be protecting and abiding by the law. The cast is great. I couldnt ask more from Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman. Even the other prisoners are good too. Overall I think that the main point of this movie is never to lose hope  that hope is always a good thing. This movie is as equally good as Forrest Gump and Pulp Fiction movies that were made in the same year as this but I cant understand why only these two movies got most of the attention. All in all this movie certainly is the kind of movie to watch before you die. positive,It is really amazing movie i have ever seen in my lifetime. The cast and the story of the movie are really successful. Andy is a passionate character and he is convicted of murdering his wife and her lover despite his claims of innocence. It is so touching to spend almost two decades in the prison. Old-fashioned prisons in the 90s are full of bad guy who dont expect anything from the life. And  they dont think how we escape here. Howeverpositive,It is one of the most important movies of the 1990s if not ever because it put Quentin Tarantino on the map as one of the directors to look out for Pulp Fiction stars Tim Roth Amanda Plummer John Travolta Samuel L Jackson Bruce Willis Ving Rhames Uma Thurman Christopher Walken Harvey Keitel and many many more and was written and directed by Quentin Tarantino Why is Pulp Fiction considered a masterpiece Because it has really well written dialog Š—– the driving force behind this movie is the dialog despite all the mob and gangster elements this movie has If you love superbly written dialog in movies you will probably like Pulp Fiction From the get going Pulp Fiction you know exactly what movie you are in for Š—– great dialog a lot of racial slurs and the movie being obscurely original Instead of running in chronological order from start to finish the movies chapters are all mixed up in a really stylish way Half of the fun you will have with this movie is piecing the movie together after the first time you watch it Moreover the characters are awesome as well Š—– Samuel L Jackson and John Travolta make this movie however they are not the only ones who make the movie great Another thing that works for Pulp Fiction is the soundtrack After you watch Pulp Fiction you will have all these songs in your head that will make you buy the soundtrack CD because they are all so catchy The songs are also very well edited into the scenes in this movie A dialog based movie That should be extremely boring but in this case it is not Š—– great acting a great premise great dialog it even proves that violence can indeed be funnypositive,it is one of the best movies ive watched as a great admirer of angelina jolie i confess i was watching the movie just because of her but i liked everything the story we all already know totally changed its like if who told the story had never thought like the wicked witchwicked witch who no longer deserves to be called in this way the way what the film shows that true love neednt be between a man and a woman maleficent was the mother that aurora had not even after all the disappointments maleficent shows his good side that had never died was just hiddenno matter what you think about fairy tales you need to watch this film because you will not see anything like this for a long timepositive,It is great how They portrait the joker with his jokes and smiling. The whole entire movie is rally good drama. Every cut-scenes is carefully taken and well prepared and I think is really awesome. The fighting is great to even thought you dont see so much fighting in this film because I have always think of the batman is more like a cool detective dress up as a bat that uses really cool toys. I dont know exactly if this film follows any comic book because I havent read any of them but I like how they introduce the joker and two face. The its film based more in a way of curing the city of the criminal activity and gangs which I think is great.positive,It is a movie made by a passionate film maker whose passion could be sensed in every set pieces and story elements .I happened to be very fortunate to get to watch it on its opening day 18 july 2008.And whatever ill assumption I made before entering the theater was completely vanished and i was speechless from its glittering imax footage action chase sequences to human emotions  everything is top notch I hardly believe ever there could be any film made with such perfection. This is not an ordinary movie which is made from computer graphics footage but believe me the stunts are for real and performed under strict guidance and a lot of practice and a lot of hard work . Talking about the story  you could sense minute details of human emotions and it feels so refreshing that you would definitely be not forgetting at all .It seems pretty rare for some blockbuster movie to offer that thing. 10 on 10 from me worth more than 100 time watchpositive,It is a masterpiece Quentin Tarantino arrives to Immortality A different film language that had never seen That said Tarantinos twist on the pulp genre is also damn near a work of art At 31 he shows a disdain for flashy style and lofty pretension His passion is for storytelling that allows the most outrageous characters to reveal their feelings in long takes and torrents of words poetic and profane Pulp Fiction proves that Tarantino is the ideal director for preserving the verbal rhythm and wicked playfulness of his scripts He revels in pop culture especially that of the 70s and hes no snobpositive,It is a great movie because you can see it in two ways: as a normal spectator enjoying the scenes the story and the sketches and as a really accurate spectator trying to keep in mind all the little details understanding all the connections between facts words and characters If you watch it this way at the end of the movie when you realize the correct time order of the scenes you notice that you missed so many details and you want to start the movie again watching it with another point of view It does not matter how many times you watch the entire film there are always new details and links you may discover The characters are great with a good balance between action fun serious moments and drama A really must see film that defines a cinematographic stylepositive,it is a great movie amazing this movie is one cool movie i never saw anything like this before you will like it a lot i like this movie more than any movie this movie is the best PG13 i ever saw you have never seen a movie this good before i think this maybe one of the best PG13 movie in the whole world i can not wait till the dark knight rises in IMAX now that will be good this movie is a masterpiece it is amazing i never saw a movie this good before it is the best PG13 movie in the whole world this movie is a knockout it hits a home run it is a movie that you will like a lot it is one of the best best PG13 movies i ever saw i think this is the best PG13 movie PG13 movies i like this movie more than any PG13 movie i ever saw make this the number 1 PG13 movie in the whole world this movie is one awesome movie make this movie number 1 of the best PG13 movies i like this PG13 moviespositive,It is 2014 and I still dont get tired of seeing this movie. And by this movie Iam not referring to the third part but all of them. It is a movie that has everything youd like to be in a movie: it is the movie with more body count 836 only in this part it has action adventure and even you could see romance between some characters.It is impossible to get bored with this film it is full of epic quotes epic scenes and epic wars all this complemented with a good story. All in all this movie deserves a 10 and in my humble opinion it is the best movie you can see ever. Many years will have to pass to see a movie better than this.positive,It honestly does little to his stature by mentioning that author J.R.R. Tolkien was a genius but its as true as anything I know. His words told a story but its what they leave behind with the reader that made all the difference. Something deep touched director Peter Jacksons heart when he first read it and I know this because I felt it too when I read it and again the same feeling when I saw the movies. Say what you will about the integrity of events or characters in this adaptation but theres no denying the passion and solidarity to Tolkiens work. `The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King is the point where all lines characters story events from past to present draw together and complete the picture so wide in scale so epic in its execution that it takes more than just a few minutes to truly appreciate the complexity of this giant film. I have seen nothing like it before in my life and remain in awe of the gift of success that came at such an enormous risk. Much that was once doubted or criticized has been washed away in a sweet tide of victory from the filmmakers. But aside from all the obvious technical and narrative achievement of each film the most amazing feat that Jackson and company was able to accomplish was bringing these three continuing films together seamlessly as one free flowing tale. As the camera lens widens with epic visuals of massive armies and battle scenes the story simultaneously narrows in on the relationships and character struggles. On one hand its about the peoples of Middle-earth and on the other its about the individual characters whose fate is entwined into these horrific circumstances. Neither one overshadows the other as Jackson manages to juggle everything with such care and expert deliverance. Much of the films success is due to the intricate development of so many wonderful characters that remain at the foreground of Jacksons film versions. Superb casting has seen this become the most beloved element in the films something you remember strongly toward the end when we see them saying goodbye there is a genuine feeling of loss and accomplishment as we conclude this journey together. Peter Jackson has worked hard its plain to see and the rewards are more than one could wish for. What he has done with this legendary tale is go far beyond just making three movies. He has ushered in a new era in film with outstanding quality and approach ever vigilant of the viewers. These films are for the fans by the fans and he has done all this without taking his eye off the ball as a filmmaker. It is over now but the films are instant classics that will live on through the test of time. I am thankful for the chance to see these movies in my time and will be forever grateful for Peter Jackson and his good heart. Here at the end of it all I look back spellbound. `The Return of the King is an amazing conclusion not only to the hard long journey but also to the captivating world of Middle-earth. So much has gone into these films and so much has come out of them to the lives of the people around it. I am touched by Peter Jackson and the work from his amazing visionaries who knew above all else that what they had was something special to tell. Every frame is littered with detail and splendor. Not a moment is lost to carelessness or brevity. Its loving and frightening. It will take you on the trip of your life into golden fields and dark tunnels. Overall it just tells a fantastic story. Its a story that has lived on for generations and will continue to inspire and entertain. We will never see the likes of it again as it respectably slips into history as the great trilogy that ruled them all. For the Quest is achieved and now all is over. I am glad to have been there too.  - 5 out of 5positive,It faithfully showed all the best things from the books and brought middle earth to our TV and cinema screens which is awesome and legendary all in all one of the best movies iwe ever watched and i strongly recommend for everyone to see itthe remorse will not be shown i guaranty you that.The movie can surely be watched by non fantasy fans because its beautifully shot effects and the music were perfectly done and mixed...i just have one thing that bugs me:Peter should show the audience extended edition because it shows what happened to sarumanand that is a big minus to all book lovers.Aside from that everything else was more than satisfying for me and for most people...positive,It couldnt be another better ending for this wonderful trilogy. All the work is fantastic but this third part of this story couldnt be better. Congratulations to all the team. I had read the trilogys book before watching the film and I thought in a epic history that is how it has been I was not wrong. So the only more thing I can say is if there is someone that has not seen this film yet dont wait more. Also I recommend the new trilogy based in the world of J.R.R. Tolkien called The Hobbit Its awesome. Perhaps one of the most important point to have made this film the best option it has been the choice of the environment. Simply amazing.positive,It almost goes without saying that Pulp Fiction was one of the most influential and iconic films of the 90s In all honesty it probably was the very top film in this regard I can still remember seeing it for the first time and being amazed I had loved Quentin Tarantinos earlier Reservoir Dogs but thought he had upped the ante even higher with this movie Seeing it again recently I have to say it remains an incredibly well made and entertaining bit of cinema And even though I have enjoyed all of Tarantinos films since there is no doubt in my mind that his three 90s crime films tower above all of his post millennium filmography In those ones he seemed to integrate his obsession with pop cultural references into strong stories as opposed to nowadays where his movie references have become so blatant and full on that they have become an actual handicap of sorts Pulp Fiction is the movie where he best showcases his style in a movie that is consistently brilliant from start to finish Its essentially three stories entwined All on the face of it standard crime cinema tales where something goes wrong but Tarantino focuses on unusual details that make them completely original The chief aspect that differentiates them from others is his brilliant dialogue that is never afraid to go on non-plot related diversions in ways that utterly humanises the thuggish bad guys that populate his film The script is full of pop cultural references inventive profanity witticisms and even many moments of wisdom Tarantinos primary gift and the one he will be remembered for is his gift for dialogue You get the impression that actors are instructed to deliver their lines word-for-word  this isnt a film that feels improvised in any way On some very odd occasions this can result in some lines feeling a little forced but the pay-off is massive as the script is quite simply genius in many ways This great writing has created some excellent iconic characters It doesnt do any harm either that the acting is top level throughout Well with the exception of Tarantinos cameo that is Š—– hes pretty terrible and should really never act But otherwise its quality all the way with standout turns from Samuel L Jackson John Travolta Bruce Willis Harvey Keitel Christopher Walken and Uma Thurman Jackson probably steals the show with the character Jules but Travolta is very impressive and convincing as Vincent Vega Š—– you really believe he is a pretty nasty bit of work under the charm Thurman and Willis play typical film-noir characters namely the femme fatale and the boxer who throws the fight Š—– both are excellent While Keitel and Walken have cameo roles with the former as the very memorable Mr Wolf while the latter is in an extremely funny role as an ex-soldier who wore a watch up his butt So whats it all about Well the title says it all really because this is an unashamed bit of pulp fiction but a wonderfully original presentation of it Its influence is other movies such as Italian poliziotteschi and American film noir with a huge post-modernist make-over Films specifically referenced include The Italian Connection a black and white gangster hit men are sent to sort a situation out and Kiss Me Deadly a plot revolves around a suitcase that when opened has a mysterious glow It is essentially a crime-comedy with a real focus on humour This means that some of the strong violence is played simultaneously realistically but also for comic effect While the staggered time-line is constructed for maximum impact It is for example a pretty rare thing for a film to kill off a character Vincent and then go back in time a little to watch his exploits in another escapade We know he is doomed but cant help but completely forget this fact Its one of many reasons that this film stands out One of the very best of the 90s and Tarantinos masterpiece positive,Is there anybody out there that was more excited about this movie than I was MaybeŠ—_ but most probably not. Ive been looking forward to another Batman movie since the credits rolled on Batman Begins back in 2005. Batman is a movie that needs no synopsis even for non-fans. But in case you are totally clueless all you need to know is that Batman is a guy that dresses up in a bat costume and fights crime in Gotham city. The Dark Knight continues where Batman Begins left off. Christian Bale reprises his role as Barman from the last movie and this time he has two new villains: The Joker played by Heath Ledger and Two-Face/Harvey Dent played by Aaron Eckhart. This is no doubt the most hyped movie of the year especially with Heaths sudden death and I must tell you it was up to the hype or very very close to it. Theres a buzz for an Oscar campaign for Heath and Ill tell you right now that he was absolutely amazing and deserves an Oscar or at least a nomination. If Warner Brothers didnt tell us Heath was playing The Joker I swear not many people would have guessed it was him. I know I wouldnt have. So is this a good movie or just a good-Joker-used-to-promote-an-average movie Good question. But an even better question is did you watch Batman Begins Did you enjoy it If you watch this movie youll never want to watch Batman Begins again because The Dark Knight will make it look like the worst movie youve ever seen. I promise you. Everyone is talking about The Joker but Harvey Dent/Two face is equally as good. His make- up as Two Face will blow you away and his acting is nothing less than amazing. Everyone else reprised their role from the last moviepositive,Is The Dark Knight Best Film ever made For me YES. The Dark Knight is a film thats fantastic on the action front seeds its acrobatics in its own reality and always feels relevant even when its ideas are drowned out by clatter. Its just the best Batman film ever. Its just the best superhero movie ever. Its more than a money-spinner a franchise a comic-book cash-in. The Dark Knight is a stunning piece of work that deserves every word of praise spoken about it.Christopher Nolan is much much smarter than your Every filmmaker.This Film Is More than a comic-book adventure this is a sprawling Epic crime. Anyway Chis Nollan And Batman For Me  Is a Best Picture.positive,Is the best movie of all time. Not only for IMDb users but also for other rewires. This movie has it all. Suspense drama comedy tenderness friendship etc. The photography is also magnificent. The characters are the best actor in Hollywood at that time. An incredible Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins. The story is complete and has an spectacular ending. THe best ending the Hollywood made. This movie must win an Oscar but unfortunately Tom Hanks Forrest Gump was more patriotic at that time and won the best picture Oscar. It is important to you dont miss this movie although you dont like prisons movie. So if you didnt see it please rent it now. You wont regret.positive,interstellar _ my experience love is the only thing that transcends time and space i am not sure whether i am intelligent enough to review this film but as a normal viewer i am going to share my views about the interstellar experience my interstellar experience started even before watching the film itself i spent some time brushing up my knowledge about the theories discussed in the film the advantage of being a physics student made my work easy in fact the movie became much more understandable in the near future our earth becomes more polluted and human beings have to find a new home to survive or at least to stop their species from extinction nasa sends a group of explorers into a newly discovered wormhole to find a habitable land for the humans this is just the basic plot of a wonderful experience this is a christopher nolan film and he wants the viewer to have some basic knowledge of physics to understand the film he is best known for the novelty in themes and the emotional approach he takes the dark knight trilogy director maintains his trademark of elevating the content than the characters nolan literally takes us to the outer space from earth to various planets through the wormhole one would really feel oneself as cooper while watching the film placing some unexpected events in between the writer amazes the viewer especially the climax the final phases of interstellar were mindblowing and thought provoking i was blown away by the ideals nolan placed in the penultimate scenes the concept of fifth dimensional sequences inside

transcends time and space i am not sure whether i am intelligent enough to review this film but as a normal viewer i am going to share my views about the interstellar experience my interstellar experience started even before watching the film itself i spent some time brushing up my knowledge about the theories discussed in the film the advantage of being a physics student made my work easy in fact the movie became much more understandable in the near future our earth becomes more polluted and human beings have to find a new home to survive or at least to stop their species from extinction nasa sends a group of explorers into a newly discovered wormhole to find a habitable land for the humans this is just the basic plot of a wonderful experience this is a christopher nolan film and he wants the viewer to have some basic knowledge of physics to understand the film he is best known for the novelty in themes and the emotional approach he takes the dark knight trilogy director maintains his trademark of elevating the content than the characters nolan literally takes us to the outer space from earth to various planets through the wormhole one would really feel oneself as cooper while watching the film placing some unexpected events in between the writer amazes the viewer especially the climax the final phases of interstellar were mindblowing and thought provoking i was blown away by the ideals nolan placed in the penultimate scenes the concept of fifth dimensional sequences inside the tesseract came out as a surprise those sequences were beyond my

christopher nolan so it not going to be a simple movie its not the overall plot is that the earth is dying so coopermatthew mcconaughey and a team of scientists must go and find another place to live the acting is greatwhat makes it so great is cooper and his daughter every time they were together it was wow the visuals were on another level if you cansee it on the biggest screen possible some people may not like this movie because it talks a lot about science and many other things but you enjoy that you will have a blast with thisoverall interstellar is a must see i think it was nolans

This film is produced for them that grew up nowadays not for child today. What a wonderful cast on both hero and villain that gives us very intricate and attractive characters which all of them are both shed partially obviously traits and also hid some shade in shadow. Great story telling and very nice concept that play with heros dilemma. Provoke on ethical concept even on those folk on film and us in front of the screen.

However I will express the positive effect it can have on the viewer if they let it. The acting is uncommonly magnificent. Morgan Freeman delivers the greatest performance of his brilliant career as the seasoned life-serving prisoner Ellis Boyd Red Redding Tim Robbins holds his own against Freeman as Andy the central character James Whitmores portrayal of the institutionalized Brooks provides the backbone of the story Bob Gunton is wonderful as the corrupt Warden Norton and Clancy Browns commanding performance as Captain Hadley the sadistic head prison guard almost makes him steal the show from Freeman. Frank Darabonts restrained direction of the delicate story is critical for the film to not become sentimental or clich’©d and his beautiful adaptation of the Stephen King story on which the movie is based is a real breath of fresh air. On account of Darabont the film shows that special effects are not needed to tell a great story in film. As a 17-year-old male I love special effects movies as much as the next person but they get boring after a while. Plus many people forget that there was a time in cinema when the blockbuster didnt exist when they made movies that just told great stories and gave the audience a chance to be uplifted by those stories without the creators having to resort to special effects. I applaud you for having the guts to make a non-commercial film that reminds people of that in this day and age Mr. Darabont. SPOILER ALERT As with all truly great films The Shawshank Redemption is full of scenes that have become entrenched in the publics collective consciousness. Theres the scene where Andy plays the opera record over the loudspeaker for all the inmates in the prison Captain Hadley bashing Fat @$$ to death for crying during his first night in prison a very powerful scene Red giving his Rehabilitated speech to the board of parole officials the Warden getting his final judgement and of course Andy crawling to freedom through what Red in his narration calls 500 yards of s**t-smelling foulness I cant even imagine the scene which for me is perhaps the greatest movie scene of the 90s. END OF SPOILERS I thoroughly recommend this cinematic masterpiece which has earned its place in my humble top ten films of all time list to anybody. Whatever gender age religion nationality etc. you are and whatever language you speak I guarantee it will change your life or perhaps even save it. Movies like The Shawshank Redemption only come along once every decade if that. Unforgettable. 10/10.positive,In this Quentin Tarrantino written/directed film it follows three storys set over a few days and all collide together. Warning i have given away LOTS of the story here so dont read on if you dont want to know The first story is where Vincent Vega John Travolta who has just returned from Amsterdam is escorting his boss Marcellus Wallaces Ving Rhames wife Mia Uma Thurman out to dinner. Followed by a twist dance an overdose at a drug dearlers house Eric Stoltz is the first story. the second story starts with a young child being told an amusing story by Captain Koons Christopher Walken about a gold watch the young child grows up to be Butch Coolige Bruce Willis who we see being bribed to go down in the fight earlier on he of course doesnt and gets invoved in a car accident a shoot out and being raped by Z Peter Green along with Marcellus. In the third story which is my favourite we return to where two hitmen Vega and Jules Samuel L Jackson shoot dead some gangsters have a mirical happen to them and have to dispose of a dead body in the back seat of a car with the help of Jimmy Tarrantino and Mr Wolf Harvey Keitel. they then at breakfast all this happens at around 8-10am have to deal with two resterauant robbers Tim Roth and Amanda Plummer who we see discussing robbing the resteraunt at the beggining of the movie. All in all a fabulous movie which is very confusing and you can get something new out of the movie each time. 11/10 its that goodpositive,In this movie a man is mistakenly accused in murdering his wife and her boyfriend. He ends up finding away to keep himself occupy and finally helps out his new found friend. I really like this movie because it does show you that the system can make a mistake just like everyone can. All people make mistakes and since the government is run by humans of course there are going to be flaws. I had watched this movie for the first time with my dad and I loved watching it since. It does show that when you are determined you can do anything you put your mind to. I think anyone who likes movies about prison or even about the judicial system will love this film.positive,In this final extremely satisfying installment of `The Lord Of The Rings trilogy Peter Jackson confirms himself as the Cecil B. DeMille of our time a master purveyor of entertainment and showmanship with superior storytelling skills. Jackson throughout has set out to make his own movies and not become a slave to J.R.R. Tolkiens books awful as they are--I couldnt make it through the last one and this episode particularly benefits from his cinematic vision and the refitting by the writers who in addition to Jackson include Fran Walsh and Phillipa Boyens of major plot points and the deepening of the character motivation so sorely lacking in Tolkiens prosepositive,In these times where an Every man for himself mentality prevails and ones self worth is measured by possessions this movie reminds us that the escalating fear that we all have as this country spirals out of control is best abated by having someone you can call a true friend. As time passes and more of us see that this country is heading inexorably toward social political and economic disaster this movie will find an even larger audience of devotees. Perhaps one day we will abandon our materialism and discover that true hope which we will desperately need and a major theme of this movie lies in our relationships with others. Until then we will have the Shawshank Redemption to remind us what real friendship looks like.positive,In the far western reaches of south west Wales I was lucky to be born to a father who had immaculate taste in film. At the tender age of 14 when I started to understand the complexity of human emotion I was introduced to this beautiful film. I remember the first time I sat and viewed the film my father put the VHS in the video player and left me alone to begin my relationship with this film from the age of 14 I reckon I must have watched this old film twice a year since and every time I still think this is probably the best film I have ever seen. Just thought Id express a little of how I feel about this film hope you dont mind. Alpositive,In the amazingly beautiful way Quentin makes this film come to life its hard to say this isnt one of the greatest films of all time. Its beautifully written and the musical  is absolutely perfect. In his stylish way of filmmaking he seems to make his audience feel as if they are actually there and leaves you wanting more. If this film was three more hours long I would love it even more. There isnt a dull moment throughout the film and not even the slightest moment of boring or not appealing themes or moments. Its non stop beauty and amazement from start to finish. You couldnt ask for a better movie going experience and this film will remain a classic for decades to come from audiences all around the world. Pulp fiction is the kind of movie you and your friends and family talk about and quote endlessly for years to comepositive,in short this film is nothing short of amazing beautifully shot witty writing and with angelina jolies impeccable acting skills this film was always going to be a hit it is truly magical  everything you dreamed of once playing off with the fairies in the imaginary worldof childhood if your looking for a film that gives a sense of escapism this is it angelina is truly underrated whilst the makeup and costume add to the power of her character it is the true aura of herself that brings maleficent to life only she could give the character a true malevolence yet be heart breaking at the same time you really end up feeling for her and realise perhaps all is not always as it seems i would definitely recommend to anyone that is debating watching this film  who knows you may just find your wingspositive,In short supply are the movies which act as cathartic catalysts on a second Š—–or-plus viewing as compellingly and strongly as on the first viewing. The other night overpowered by feelings of despondency and ennui I went to flick through my small collection of movies and on an impulse I picked up The Shawshank Redemption. I savored every moment of the movie even more than my first time a couple of years ago. I chalk it up to its beautifully crafted story its virtuoso and powerhouse performances and its underlying themes of hope resolve and ultimate salvation. This time in his feature directorial debut Frank Darabont has tapped into the wellspring of King the horribles and fashioned a juggernaut of a prison drama out of his novella Rita Hayworth and the shawshank Redemption. This movie stands out among other prison flicks in that it flies in the face of conventions. Contrary to our expectations and cheapened tastes Shawshank does not intend to explore the horrors of prison life as its fulcrum but the way its inhabitants clutch at straws and pull out all stops to extricate themselves from the shackles of the gloom of their claustrophobic mental incarceration against all the odds turns out to be its thematic pull. And the movie pulls it off big time. Among a mosaic of characters events shenanigans and skullduggery the movie mainly delves into the friendship struck up between two lifers. The friendship between Andy Dufresne played convincingly by Tim Robbins who is accused of murdering his wife and her lover and sentenced to serve two concurrent lives and the veteran Red the brilliant Morgan Freeman carries the emotional and inspirational mood of the movie. When a busload of prisoners arrive at the max-security state penitentiary of Shawshank the other felons bet on who is going to burst into tears at the first night of prison life. Red ups his antes on the seemingly brittle fresh fish Andy who was a respectable banker in the outside and is like a fish out of water among a bunch of thick-skinned miscreants. Red loses since Andy turns out to be more redoubtable and impermeable than any prison wall several feet thick. Little do the fellow prisoners realize at first glance what an enigmatic character he is. For the first months he says next to nothing meanders through other prisoners in the prison yard minding his own business and the movie speaks through by-turn humorous poignant and thought-provoking narration of the omniscient Red who is known for smuggling things in and charging a 20% markup for the services he provides. However Reds omniscience is not all-encompassing and Godly enough to bore into the Sphinx-like mind of the introverted Andy even after 19 years. On a tarring occasion he overhears a guard complaining about the taxes he has to pay for an inheritance he screws up his courage to offer him his expert advice on tax evasion. Now he is treated as a special guest since he cooks the books for the prisons powers that be who have hit pay dirt. His financial legerdemain proves to be a double-edged sword. Now he is the victim of his own success. A newcomer is willing to testify to his innocence in the court but the warden regards his accountant too valuable to be expendable. Andy survives several assaults and rapes. He never gives up. He never cracks under pressure. Life is very simple to him: get busy living or get busy dying. He makes the first choice and remains true to it through thick and thin. He lives with hope as his source of salvation. The emotional pull of the movie owes a great deal to the spirited and flawless performances of all the cast members. Morgan Freeman effortlessly inhabits his character as a real free man. Tim Robbins is superlative as a quintessential embodiment of hope and inspiration. James Whitmore as the institutionalized prison trusty who is suicidal in the outside turns in a superlative performance. Hats off to all the performers. The Shawshank Redemption is a prime example of the gap between the box office performance of a movie and its popularity. This movie famously bombed in the box office barely covering its budget. But overtime it gained in such popularity that it has snatched the coveted toppest ranking place in IMDb from such hot favorites and topdogs like Godfather Forrest Gump and Pulp Fiction the last two of which eclipsed Shawshank in 1994 Academy Awards. Perhaps in 1994 the movie lacked the requisite word of mouth that it is enjoying now. All in all Shawshank is a compulsively watchable movie with bits of pleasure withheld in every watching only to be relished on next occasions.positive,In Pulp Fiction Quentin Tarantino uses completely original characters in a plot so original and spellbinding that the final result is th greatest film of all time. The way he is able to separate the plot into vignettes is brilliant. Additionally the hidden imagery adds to the overall depth of the movie.positive,In one word - Unbelievable But I will not stop at just one word. This film is as close to flawless as I have ever seen and on top of that it sets a new standard just as its predecessor did for the superhero film. Lets start with the technical aspects: Visual effects - The visual effects are simply mind - blowing The action moves seamlessly through the city. With even the most impossible things brought back to sheer realism. It shifts with ease between the normal and I - Max camera shots. The truck jacknife scene that includes the the batpod is especially thrilling. Directinng and Scriptwriting - Christopher Nolan directs with the hand of a cinematic master effortlessly blending action romance humor and drama. The writing from Christopher and his brother John is fantastic Giving depth to all the characters and bringing in character growth that goes beyond the conventions of a superhero film. Now that this has been handled lets go to the acting all of the actors deliver stellar performances bringing the struggles of the characters to full realisation but the star of the show has to be Heath ledger in a wonderfully chilling and menacingly insane performance Losing him was such a loss to the film industry. So for a thrilling and exhausting masterpiece do not look any further than the Dark Knight.positive,In my top ten list this resides happily at #2. Christopher Nolan is known for giving the Batman films new life with his amazing first film. With the sequel he blew me and everybody else away with a good story amazing action and top notch performances by all. I consider the opening bank heist car chase and the conversation between batman and joker to be three of the best scenes ever made in history. I will not be saying anything new when I mention the scale of Heath Ledgers performance as the joker. Many will say that Nicholson was the best. While I do admire Nicholson I personally think that Heaths performance was nowhere in the same ballpark as Nicholsons. This is a batman masterpiece and Nolan def. knows how to please an audience. I have never heard the kind of applause that I heard after the movie ended when I saw it. Everyone cheered because it was just so great. The Dark Knight can never be duplicated. While it is sad that this role led to Ledgers death he left in the highest point of his life. I couldnt be more proud of him. A lot and I mean a lot of people complain about the Batman voice. I liked the voice that Christian did. The most important factor of Batman is that he be distinctly different than Bruce Wayne. In the past the other Batmans have had relatively the same voice as Bruce Wayne. In this film the voice is strong and aggressive. There were two occasions that I didnt understand him but after watching multiple times I figured it out. After watching the movie I did have a few minor gripes like a wish the fight between the two had been better and that they had put two face in the next movie instead of him being in for the last half hour but I got over it and dont care anymore because the fact is that this movie is just down right f**king awesome and should not be missed by any fan of Batman.positive,In my opinion this is the one movie that is absolutely the greatest the first time you watch it. Its probably my favorite movie. It may not have the replay value of some of my other favorites but the first time you watch it when you dont know what is about to happen is the probably the greatest thing you can experience in terms of movies. I only wish could I forget it so I could watch it again for the first time. As a matter of fact if I ever suffered complete amnesia there would be at least one definite benefit. I am not going to talk about the ending and for gods sake if anybody puts a spoiler warning on their comments do not read thempositive,In my opinion these one of the best film of ever. The reason is obviously the story: Tolkien is a master in telling adventures and this is his masterpiecepositive,in my opinion its better than the ordinary Monte Cristo story that we all know as the greatest escape tale  so this time the escape is greater and the hero is an ordinary man  who is so patient and hopeful while you watch the first few minutes of the film you may think that its social or silly story but minute by minute you will recognize that you were wrong its a Brilliant Storya never seen before  a very powerful drama .. the best thing in that movie was the relations between characterslike hatingand true friendship like the one which was between Tim Robins and Morgan Freeman I like this movie and i advice every one on the planet to watch it as soon as possible....positive,in my opinion i believe this movie was an epic tail of a boy whos parents were murdered by a thug. until one day the boy decided to take action and soon became the protagonist in this movie also would be known as Batman.our hero the Dark night tends to protect the civilians of Gothem city from his worst enemies and other so forth criminals. the antagonist is an evil but smart man named Bane. Bane and his army tend to defeat Batman and take over the city but Batman does not allow it and an epic battle is created with many detail and quality. i would highly recommend this film to all viewers who are DC comic fans of DC movie watchers. but if you just want action and adventure this is the movie for all of you viewers.  even though in a way it is not entirely unexpected. It is particularly enlivened by the presence of Morgan Freeman who should have won an Oscar for his voice-overs alone. In a word Exceptional. positive,In my humble opinion the greatest comic book film ever made. To start Heath Ledger made the film. His performance as The Joker was one of the greatest performances ever given which is made even more amazing by the fact that just by looking at him or the films he has done where he is the pretty hero you would never see him as this iconic villain. He got the right balance of creepy psychopathic and at times funny making it the best performance of The Joker in history. It was a shame when he passed and that he never received the Oscar himself that he most definitely deserved but at least he as a man who took pride in his work left behind a performance and a legacy that many actors could only dream of. Aaron Eckhart was awesome as Harvey Dent/two-face as well. The turn from being the white knight cop to the murdering two-face was not an easy one to do and I dont think many actors would have got it right but Eckhart did and was very convincing as Dent. The returning cast Bale Caine Freeman Oldman etc. where fantastic particularly Bale who had to take on a new stage in Batmans life where he is now an established protector of Gotham but now must put his own codes and rules when facing his greatest foe. The music was awesome and Hans Zimmer as well as his team have really gone out of their way to create a Batman theme that I believe is as iconic as John Williams Superman theme. Christopher Nolan redeemed the Batman franchise with Batman Begins and took it to new heights with this masterpiece The Dark Knight you will all just have to wait and see where the franchise ended with the final chapter The Dark Knight Rises. The Dark Knight is not only the best film in Nolans Batman franchise but also the best comic book based film ever.  not just for characters in a movie but for a better life and a better world for all of us. 10/10 positive,In its Oscar year Shawshank Redemption written and directed by Frank Darabont after the novella Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption by Stephen King was nominated for seven Academy Awards and walked away with zero. Best Picture went to Forrest Gump while Shawshank and Pulp Fiction were just happy to be nominated. Of course hindsight is 20/20 but while history looks back on Gump as a good film Pulp and Redemption are remembered as some of the all-time best. Pulp however was a success from the word go making a huge splash at Cannes and making its writer-director an American master after only two films. For Andy Dufresne and Co. success didnt come easy. Fortunately failure wasnt a life sentence. After opening on 33 screens with take of $727327 the $25M film fell fast from theatres and finished with a mere $28.3M. The reasons for failure are many. Firstly the title is a clunker. While iconic to fans today in 1994 people knew not and cared not what a Shawshank was. On the DVD Tim Robbins laughs recounting fans congratulating him on that Rickshaw movie. Marketing-wise the films a nightmare as prison drama is a tough sell to women and the story of love between two best friends doesnt spell winner to men. Worst of all the movie is slow as molasses. As Desson Thomson writes for the Washington Post it wanders down subplots at every opportunity and ignores an abundance of narrative exit points before settling on its finale. But it is these same weaknesses that make the film so strong. Firstly its setting. The opening aerial shots of the prison are a total eye-opener. This is an amazing piece of architecture strong and Gothic in design. Immediately the prison becomes a character. It casts its shadow over most of the film its tall stone walls stretching above every shot. It towers over the men it contains blotting out all memories of the outside world. Only Andy Robbins holds onto hope. Its in music its in the sandy beaches of Zihuatanejopositive,in guardians of the galaxy we have peter quill chris pratt a scavenger that was picked up from earth as a young boy locating an orb that contains one of the infinity stones while on nova he gets in a fight with gamora zoe saldana for the stone meanwhile rocket and groot bradley cooper and vin diesel are trying to capture quill they are all arrested and sent to the kyln prison where they meet up with another inmate drax dave bautista they may fight and bicker but they come together as a team and a family to defeat ronan lee pace before be can destroy nova this leads us to the theme of the movie teamwork the first time they work as a team is when break out of the kyln they all gathered the items that rocket needed to break them out even though they worked as a team they still hadnt gelled together yet that came at the end of the movie during the battle with ronan if this theme sounds familiar to you it should it took place two years earlier on earth when nick fury samuel l jackson brought together a group of extraordinary superheroes called the avengers it can also be found in the fantastic four from 2005 and the league of extraordinary gentlemen in 2003 a technique that we saw used during the film to show the development of the theme was developing characters this is the most evident with draxs character when he is introduced in the kyln he is all about revenge and killing gamora the change in drax happens on nowhere when groot saves him from drowning when ronan throws him in a vat of liquid the development finalizes on ronans ship the dark aster when they are walking to the bridge and he realizes that the rest of the guardians are his friends another technique used during the film is ensemble acting while all five of the guardians have different backgrounds and came from different places they all have different skills that help out the team for example rocket is very good with building weapons for the team to use while gamora can use her intellect and military training like i mentioned the theme is teamwork like loki tom hiddleston for the avengers and professor m in the league of extraordinary gentlemen richard roxburgh the guardians used a common cause to bring them together that was ronan in this film they now have a bond that will serve them well against other foespositive,In every trilogy the third was not the strongest mostly the first sometimes the second. But in the LOTR its the third film that is the best the strongest and the greatest one. A terrific climax and a beautiful ending. But it was sad because there will be no LOTR next year:-. Everything that has a beginning has an end. In my comment for Matrix Revolutions I said that the Matrix failed where LOTR will succeed. Ive never been SO right in my whole life. The movie is one whole thrill. 3 hours and of suspense darkness and despair and the resting 20 minutes were just beautiful and gave the movie a perfect ending. But there is always hope a light at the end of the tunnel. The special effects were the best ever. The battle in Minas Tirith the battle at the Black Gate and the fight between Frodo Sam and Shelob. Matrix Reloaded and Revolutions were also breathtaking but they overwhelmed the characters the characters in LOTR stay strong and stronger than ever especially Aragorn Sam Gollum and Frodo. I watched the movie twice and there were two scenes that made my flesh creep the Rohirrim attacking the Orcs and a silent Shelob behind Frodo really spooky. The battle and the nature of good and evil have never been so deep amazing and beautiful as before. But I was totally satisfied at the end where Sam says his last line. The last line in the film was the same last line as in the book. Then I went back to my home never been so happy. 10/10  he totally rocked in the previous films. Telling us to wait for the extended version isnt right. Maybe Jackson should have foregone one of the too many endings in ROTK to give Lee some film time. That said all the elements that worked in the previous movies were absolutely glorious in this film. The one new thing that I would add to so much that has already been written is that big kudos must go to the great Tolkien artists Alan Lee and John Howe whose artistry shaped so much of the imagery from the first moments of FOTR to the final scenes of ROTK. This historic trilogy would not have been the same without them. The LOTR enterprise has clearly been a great labor of love from all who worked on it over the years and this final installment was a crowning achievement positive,In an era when filmmakers of mediocre ability can get financing to do grunge slash thrillers or sex-pie college comedies of Farrelly-manque nonsense this poll serves to illustrate the gratitude of fans everywhere at being served such a luscious 9 course meal of a film. Or 3 of them. At the Directors own insistence the writing the production the editing the art design the sound planning the actors/characters the costumes the music the effects. Everything was delivered until the limits almost gave. None of these and ALL of them are the stars. To say this vote reflects only appreciation of the special effects is to disingenuously shoulder aside the leadership and dedication and commitment from ALL teams required to produce not just one but all three films to such incredible standards of consistency to the books while pleasing worldwide fans and new audiences as well as all ages. Schindlers List was not Spielbergs story by authorship any more than Tolkiens was Jacksons both borrowed a cultural event one historical one literary story to exploit on the big screen using the appropriate talent. Thats what filmmakers do. And if theyre smart they get the right material. I dont think Spielberg could have delivered LOTR. But I have a funny feeling PJ might have come close to SL. Both proved their genius by traveling outside their closest strength positions and moved to new arenas. Both borrowed from past projects and knowledge of film to create the dramatic impacts they engineered in those films.You cannot say because one was historically based then it was by that ilk superior. Schindlers List may be the most sociologically impactful movie ever made but it was not the best. There was exploitation and the Nazis character was colored fancifully and Schindler was not the spitting image of Liam Neesam etc etc. You can read history without the women prostituting themselves and children lying in outhouse filth. Spielberg made the same kinds of decisions making that movie Jackson did making rings but each used special effects of a different kind. Did Naziism happen in black and white That anyone would seek to disprove Rings popularity by citing the more proximate and non-disputed sociological consciousness raised by SL is gaging on the wrong scale. I would not pay to see SL again once as enough. But Ive paid a dozen times X3and for the extended DVDs to relive Tolkiens world because like those characters I believe theres something good in this world worth fighting for. And Jacksons world gives me and others a place to go to encourage us. The films are about Hope. Wasnt THAT the message from Schindler as wellpositive,In 2003 Lord of the Rings- Return of the King won top honors at nearly every major Award ceremony and set a new record for box-office receipts one that would stand for six years. It blew audiences away with its epic storytelling and scale surpassing even the previous two entries in the trilogy. It was a truly great film. And now with the extended version its even better than before. The reason why Return of the King is so great is threefold. First its based on one of the twentieth centurys greatest works of literature. Secondly director Peter Jackson has remained true to source material leaving as much as possible intact. And lastly this project saw a near unprecedented infusion of talent and money. From the director to the extremely large cast to the effects wizards at WETA everyone knew what they were doing and gave it their very best. Nothing was held back no expense spared and no detail overlooked and the result is pure awesomeness. One of Tolkiens greatest talents as a writer was his ability to fill his worlds with a host of distinct interesting characters each with their own strengths weaknesses and struggles. Jackson has included nearly all and through them explores myriad themes. In Aragorn Vigo Mortenson we see a man who overcome his self-doubt and accept the mantle of greatness that he was meant to wear. Hes also the embodiment of true courage being brave or perhaps crazy enough to pick up the seeing stone and tell Sauron Here I am come and get me. In Frodo Elijah Wood the story explores how even the most ordinary of people can accomplish great things but also how even the purest can be tempted by power and corrupted by evil. One figure who cannot be corrupted however is Samwise Gamgee who represents perhaps the ultimate example of friendship and loyalty sharing every hardship remaining ever vigilant against Gollums treachery and the rings corruption and braving a giant spider and a fortress of orcs to rescue his friend even after he had turned on him. Even the relatively minor Characters are well drawn and add to the story. Take Pippin and Merry. Theyre just a couple of goof-offs the friends who are just along for the ride. But before the story is done both will play important roles in the greatest battle of the age. Aeowen for her part embodies both duty to ones people and the the pain of unrequited love. And Legalos and Gimli though largely relegated to sidekick duty still show how friendship can transcend racial boundaries and old grudges. But the most interesting character of all must surely be Gollum. Twisted physically and mentally and with a severe case of split personality he hates his very existence and he hates the Ring for what its done to him but he desires to possess it even more. Hes like a schizoid drug addict- a violent yet often hilarious schizoid drug addict. Its amazing how quickly he can go from playful and comical to pure venom. And no-one does a more unsettling conversation with himself. Hes murderous hes repulsive hes pitiful and hes one of the most interesting characters in twentieth century literature. Of course this isnt all internal struggles and character development  just made for a perfect ending. Through all the movies you see the characters go from complete strangers and in some cases enemies to close friends. Only the strongest friendships are formed in the toughest of situations. This series shows that perfectly. To see the struggles and the victories brought to life so well is amazing. I would definitely recommend this and all the other Lord of The Rings or The Hobbit movies to any fantasy movie lovers. positive,In 1995 when I was fourteen out of the blue I saw in a newspaper that one of my favorite Stephen King stories Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption had finally made its way to the silver screen. It wasnt showing at the Hoyts/Greater Union cinemas rather a local independent/art-house cinema. Of course that didnt bother me so I went. Over 2hours long Shawshank swept you into another world. Stephen Kings short-novel was very faithfully adapted. Three pieces of brilliance stood out then and still do today. 1 First the film was brilliantly paced never a dull moment. Having read the short-novel before hand didnt diminish any expectations. 2 Second a brilliant cast. Sheer brilliance from Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins as Red and Andy Dufresne. Very strong supporting cast in Bob Gunton - the cruel Warden Sam Norton other inmates: Gill Bellows as young Tommy Williams James Whitmore the elderly Brooks brilliant expansion of character that short novel only dealt with in two paragraphs. Yet the show was stolen by Clancy Brown. Browns legendary performance as Captain Bryon Hadley one guy you clearly didnt want on your case 3 Finally what remains in my mind the most from Reds last parole-hearing to the end of the film. Words cant simply convey the emotions this was what I didnt except. It was so powerfully done. My favorite quote: Andy Dufresne: Get busy living or get busy dying.  Enough said.positive,In 1947 banker Andy Dufresne Tim Robbins is convicted of murdering his wife and her lover based on circumstantial evidence and is sentenced to two consecutive life sentences at Shawshank State Penitentiary. Andy quickly befriends contraband smuggler Ellis Red Redding Morgan Freeman an inmate serving a life sentence. Red procures a rock hammer for Andy allowing him to create small stone chess pieces. Red later gets him a large poster of Rita Hayworth followed in later years by images of Marilyn Monroe and Raquel Welch. Andy works in the prison laundry but is regularly assaulted by the bull queer gang the Sisters and their leader Bogs Mark Rolston. In 1949 Andy overhears the brutal chief guard Byron Hadley Clancy Brown complaining about taxes on a forthcoming inheritance and informs him about a financial loophole. After another vicious assault by the Sisters nearly kills Andy Hadley severely beats Bogs resulting in Bogs being sent to another prison. Andy is not attacked again. Warden Samuel Norton Bob Gunton meets with Andy and reassigns him to the prison library to assist elderly inmate Brooks Hatlen James Whitmore a pretext for Andy to manage financial duties for the prison. His advice and expertise are soon sought by other guards at Shawshank and from nearby prisons. Andy begins writing weekly letters to the state government for funds to improve the decrepit library. In 1954 Brooks is freed on parole but unable to adjust to the outside world after 50 years in prison he hangs himself. Andy receives a library donation that includes a recording of The Marriage of Figaro. He plays an excerpt over the public address system resulting in his receiving solitary confinement. After his release Andy explains that he holds onto hope as something that the prison cannot take from him but Red dismisses the idea. In 1963 Norton begins exploiting prison labor for public works profiting by undercutting skilled labor costs and receiving kickbacks. He has Andy launder the money using the alias Randall Stephens. In 1965 Tommy Williams Gil Bellows is incarcerated for burglary. He joins Andys and Reds circle of friends and Andy helps him pass his General Educational Development G.E.D. examinations. In 1966 after hearing the details of Andys case Tommy reveals that an inmate at another prison claimed responsibility for an identical murder suggesting Andys innocence. Andy approaches Norton with this information but the warden refuses to listen. Norton places Andy in solitary confinement and has Hadley murder Tommy under the guise of an escape attempt. Andy refuses to continue with the scam but Norton threatens to destroy the library and take away his protection and preferential treatment. After Andy is released from solitary confinement he tells Red of his dream of living in Zihuatanejo a Mexican Pacific coastal town. While Red shrugs it off as being unrealistic Andy instructs him should he ever be freed to visit a specific hayfield near Buxton to retrieve a package. The next day at roll call upon finding Andys cell empty an irate Norton throws one of Andys rocks at the poster of Raquel Welch hanging on the wall. The rock tears through the poster revealing a tunnel that Andy had dug with his rock hammer over the previous two decades. The previous night Andy escaped through the tunnel and the prisons sewage pipe with Nortons ledger containing details of the money laundering. While guards search for him the following morning Andy posing as Randall Stephens visits several banks to withdraw the laundered money. Finally he sends the ledger and evidence of the corruption and murders at Shawshank to a local newspaper. The police arrive at Shawshank and take Hadley into custody while Norton commits suicide to avoid arrest. After serving 40 years Red receives parole. He struggles to adapt to life outside prison and fears he never will. Remembering his promise to Andy he visits Buxton and finds a cache containing money and a letter asking him to come to Zihuatanejo. Red violates his parole and travels to Fort Hancock Texas to cross the border to Mexico admitting he finally feels hope. On a beach in Zihuatanejo he finds Andy and the two friends are happily reunited.positive,In 1947 Andy Dufresne vice president of a bank in Portland is accused of killing his wife and lover of this a famous golfer and sentenced to life imprisonment for each although no conclusive evidence of authorship  being sent to Shawshank. He is above the average of others who believe a snob though Red one of the most popular men prisoners get to ask everything you like and soon become friends which does not relieve you of fall into the hands of Sisters about homosexuals who do not leave you alone. Red lends a hand and you choose to fix a roof outside the prison. There listens Andy financial problems of a guardian and offers to save. That makes his fame transcends and in a few years made the statements of all of his prison guards and other county. It also serves to definitely get rid of your stalkers of concern to guard. He also placed in charge of the prison library where you write a letter every week to the Senate for funds to it with its insistence getting the best prison library in all of New England. But see also the despair inside having spent his entire life in prison does not want to go outside where everything is hostile to them. The old Brooks former manager of the library outside is nothing and commits suicide. He has a special treatment to keep the accounts of the corrupt warden that prisoners performing work with which anyone can compete and companies who want to work you must pay a hefty commission that Andy becomes white money inventing a fictitious character where even get legal papers. Andy is also responsible for helping those who wish to study including Tommy a boy who wants to change his life. Thanks to him Tommy manages to get the graduate. And is the guy who tells him that in one of the prisons in which he was matched with a guy who told her he had killed a golfer and his mistress and the fact that her husband accused her. Andy sees in confession a glimmer of hope which is truncated by the warden that does not help and ends with the only thread of hope making kill Tommy. Andy himself will spend two months in solitary confinement for refusing to follow accounting warden. The output will return to it but that night disappears from his cell without anyone knowing what happened to him until they discover a tunnel after a large poster of Raquel Welch. And once outside the bank will draw up character warden $ 300000 in addition to sending a letter with proof of corruption all the press. Norton commits suicide. Some time later after 40 years in prison is released Network For him life on the outside is as absurd as to Brooks and think back to crime to return to their home. It only holds a promise I made to Andy that he would go to a field where there was something for him. He does and finds enough money to go to the place where Andy said that if one day be installed leaving a Mexican village by the Pacific where a hotel ride. Red goes there to be his assistant. Great movie you see them.positive,IMDb Top 250: 12 The Lord of the Rings: Return of the King is an incredible conclusion to the trilogy a masterpiece of its genre and a fantastic film. It wraps up everything and has the biggest most grand epic battle ever. If youve seen the first two films and just havent found time for the third go make time and reward yourself four 3 and a half hours. The opening scene came completely out of left field and left me thinking. It shows how Smeagol came to acquire the Ring and the power it instantly had over him. We also see what the mad creature looked like before he was well Gollum. Its a great flashback like a Lost flashback and lets us learn about of the most interesting characters in the mythology. Then like a good conclusion there is buildup. The characters reunite and realize that this is it the final battle. At the same time Frodo and Sam begin to near the end of their journey and their scenes actually serve a purpose. We see the Black Gate and the emergence of Saurons army with the too-cool Witch King. We watch the seaside town by Gondor fall easily and later a grisly part involving catapults and heads that seemed just a tad too mature but reminds the viewer the ferocity and primitive nature of the Orcs. In a grand montage the beacons are lit signalling Rohan to aid. During this Aragorn Legolas and Gimli go to find aid from elsewhere. The stage is set for a huge battle. And what a battle it is. Other than the Mines this is easily the single greatest scene in the trilogy. It takes up a good chunk of the film. The scale and visual realization is unrivalled. The elephants complete the scene as well as the Witch Kings fate. Its spellbinding. The Ring finally taking a toll on Frodo nears Mount Doom. While the giant war is a massive battle the Ring quest is a small battle. Frodo tragically has degenerated with Sam having to push him to the end. The scene inside the volcano is amazing as well as Frodos line. These two plots are interwoven and create the most remarkable fantasy ever on screen. After all is said and done we are treated to a bittersweet epilogue showing what happens to the characters giving good closure. Return of the King is a stunning film worthy of its Oscar glory and critical praise. Ill let the number speak for itself. 9.6/10positive,Im writing this purely for being able to cross it off my profile checklist that I havent done in about 2 years Im pretty sure everyone as seen or at least heard that this one of the greatest movies of all time so Im not going to get into all that It sure is one of mine All right I tried to submit it but it wouldnt accept it without 10 lines so bear with me here I really really really really love this movie yes that got me to the next line so I would definitely recommend it to anyone If you havent seen it go watch it Now You wont be disappointed Thanks for readingpositive,Im trying to save you moneypositive,Im sure theres no doubt about it that this Quentin Tarantino masterpiece is the best film of the decade and one of the best films ever Original funny bloody disgusting this film has left everyone shocked Its incredible and originally written plot is the key of the films succes and thats what people like about it This is a 9 out of 10 movie you dont have to use the 10 You never know what is going to come nextpositive,Im sure everyone has covered the obvious genius of this movie so Im just going to write about the little things I enjoy Im sure many people love to see this movie over and over again but since I have so many things memorized as all of you Im sure Dont Lie I like to space it out and look at it in a fresh way each time Too bad it can never be as fresh as the first time but the exhiliration and thrill is still there Its so cool how Tarantino can put everything he loves about cult movies and throw in some very spicy international women into the brew Not to mention surf guitar and cartoon homages and present ethnic slurs in such an inoffensive way that it shows the whole inanity and ridiculousness of it all I also like how Quentin puts little things that you can catch brand new after 20 or so viewings You might not have noticed or even have cared for that matter but in almost every scene theres a little thing going sometimes on the edge of the screen that makes this more than a hip ultraviolent cult fave I like how the scene involving Christopher Walken and the young Butch Walken almost changes every word in explaining Butchs fathers death for the sake of Butch and his mother Also at the end if you pay attention to the extras in the resteraunt they look like real bystanders in a hold-up I also sometimes find myself asking questions about the characters and imagine them outside the movie Like Rosanna Arquette and Eric Stoltz I always imagine them getting high and cheating on each other Not to mention Tarantino putting questions out there for us What is in that suitcase after allpositive,Im so glad Peter Jackson adapted these brilliant books from JRR Tolkien... A world in which we can escape as spectator and as actor too... Thank you Mr Jackson  We can travel in Middle Earth through the beautiful work of the whole crew and those Oscars were widely deserved. The Hobbit Trilogy is different but I trust Peter Jackson to finish it with wits and through the whole experience of those ten last years. Im waiting to see There and Back Again though cause the end wont be easy to adapt. Hopefully it should blow everyones mind  A Mellon hobbit in modern times.positive,im Robbins plays Andy Dufresne a city banker wrongfully convicted of murdering his wife and her lover. He is sent to Shawshank Prison in 1947 and receives a double life sentence for the crime. Andy forms an unlikely friendship with Red Morgan Freeman the man who knows how to get things. Andy faces many trials in prison but forms an alliance with the wardens because he is able to use his banking experience to help the corrupt officials amass personal fortunes. The story unfolds.... I was so impressed with how every single subplot was given a great deal of respect and attention from the director. The acting was world-class. I have never seen Tim Robbins act as well since Morgan Freeman maybe e.g. Seven. The twists were unexpected an although this film had a familiar feel it wasnt even slightly pretentious or clich’©d it was original. The cinematography was grand and expressive. It gave a real impression of the sheer magnitude of this daunting prison.positive,Im really looking forward to the last film of the The Dark Knight trilogy The Dark Knight Rises which will be released in this summer. So I reviewed Batman Begins and The Dark Knight. I was quite impressed by them. The story of Batman Begins is about the reason why Bruce Wayne became Batman and the story of The Dark Knight is about overcoming adversity. But at the same time he lost a lot of things and became the dark knight. Alfred a faithful butler of Bruce Wayne talked to Bruce when Bruce returned from his work as a Batman with his injury. Alfred: Now your limit master Wayne. Bruce: Batman has no limit. Alfred: But you dosir. At this time Bruce hadnt realized the fact that even Batman had his limit. Harvey Dent a prosecutor believing in justice and Bruce were fighting against the evil in Gotham City together. Harvey talked to the citizen of Gotham City about hope. Harvey: The night is darkest just before dawn. I promise you Dawn is coming. They were heroes so they were bound by their morality. For example Batman could never kill anyone. But their enemy Joker was completely free from any rules. He could do anything and drove them into the corner. Joker: Im an agent of chaos. Oh do you know about chaos Its fear. Bruce realized his inability and talked to Alfred. Bruce: What do I have to do Alfred: Endure master Wayne. And then Batman tried to wiretap all people in Gotham City in order to find where Joker was. Batman: Beautiful isnt it Fox: Beautiful unethical dangerous. This is wrong. In the end Harvey dropped into his dark side like Darth Vader. Joker: I took Gothams white knight and I brought him to our level. It wasnt hard. Madness as you know is like gravity. All I take is a little push. Harvey: The world is cruel. The only morality in the cruel world is chance. Batman dared to suffer the disgrace saving Harveys honor as Gothams white knight. At the end of The Dark Knight Batman as a dark knight was chased by police. Gordon: Hes a silent guardian a watchful protector a dark knight. Id like to talk a little about myself. When I was 20s and 30s I believed that I had no limit. If I had been serious I could do anything I thought. But in fact I was never so serious and I couldnt accomplish anything. After I have suffered from depression I realized that I had my own limit. I asked myself what I had to do and just endured my worthlessness. So I can understand how Harvey and Bruce felt. I myself can come back to our society. Im looking forward to seeing how Batman as a dark knight will get himself back in The Dark Knight Rises.positive,im not sure if this may contain any spoilers but before you read make sure you at least seen trailer spoilers this film is just brilliant the action emotional comedy lovevery entertaining this film will not bore you one bit youll enjoy every single part of the movie its that good acting was amazing so many new faces soundtrack was awesome storyline was perfect and action just takes it all besides the amazing fashion and style of this film very classy the suits gadgets everything is amazing stop reading reviews just watch this movie you will love it and wont regret it 1010positive,Im not going to waste your time by writing a long review. I have a couple of short words for you guys. This movie was truly amazing. I loved it from beginning to end. Christopher Nolan created the best Batman there has been to date. Heath Ledger definitely made a amazing character. There has never been a better joker in all of history in my opinion. Christian Bale as the Batman was the perfect. I loved it. The action sequences were so realistic that I actually thought Batman could really exist. Christopher Nolan made this film very realistic indeed. Everything in the movie seems possible in real life.positive,Im not going to sit here and go into a deep explanation of what this film is about because that has been thoroughly explained in many of the other reviews. What I will say is that The Shawshank Redemption is without any doubt the most amazing film ever written. The acting is tremendous the story is original and the movie itself has a deeper meaning to it. This movie is not about the hardships of prison it is about the importance of friendship and the realization that hope is your greatest aspect. This piece does not focus as much on Andy and his great escape from Shawshank but more on Red finding that there is always meaning and a purpose for everything. The story really unfolds when Brooks an old timer that Andy and Red had been close friends with is put on parole and released from prison. After confronting the outside world and knowing that he could not cope with it Brooks finds that he has no purpose outside of life in jail and hangs himself. Later in the movie after Andy makes his great escape from prison Red is finally released from Shawshank himself and is put in the same situation as Brooks. Only one reason marks the fact that Red himself didnt commit suicide. That reason is Andy. Red figures out that he does have a purpose outside of prison which is to see his best friend again and to give him a handshake. And as the movie comes to a marvelous ending that hope to see Andy becomes a reality. Overall the best movie I have ever watched and I am glad to say that I will continue to keep watching it again and again and again.positive,im not going to give any clues to the plot this film needs to be seen without knowing the end its very rare that the entire audience remains silent and seated when the lights go up brilliantly acted  ben afleck and rosamund pike were superb they played 2 very complex characters incredibly well i found it very hard to feel biased towards either of the main characters which i think was intended the film is very pared down in how it was shot which enabled the viewer to completely concentrate on the characters there were admittedly some parts which were less believable but they didnt take away from the overall enjoyment i need to see this again and againpositive,Im not going to explain the plot of this film. There is a plot but it doesnt matter. Pulp Fiction is a film with as much style as any film Ive ever seen. The acting is fantastic career best for all. Travolta is hilarious as Vincent a dopey gangster. He just got back from Amsterdam where they call a quarter pounder with cheese a royale with cheese. Vincents partner is Jules played by Samuel L. Jackson. Jackson is hands down the best part of this film. Hes charismatic quotable and unforgettable in his portrayal of Jules. Uma Thurman also brings depth and charisma to a seemingly insignificant character. Bruce Willis is the best hes been also. Admittedly I believe the script is so good it makes the performances seem better than they actually are. The music in the film is perfect very energetic. The visual style is gorgeous some of the best editing in any film Ive seen. The cinematography is all so arresting. Pulp Fiction is noted for its nonlinear storytelling but its unfortunately also noted for some horrible ripoffs by no talent hacks. Fun fact: Tarantino always borrows from obscure movies he loves but he always makes the homages simple and insignificant to the story and characters.positive,Im not comic book fanatic dont read them at all. Not even real Batman fan... But still I can surely say this is the best movie I ever saw. The plot acting effects story soundtrack... Everything is just perfect. The way you can make such non-serious stuff like comic book character in to really serious movie is simply the work of art which this movie really is. When I see better movie then this Ill let everybody know about it. Actors are all great for the roll. So sad about Ledger. Even tho hes not with us anymore after watching this movie I consider him the best actor of our time. Hell the best actor of all times by my opinion. This role simply made him that.positive,im not a wellknown film critic but this is my first film that i have gave a ten out of ten rating we all know that its that time of the year again for production companies to start pumping out their best material for the academy award season some companies think their is a system to putting together a great film other companies actually take the time to put together a great film crew and good actors this was one of those companies consider this film a headstart on david finchers race to an award for best director or best picture either one is fine everything about this film is almost perfect to the directing editing acting even the font for the creditspositive,im not a disney fan i never cared for the princess themed films i never understood why the queen in snow white or maleficent in sleeping beauty were at all threatened in beauty or charm or intellect by the youth in each film this film is absolutely brilliant it finally shows a view that makes sense from a story telling stand point it shows the grace and charm of a character who is not a princess by title and it has a clear beginning middle and end for all motivation on the part of principle characters this might be one of the single best narrated film in the entire history of disney and perhaps of all time this might be the single best character actress performance by angelina jolie since gia or possibly of her entire career this cast might be the most simplistic yet perfect cast ever put together to tell a small story in a tremendously beautiful way with universal messages that cross all relationships i knew i would appreciate jolie on the big screen what i didnt know is that the story is by its telling in this film now a classic story anything including the original animated version pales by comparison i cant say its the greatest film ive seen or the best this year or any of those things because it can not be put into any of those categories nor compared to any other film this film in some way i believe simply by the story itself and how it is told stands apart from any film ive seen in quite possibly decades i saw it went out to the box office got another ticket and saw it again and i plan to see it again if possible i saw the 2d version i am not a 3d or imax person and i am not a fan of bluray but this film needs to be seen in any and all formats if you thought the lord of the rings films or the hobbit films were beautifully done they cant even be compared to the telling of this tale maleficent might be the most brilliantly told story ive seen in my entire life and ive seen many many films in many genres i want to read it as it is told in the film and i think in the telling this version is the only version need ever be told absolutely magnificent im spellboundpositive,Im just gonna start off by saying I love this movie.Its one of my favorites of all time. I honestly cant think of too much wrong with this movie other than its a little long and Batmans by now infamous voice. But everything else is top notch. The actingstoryatmosphereand actions scenes are all amazing. If you havent seen this movie see it right now I went into this not expecting to much but I came out blown away I cant imagine any movie being much better. Ill just have to wait for The Dark Knight Rises to release to see if anything can be better. Until then this stands as the best movie Ive ever seenpositive,im in my 20s and its been a long time since ive actually enjoyed watching a fairytale cinderella helped me fall in love with fairy tales again i actually think that now as an adult i can appreciate fairy tales more than when i was a kid what i love most about the movie is that it promotes kindness and courage which may sound clich but in the movie we see that kindness attracts the right kind of people without kindness cinderella would have never attracted the prince that first day in the forest and she would have never attracted the fairy godmother if cinderella had become bitter and angry like her stepmother and stepsisters she would have not only made herself no better than them but she would have pushed away the prince and the fairy godmother and her life probably would have stayed the same or even worse she may have ended up just like her stepmother and step sisters i never realized it before but cinderella is more of a story about kindness and forgiveness although it is a romantic story too i think the romance element of the story is not the most important part of this storypositive,im in my 20s and its been a

was a kid what i love most about the movie is that it promotes kindness and courage which may sound clich_ but in the movie we see that kindness attracts the right kind of people without kindness cinderella would have never attracted the prince that first day in the forest and she would have never attracted the fairy godmother if cinderella had become bitter and angry like her stepmother and stepsisters she would have not only made herself no better than them but she would have pushed away the prince and the fairy godmother and her life probably would have stayed the same or even worse she may have ended up just like her stepmother and step sisters i never realized it before but cinderella is more of a story about kindness and forgiveness although it is a romantic story too i think the romance element of the story is not the most important part of this storypositive,im going to make this short sweet and simple oscar for best picture boyhood best director richard linklater best

sadly that never happened but ever since i read that i wondered what an rrated bond might be like i dont know maybe matthew vaughn has read that interview too and saw the potential because kingsman is

about matthew teaming up with christopher for their new movie i dont have words to explain about this movie this movie is a masterpiece based on the importance of the humanity how important our species to us? whom will you save when you get the edge of your life? is it the species or its just your family or you save yourself and leave others? do you follow your heart or your mind? these are the questions we face when we watch this movie cast is excellent christopher explained about a theory theory which says that we are not alone there are beings out there who are superior to us or its just usthey who will evolve in the future one thing is for sure the person whos going to watch this movie should have some imagination skills and a good grip on physics i got a lot to tell but i dont

are top notch but im a big big fan of fight club and no movie of his has been this good but i think gone girl came pretty close though both movies are just little different but the twist is mind blower gone girl focuses on the dark side of domesticity that how a family can be this disturbed ill try no to spill any spoilers but ill tell you that the spoiler is revealed at the middle but the amazing thing is that it still hooks you to watch the rest and the ending i think cant be that good ben affleck as nick dunne was amazing but omg rosamund pike as amy dunne aka gone girl was brilliant excellent and marvelous i will only say this that she has the every right to win the academy since this is an adaption to gillian flynns book which she also writes the screenplay which i think was very clever from fincher to choose gillian for this job and she excellently done it the movie is very much to the book and everything goes as i hoped if you are choosing the movie to watch first its okay but read the book also its brilliant this is a mystery thriller movie and all the fans of this genre must watch thispositive,Im a big Stephen King fan and I wondered if this movie would be a good adaptation. Some of Kings work has been great on film but others have not translated well. No fear. As others have noted this is an amazing film that provides inspiration and reconnects the viewer with the inner core of humanity. The script is great the directing is wonderful and the performances are unbelievably good. To give you some idea of just HOW GOOD this is the first time I saw it was on an airline. Problem was the headset didnt work and there werent any other headsets. The movie is so good that I couldnt stop watching it--and this is a movie heavy on dialogue. If youve never seen it do yourself a favor. NOTE: Its even better with the soundpositive,Im a big fan of movies that have depth and tells a great story. American movies doesnt always provide that. The Shawshank Redemption however is a prime example of what American story telling can be. With a slight non-linear build up strong and patient character development the movie drags you more and more into the despair of Andy Dufresne but always with a sense of hope. For me theres no two ways about it. This is simply the best movie ever made. 10/10.  remember this: Tolkien created LotR as a mythology and it was his aim that someone would one day re-write it and pass it down to new generations part of the mythical process and that is what Jackson has done - continued the mythical process The trilogy on the whole is awesome  a MUST seepositive,Ill start off by saying that I have loved the Lord of the Rings my whole life. Peter Jackson took Middle Earth then and turned it into a whole new experience. The first two movies which were astounding culminated in this epic ending to a great series. From the perfectly constructed Minas Tirith to the final destruction of the Ring Peter Jackson made Middle Earth come alive. While there were major deviations from the book such as the Army of the Dead fighting at Minas Tirith instead of Pelagir these are for the most part necessary and in the interest of time: any longer would be unbearable. A die hard book fan like me Ive read them six times may be slightly upset with the exclusion of certain events the movie is still astounding and will be among my most re-watched.positive,Ill keep this short and sweet. I am not the type of person who reads critique reviews and determines whether that will make me watch a movie or not. However I didnt think I would ever want to see this movie after seeing the preview and a friend said it was a bit slow. I have to honestly say that I was impressed by the directing acting and overall story. This is a great move You should defiantly take the time out of your life to see a great movie that is not a superhero remake. This story has structure purpose and meaning. Though if you cant sit still then dont bother. However I do think its time we get some culture back in our lives.positive,Ill be honest folks. This film simply blew me over. Yes it has some niggling faults but it remains HIGHLY RECOMMENDED. Ledger is mesmerizing as the Joker. A weaker actor would have hurt the film as the plot isnt airtight but you simply cant tear your eyes away from him while hes on screen. Bale takes some getting used to as Batman is completely in the Jokers shadow in this film. Its a competent performance from him. Everyone else does a reasonable job and there are no weak links in the cast. I thought Eckhart did very well with a difficult role. The last hour is slower than the preceding two but the film manages to hold your attention completely. Unlike the uplifting end of Batman Begins this film ends on a downer. Impressive 10/10positive,Ill always remember watching this film when i was younger it was one of the first films that ever gave me that mind-blowing experience you sometimes get when youve seen a brilliant movie. Tim Robbins gives what is undoubtedly for me his best performance as Andy who is such an inspiring character that you find yourself truly rooting for even in the early stages of the film. Morgan Freeman gave a stellar performance arguably his best also as Red Andys cell mate another character you grow to love during this wonderful piece of cinema. This is a film i will never tire of if you havent watched it for whatever reason you should do A solid 10/10 for me enjoy.  Pulp is a throwback to those crime cereals that were so prolific in newspapers and comic books of the 70s as well as a throwback to the classic mobster movies many of us grew up with. Some people see this as a weakness to Quentin Tarantinos direction saying that hes limited to only making homages to other things in popular culture. I dont think thats true personally but in my opinion its one of his strengths. He takes a genera that is well known and popular and gives it a very fresh twist. He did that with Pulp and he continues to do it today with films like Kill Bill and Inglourious Basterds. Boiling Pulp Fiction itself down however the true lovers of cinema the people who will know exactly what Tarantino is referencing or paying homage to are the ones who will get the most out of this film. That is however not to say that casual viewers wont like the film. It has a little something for everybody and is without a doubt one of the best films of the recent generation. I hope you like this review and take it into consideration if you decide to see the film. positive,ill admit when i first heard that marvel was doing a guardians of the galaxy movie the only thing i could think was really? in a rather disappointed tone as if marvel had lost their mind after iron man iron man 2 thor captain america the avengers yes iron man 3 thor the dark world and captain america winter soldier they green lighted a gotg movie? what were they thinking? then i saw the first trailer and it caught my interest but i still just couldnt picture it not along side the greatness of the previous marvel movies it just didnt seem like it would be a good movie to me i couldnt conceive of what possible plot they could have come up with for a move with a raccoon and a tree then i saw the fourth trailer on itunes and got rather excited from the fourth trailer i started to have hope but the big problem with having hope in a movie you know nothing about is that you can get that hope dashedquickly but i bought my ticket anyway giving marvel the benefit of the doubt after all perfect track record so far if anything it wasnt going to completely suck that much i knew first part of the movie before the marvel logo actually tugged at my heart then the part after the credits had me laughing so hard i instantly knew this was going to be a perfect movie and not a single moment of the movie disappointed me i laughed and i laughed and i was excited and i grew more excited and i laughed some more it was the best time ive had at the movies in years it has been forever since i left a theater that excited to see a movie again and i plan to see it many more times thank you marvel for giving me a new favorite moviepositive,ill admit that this jolly vanilla stuff isnt my cup of tea and everyone practically has read the script already but holy fairy godmother cinderella is fantastic acting and visual are stellar they reach the magical effect intended and also a touch of humility it literally dazzles with sheer production value until you cant help but feeling that warm fuzzy sensation of disney magic cinderella lily james is a poor orphan who is enslaved by her evil stepmother cate blanchett we all know this already the movie has a task to just retell the story consistently thankfully the great line of actors does that admirably well there will be a certain expectation on how the characters behave for the main pair lily james and her prince richard madden look fitting she has innocent ambiance albeit slightly passive on her trial its a less empowering female especially after frozen and maleficent ronda rousey wouldnt have this problem however it stays true to its root and if you want someone to look likable and good in blue dress lily james fits the bill richard madden delivers a light persona as its his duty to be charming he does it so well i didnt realize hes the same guy from a more harrowing ball of game of thrones the best has to be cate blanchett as the stepmother shes cunningly annoying shes a mix between complaining soccer mom and supervillain basically the most pg portrayal of antagonist to invoke loathing from audience but not till the point of giving them nightmare helena botham carter as fairy godmother is a rather predictable cast i didnt follow the movies hype but when the character appeared i thought that helena carter would be appropriate then there she was magic script is fancy and suave but its also not over reaching the dialogues are engaging as they are delivered with confident they sound very poise and high class without being too cheesy production value and costume are downright mythical it seems that cinderella wants gold statues for the wedding and seeing how majestic everyone and everything look it may just grasp the rewards for next year cinderellas biggest magic is its universal charm a children fairy tale that is uplifting and enjoyable for all ages thats what matters mostpositive,Ill admit Id held off on seeing the Shawshank Redemption. I remained a little apprehensivepositive,if you want a new story youll be disappointed if however you want the classic story retold in a beautiful simple way this will easily satisfy you we all know the story right? why mess with it? there are a few small additions mainly at the beginning to set the story we know and love but the majority of it is a reproduction of everything we cherish in my opinion thats a good thing my whole family thought maleficent was magnificent in the way it turned a story we knew on its side cinderella on the other hand we all loved because it embraced the classic plot without twisting it into something it is not visually the movie was incredible both my girls my wife and daughter thought everything looked exactly as they dreamed it should that is an enormous compliment probably their biggest complaint was that the trailers showed too many of the visual elements they wanted to be surprised with the unveiling of cinderellas dresses and the like other than that there was hardly any complaints go ahead and see the cinderella you know its wonderfulpositive,If you want a movie which you can watch many time this movie defiantly for you. watched this movie plenty of time and never get bored. watched this movie in 2008 First time and get felt on it. my friend not like to watch Hollywood movies but my choice are different from them. often like watching movie. movie have nice story + every character has their own important. should also watch 300 movie Im not big big fan of science fiction movies so not much like. friend this was my if you want to watch this movie you will never be disappoint so you should defiantly go for watch this movie this is my personal though.positive,If you liked this movie see True Romance written by Quentin but directed by Tony Scott What can you say about Pulp Fiction One of the finest films and most influencial A masterpiece in time study and dialogue Such real characters that it makes my head spin I hope he does another writing credit soon cause no one else writes dialogue like Quentin Its one of the best ever period  we get Guy Ritchie and Jeremy Clarkson Travolta and Samuel L Jackson play Vincent and Jules a couple of bantering hit men working for Marsellus Ving Rhames who is highly protective of his wife Mia Uma Thurman and about to conclude a payday from a fixed boxing match  Marselluss fighter Butch Bruce Willis is haunted by a childhood encounter with his late fathers best friend a jaw-dropping cameo from Christopher Walken Everyones destiny plays out with that of a couple of freaky stick-up artists played by Amanda Plummer and Tim Roth In 1994 all the talk was of former video-store clerk Tarantinos indifference to traditional culture That patronised his sophisticated cinephilia and in fact 20 years on the writerly influences of Edward Bunker Elmore Leonard and Jim Thompson seem very prominent Don DeLillo began the 90s by warning that the US is the only country in the world with funny violence Maybe Pulp Fiction was the kind of thing he had in mind Unmissablepositive,if you like previous fincher works like the game then you will thoroughly enjoy this as it is full of stylish twists and turns in the film making as someone thats not a huge affleck fan i felt he really did a good job with this role but rosamund pike steals the show with her performance the soundtrack is really well done sounding like a mix between vangelis and nine inch nails at points i believe films should be advertised purely by who directs it as a david fincher fan this film is truly damn near perfect from the subtle perversion within editing the innovative soundtrack and especially great social commentary i honestly feel this film will receive negative reviews purely for the issues it looks essentially the opposite effect of a movie like the butlerpositive,If you havent seen this yet - get off of the moon and get to the cinema This has to be one of the best films of all time. Minas Tirith. Nuff said 10/10  everybody did an excellent job with their individual flair of black comedy. The style was very familiar if you have seen Quentins earlier work. I found this movie to be completely awesome something missing from movies nowadays. Movies nowadays include a message but do not execute it the right way. Pulp Fiction though has NO message and executes it nicely. Its fun its gritty and its just over-the-top greatness. This is what I wanna expect from movies but sadly nothing can have that feeling you get when you finish Pulp Fiction. These facts combine to the fact that Pulp Fiction is one of my favorite films. It has no point  but the fact that is HAS no point puts it up there with the greatest. I had no expectations beforehand but afterword I had so much to praise. The entertainment the humor and the point. Lying before YES it has a point. But it is too obscured to find out the real meaning. I love this movie and Im sure you will too. Dont walk in with expectations  itll ruin the surprise. The surprise is the joy and fun youll get with the film. Pulp Fiction includes great acting great fun and overall great entertainment. This is by far Quentins best film... 10/10.  positive,If you havent seen it you might say Why does a batman movie have such a high rating Let me STOP YOU RIGHT THERE This is NOT A BATMAN MOVIE. This is a disturbing dark horror-like reinterpretation of batman. You could completely care less about the dark knight character and even forget about him sometimes when Heath Ledger comes on the screen as The Joker. A crazy man who paints his face and carves smiles on his victims with a razor sharp knife. Never have I ever been more impressed by any acting performance than this. Heath Ledger is the scariest creepiest craziest murderous villain in all cinematic history. No offense Christian Bale but Heath LedgerJoker is the reason this is one of the greatest movies of all time. The Joker is the reason you see a 9.0 in front of you. He is scary as f***. Twisting a childrens comic into a horror movie. I was never into comics superheros especially not Batman. This movie blew my mind. You are seriously wasting your time on this planet not watching it. Just like you are if youve never seen Its Always Sunny in Philadelphia. Its like trying apple pie you HAVE to. personally not a big fan of apple pie just used that because its a saying so replace apple pie with something you think is delicious that everyone has to try. Then add this movie to your list. If you think you dont want to watch it because you dont like super hero movies you are misled and sadly mistaken.positive,if you havent seen 2014s divergent or read veronica roths trilogy the

The script is so excellent that every word spoken sticks in your mind and later on in the movie you remember every word before it is recollected. This film makes you angry upset romantic sick and elated. It touches all of the senses and you cannot take your eyes off the screen for one minute. The cinematography is excellent and so is the research and hard work that has gone into ensuring that all of the costumes and props are of the era.positive,If this film isnt making you smile or at least listen attentively as if you were in on a private candid conversation then its knocking you on your butt flooring you with some gripping scene or perhaps a slightly confusing yet pleasing turn in editing schematic Unless of course youre my mother and are offended by the language and/or violence and stop watching I remember walking out of the theater with my friend thinking Id just seen something amazing and that Id never seen anything like it before I still remember the riveting tense feeling I had when Butch played by Bruce Willis decides to go back for his fathers gold watch at his apartment certain that gangsters like John Travoltas Vincent Vega are looking for him The long walk to his apartment through the back alleyways and yards was incredibly tense as you got the feeling the man was walking into certain death And then the moment he thinks everything is fine he decides to toast a pop tart I thought my heart was going to burst out of my chest And later still when you think everything is fine again youre floored by another predicament The only time this sort of experience works in my opinion is when you see a good movie for the first time in a theater Naturally the second time round does not produce the same kind of tension unless of course you suffer from amnesia and dont remember what happens But what Im getting at is the relationship you develop with a film in a theater versus at home on video For me Pulp Fiction is just one example of many where the experience was vastly enhanced by the cinematic environmentpositive,If there was a rating higher than ten this is the only movie in the world that deserves it. I say this with all seriousness. I loved this movie. This movie has everything anyone could ever want. Tolkien fans {I am one myself} and everyone else will not be disappointed. For the very few people left by now who havent seen this movie DO SO IMMEDIATELY :] Lord of the Rings is a beautiful work of literature and the movie comes near to matching its brilliance. In the short documentary entitled Ringers Lord of the Fans someone says that the power of Lord of The Rings is almost spiritual and I agree. Pete Jackson definitely captured the magic of the books and you dont want to miss it.positive,If someone tells me to describe a real entertaining movie - that would be it. Real for the lack of SFX is a true bless when talking about The Shawshank Redemption. I become fed up with pictures that achieve success based on the splendid job of the SFX crew or the team responsible for the CGI effects. Films purity emphasises the importance of the act. The actors are incrediblepositive,If ever a great movie has been made it must be Pulp Fiction I mean you cant even say that this THE film  its just FILM This is what movies are all about: great dialogues characters you can relate to although they are probably just as distant to your reality as eg the monsters in Bad Taste and appropriate music Its not a movie you can just turn on and watch unfocused though If you really want to enjoy it youll probably have to see it three times or more If youre not planning on doing this dont watch it Then of course theres the mystery behind Pulp Fiction Whats in the briefcase Although plausible theories have been developed well probably never know for sure Quoting the man himself Tarantino on the question Whats in the briefcase: Anything you want To be brief: I really think this is the best movie ever made positive,if boyhood came to our theater in topeka i mustve missed it ive been on a quest to see this years nominated films so janet & i finally rented boyhood on amazon prime instant video great historic effort movie i can see why hollywood insiders have nominated it for a best picture oscar i give it all 10 stars  not so much for its story there isnt much of a main point running through all 12 years but for its neverbeendonebefore achievement rent it if you get a chance  but be aware that it is rated r for a lot of profanity that said i do think that the harry potter films did something similar by casting the same 3 lead actors and some others during 8 movies over a 10 year periodpositive,If anything Pulp Fiction is great because like Atom Egoyan Tarantino doesnt see the world as linear Watching this movie I really got the idea that other events do occur even if were not involved with them This movie really has a pulse where as most movies just plod along And the plot which seems utterly confusing at first makes perfect sense at the end Which was the big problem with THE USUAL SUSPECTS where the more I knew the less I cared The film is not as violent as it first seems That has been a major issue in the movie but if you count the body count is only seven or eight And a few of those deaths are implied such as the Gimp A real treasure A movie that makes you appreciate what movie experiences are really aboutpositive,Id never heard of The Shawshank Redemption when I tuned in to it about 15 minutes in on one of my satellite channels sometime around 1997 or so. It mesmerized me and the last 20 minutes astounded me. The twists the musical  the final scene. Amazing. I recall doing some searches in those pre-Google days probably with Alta Vista to find out if anyone else had ever heard of this film. I found out that they had. It turns out a whole lot of people discovered this film as a sleeper on DVD or cable or satellite. My favorite movies of around that time seen in theaters had been Pulp Fiction and Heat. I didnt see Forrest Gump until around 2000 or so and didnt care for it much. A good year for films. Given the comments in the past half year or so that Ive gone back through I suppose Shawshank will fall below some other films. There seems to be a a trend toward making Hey its not all that That is its not all that good its lousy its overrated etc. Whatever its a great film. And when I happened to see it late one night on my satellite system I thought I was the first to realize how great it was. It took several years for me to spot the high ratings on IMDb and to read that it had become a cult classic favorite. Ditto for The Big Lebowski which for a while I thought I was the only fan of. Now its a subject of festivals and midnight watchings sort of like Rocky Horror once was. I saw Rocky Horror in 1976 at the World Science Fiction Convention in Kansas City and thought it was not very entertaining. For me the last 20-30 minutes is just the best. One twist after another all seamlessly done. And a compelling musical . Unforgettable.positive,Id heard about this film a few years ago and Id heard it was good. I was lied to. This film wasnt good It was outstanding I cant believe I never watched this sooner From the opening scenes where the mysterious Andy Dufresne is being dragged into hell to the credits as Red runs across the beach to him this film was in a word Perfect No holes to spot almost everything was completely accurate Probably some of the best script Ive ever heard and a brilliant story. Normally If a film goes over two hours I start to get a little bored and I end up wanting the film to end but this was completely the opposite I never wanted this to end and the hefty 140 minutes get you wanting more and the story drew me in so much I felt as if I was there. Normally with films adapted from Stephen King books they dont do so well on the big screen but this has proved that wrong Overall I like this film because its realistic it goes into great depth and the story is so gripping you cant take your eyes off the screen and this film will always be there at the top as one of my favourite films everpositive,Id give this movie an 11 if it were possible. The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King lives up to its extremely long title. Its a LONG movie. Once youve seen the extended edition theres no going back. Many key scenes were cut from the film. Even today the special effect hold up better than many halfassed films on the market. Epic is the one word to define this franchise. For long I have debated whether the second or the third film is the best. I cant decide. The music is beyond words. Howard Shore has crafted one of the best original s ever up there next to Star Wars. The Lord of the Rings shows Hollywood how battle scenes are done. If youve never seen this die in a hole. Long live the King.positive,i would like to start out by addressing something i find totally unfathomable the sheer volume of criticism the film has attracted here on imdb though i cannot say i am completely unsurprised by it after all this site in particular seems to bring out the worst side of people and attracts many of the negative nancys of the internet still its rather disheartening that so many people are being so dismissive of this film over trivial or even objectively incorrect perceptions of its weaknesses gone girl directed by modern cinematic mastermind david fincher is one of the most stirring mindbending and thrilling mysterydramas in years elevated thanks to finchers expert guidance and universally incredible performances from its expansive cast the film is very much the perfect modern thriller delivering enough edgeofyour seat twists to keep you enthralled and still pondering the implications of the film long after its finished ben affleck stars as nick dunne a man whose seemingly perfect marriage has been crumbling for some time culminating in the disappearance of his wife amy rosamund pike the morning of their fifth anniversary nick soon finds himself at the center of an enormous cluster of problems including the growing media circus surrounding the case uneasiness with local authorities who are trying to find amy and his own inconsistent attitude which is painting him in an increasingly suspicious light what happened to amy? is nick truly the loving husband he wants to work to believe he is or is he the sinister sociopath that media wants to paint him as? and most importantly did nick in fact kill his wife? while i cannot give too much away as to avoid spoilers i must say the casting and performances are incredible and absolutely spoton affleck knocks it out of the park as a troubled man who may not be the figure he outwardly tries to portray himself as neil patrick harris and tyler perry make for thrilling supporting roles that take you by surprise especially considering their predominately comedic backgrounds kim dickens gives a great turn as a local officer who is simultaneously one of nicks biggest assets and also one of his biggest detractors and carrie coon shines as nicks sister who serves as his moral support despite not always telling him everything he wants to hear but it is rosamund pike the titular gone girl who shines the brightest this is her film everything about her role is intriguing troubling and keeps the mystery and suspense alive in particular her journal entries which comprise the backbone of the film and also lead the audience to question whether she or her husband had their own ulterior motives in the marriage and warps the perception of the story pike deserves so much more recognition for this role because this is the role of a lifetime writing duties are handled by gillian flynn whom also wrote the novel upon which the film is based while i have not read the book and therefore refuse to compare it flynn constructs a tight concise yet also deliciously mysterious tale and some of her framing devices and artistic flourishes help elevate what could have otherwise been quite the routine film im excited to see what comes next for flynn because this film has definitely made me want to keep my eye on her work in the future director david fincher continues to prove his status as one of the great directors working today with this film as he has with previous works he soaks this film in his deliciously dark twisted sometime nihilistic visual and storytelling sensibilities and it fantastically compliments and augments the uneasiness of the story and the unsure relationship the audience has with the characters and finally there is the remarkable  by trent reznor and atticus ross my god this is one of the most unique and fascinating musical s ive heard in some time ive been increasingly interested in the duos work especially after their last collaboration with fincher on the girl with the dragon tattoo remake which i will admit i think has a slightly superior  and they once again provide the perfect audible backdrop to the visual experience of the film bravo reznor and ross gone girl is easily one of the best films of the year in my opinion its a stellar example of modern mystery and tightly assemble character drama and its a film that will haunt you long after it ends its a perfect 10positive,I work in a video store and there is something I experience every day. Although there are more and more superhero-movies out there and even more are coming up soon many people still disregard them. And one cannot really judge them for that because after all these movies are still quite special in a way. One does not only have to like action-movies but apart from that one has to suspend ones disbelieve as to accept the supernatural or superhuman maybe even more than in Science-Fiction. However regardless of whether you like superhero-movies or not or whether you like action-movies or not in my opinion there is no way around Christopher Nolans Batman Begins and his other movies for that matter and the movie this review is about: The Dark Knight. In it the masked vigilante Batman continues his struggle against crime in the fictional metropolis Gotham with the help of Police Commissioner Gordon and the new District Attorney Harvey Dent. Some time has passed since the events of Batman Begins and the struggle is going quite well. Until they have to face the mysterious and sadistic criminal mastermind called The Joker and the chaos he unleashes. The cinematography is great solemn and sublime wide shots are mixed with intensive close shots and stunning action-scenes. The colors and the light are hard and realistic and get darker and darker as the movie proceeds. As for the cast Christian Bale gives the best performance as Batman/Bruce Wayne there has been so far he is disillusioned and vulnerable and still not willing to give up. He is a mere human who has to play the role of the playboy and billionaire on the one side and a masked vigilante a symbol for hope and justice on the other. Gary Oldman underplays his part as Jim Gordon in a down-to-earth simple way. Maggie Gyllenhaal is both tough and vulnerable as Rachel Dawes lawyer and Bruce Waynes love Michael Caine plays a supporting father-figure as Bruce Waynes Butler Alfred Aaron Eckhart is both shining and charismatic as Harvey Dent and twisted and wrecked as Two-Face- the list could be continued throughout the whole cast. To them: Take a bow you have been part of this great filmpositive,I wont put any spoilers in this review  but I think everyone with a brain has already seen this or at least should want to see this movie because it is one of the greats of all time. I do think that Christian bale did do an excellent job playing my favorite super hero  batman but this obviously isnt the reason this movie is on IMDbs top 100 . Heath ledger has one of the most spectacular acting performances Ive seen in my life  I am 16 plus the plot line is amazing and well written. I typed this review mostly because I was bored but also to express my love for this movie. I have the movie at home but if it comes on TV I dont even think about passing it by. This is a movie for the history bookspositive,I wont possibly say anything new about this movie as its very professional certainly best movie of the year etc. But I want something to add - its sure one of the best movies ever made because of love of all team to Tokeins book and material. Its something you cant describe it because effects for example - yeah theyre great but you have seen them before. BUT how they are done how is acting is done soundtrack music everything - it shows that many for them - for actors artists for all team - it was Magnum Opus. Work of Life. Made with love. Best movie ever made in fantasy genre - and best movie of the year. Oh and certainly the best triology ever made period.positive,i will say that being a big fan of the animated fan i will say that the film did a rather decent job being faithful of the material but adding a few twists and spins of its own in this version it expands more upon cinderellas family family and having a chance encounter with the prince when cinderellas mother and father pass away she is left under the cruelty of lady tremaine played wonderfully by cate blanchett who makes the character rather cruel but somewhat sympathetic who wants to keep the money to her and her sleazy but dimwitted daughters anatasia and druzilla another surprise is helena bonaham carter who looks stunning as the fairy godmother lily james version of cinderella retains the kindness and strong will but manages to have a bit more backbone and courage richard madden does a decent job making the prince likable who loves cinderella for who she is overall i would say overall a great film for those of all agespositive,I will never forget this trilogyÎ Jacksons directing achievement cant be measureÎ special effects cinematography make up costume design sound  editing screenplay actors performances ... everything in its right place. Im sure lots of people all over the world feels the same about the movie. Ian McKellen is Gandalf he is not just an actor... He really became the white wizardÎ Mortensen Wood Weaving Bloom Astin Blanchette Tyler ... what a crewÎ I read the book four years ago and i just couldt believe that images from movie matched perfectly with my imagination. I wish this movie make directors and producer of Hollywood assume new challengesÎ God save the KingÎpositive,I will never forget the first time I watched The Shawshank Redemption with my father. Both of us were fans of prison and male-bonding movies and choose the film only expecting to watch a solid drama. Needless to say that when the last line was delivered and the TV screen painted the walls with a beautiful blue the feeling that we had just watched something exceptional instantly cut through our hearts and before the second viewing we would regularly mention how great that film with the poster was. Then I would never miss it whenever I found it on TV and after each viewing it unveiled one unsuspected element of its unique appeal. I guess if it doesnt justify at least it explains why this movie that didnt do well in the theaters had a better success on VHS TV and DVD before it would ultimately dethrone The Godfather from the first place on IMDb Top 250. And its only justice if The Shawshank Redemption the least spectacular of the four Best Picture nominees in the glorious 1994 made by a relatively unknown director a movie with an appeasing and appealing patience took its time to grow on people and did it pretty well as if it applied its own philosophy patiently but determinedly. This is the strength of The Shawshank Redemption its ability to tell a story that spans a long period of time without trying to get to the so-called essential the simplest things take their full meanings the smallest details have their share of importance. And think about it in a prison where everyone wears the same outfits where the days are regulated by the same routine all you can do is to make a life out of this routine make a place to get closer to your own definition of having a life. And as we penetrate the impressive walls of Shawshank from the first vertiginous panoramic shot were literally submerged by the solemn austerity of the location conveying a very hostile feel. These characteristics are perfectly incarnated by the figure of the Warden Samuel Norton whos like the male alter-ego of Nurse Ratched from One Flew Over the Cuckoos Nest. And the comparison with Formans film isnt fortuitous as Shawshank intends to domesticate its occupants to the same limits of mechanical alienation to the point that the only thing left to the inmates is to control their only valuable treasure: time by getting busy finding their own reason-to-be like the veteran Brooks James Whitmore was the man with the books Red remarkably played by Morgan Freeman was the man who could get you things. In a very intelligent move from the script the hero of the film the laconic Andy Dufresne an upper-class banker played in all nuance by Tim Robbins is condemned to a life sentence at Shawshank for the murder of his wife and her lover. And nothing indicates if he is innocent or guilty and I wondered if any certitude would have conditioned my appreciation of the character. I think it was necessary for us to have a reasonable doubt about his innocence in order to let his character progressively grow on us until we believe by ourselves that he was indeed the victim of unfortunate circumstances the same feeling that grew in the heart of Red before becoming his best friend. Morgan Freeman is the pillar of the film while Tim Robbins is its free spirit both allow us in a remarkable complementarity to dream of abstract notions like hope and freedom while being practical and busy in the same time. And again their friendship is a slow process that takes its time to progress and reaches a pivotal point when Andy was allowed to put his bankers casket again and feels that prison didnt deprive him from his social quality. Shawshank is not slow but more a patience-demanding film with a sense of decency in the way it trusts our intelligence. And the films motto on which relies its philosophical core is Get busy living or get busy dying. Now two things occur to me while writing these lines a heart-breaking sequence about the inmate Brooks who was freed after 50 years of detention and who realized he was institutionalized. A notion explained by Red: when the infamous wall that scared you so much becomes your personal guiding light while outside its all dark and your time is deconstructed. Brooks couldnt live outside Shawshank so there was no other way he could live. The second thing is the sad passing of Steve Jobs today. And as I was reading his famous Stanford speech I couldnt help but make a connection with the beautiful message of Darabonts film an invitation to dream to escape from any sort of walls or obstacles put in your life and heart with as many dreams as you can fulfill a notion illustrated by the beautiful scene when Andy put some classical music on the microphone so the prisoners could for once elevate themselves and having an ephemeral moment of pure freedom this is the triumph of human spirit this understanding of the value of life is The Shawshank Redemption In the same vein than One Flew Over the Cuckoos Nest Shawshank is a constant encouragement to fight the system and use time for the best for whatever constitutes our dreams being men again able to enjoy to feel to give a meaning to our lives. In other words hope hope that things can get better despite the adversity. To quote Steve Jobs : Courage is the discovery that you may not win and trying when you know you can lose. This is the true intelligence of life what makes it worth living. The Shawshank Redemption a powerful adaptation of Stephen Kings novel is one of the greatest American films: a powerful story of courage perseverance hope and ultimately friendship and humanity.positive,I will keep this short Pulp Fiction has amazing characters played by fantastic actors like John Travolta Uma Thurman Bruce Willis Christopher Walken and of course the most badass man on the planet Samuel L Jackson This is a movie I compare to Snatch and Lock Stock and two smoking barrels those movies are great but nothing compared to Pulp Fiction It has a great and entertaining story and is a true classic It is Quentin Tarantinos best movie and that says a lot It has great action scenes and funny lines some quotes from this movie will i remember for the rest of my life If i summarize it I can say that it is a funny good written good action scenes good quotes and fantastic actors I recommend this highly It is way better than The Godfather and The shawshank redemption it deserves to be on top It also deserved to win an Oscar although Forrest Gump was good this is betterpositive,i went to watch this film not knowing much about the background of the story or what it was exactly about it started off well although in my opinion it did drag on for a long period of time before they actually ended up in space this does not effect the film though or my rating one bit as it all worked out in the end and the build up was necessary the special effects in this film are awesome and are used in a way which i was literally at the edge of my seat in shear anticipation suspense and a slight sense of nervousness its very tense in many parts and it certainly keeps you thinking i dont know how people in the right state of mind can give this film a 1 star or say disappointing rubbish stick to batman nolan these people dont know what they are talking about and are just trying to be picky and find a way to make the film look bad its a brilliant film something suitable for all the family definitely a film for everyone one of the best movies everpositive,I went to the cinema last night...and WOW Ive got to read the books again some day third time. Cant wait for the directors cut version :- If you havent seen it yet...then WHAT ARE YOU DOINGpositive,i went into this movie with a high standard because of all of the movies nominations and awards that critics have approved as a deserving addition to this movies accomplishments i also had skeptics on the plot as it was considered to be basic and that nothing really happens but where it hit me most was at the end where i could look back on these chapters of this kids life that made it interesting and worth wild to have all these experiences that a normal kid should have of course since the title of the movie is boyhood it focuses mainly on the boys early life but i feel that a diverse audience can find something relatable stir up some emotions as supporting characters effect and intertwine with the boy the dialog also adds to the realistic downtoearth atmosphere that the audience can immerse in and feel comfortable in though this movie neither focuses on really though times in the boys life or even the greatest of his childhood it shows how important the present moment is and to be able to look back on a memory and enjoy the life you have overall this movie was something i thought about for a while if a movie can do that and sort of change me personally i believe this to be worthy of its acclaimed recognitionpositive,i went into this film with high hopes i was not disappointed the cast was spot on coming from an old reader of the comic series they introduced the kree to the marvel comics universe finally and every single one of the actors cast as the guardians was spot on i am a casual fan of professional wrestling and i am not a fan of dave bautista i understand that most professional wrestlers are excellent actors but didnt expect much of bautista as drax the destroyer instead bautista acted out his role to perfection as did every one else in the film i honestly wasnt expecting much from rocket raccoon considering hes entirely cgi or groot instead rocket was voiced to perfection and amusing and groot stole the show there was a great mixture of emotion action and campy humor to make this film an icon in the marvel cinematic repertoire the cheesy 70s and 80s soundtrack made the film so much better for which i commend director james gunnpositive,I watched this yet again at the weekend and it remains my favourite film one that somehow continues to get better with every viewing Tarantinos witty and lurid script is delivered spot-on by actors that seem to have been born to play their parts most impressive being Samuel L Jacksons bible-quoting hitman and Bruce Willis honourable boxer Willis usually ups the ante when hes in good company and in this film the company doesnt get much better Each character has their own classic scene even the cameos Christopher Walkens in particular and each scene seems better than the last Even when you know whats coming youre looking forward to it with relish Add a superb soundtrack that compliments the films retro feel and theres not much negative to say Even the beefy running time doesnt detract from the fun Its not a movie youll be wanting to watch with your mother as the tongue-in-cheek comedy is as black as it could possibly be but its brash enthusiastic film-making that cant be ignored or - up to now at least - betteredpositive,I watched this movie for the umpteenth time probably last Sunday and how much I loved it yet again A movie I would never ever get bored of and definitely one of my all time favorites. A simple yet wonderful story about HOPE HOPE Š—– One word that drives all of us and gives us reason to live. We push ourselves through our mundane lives in the hope of achieving / finding something that we dream of. In the words of this movies protagonist Š—– hope is a good thing maybe the best of things and no good thing ever dies Superlative performances by Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman. A must watch if you havent  Sm’©agol is continuing with his plan to lure Frodo and Sam to their doom in Shelobs lair and Gandalf Aragorn Legolas and Gimli are reunited with Merry and Pippin at Isengard. When Pippin looks into the palant’_r a sort of dark crystal ball he sees the city of Minas Tirith under attack unfortunately he himself is seen by Sauron. Galdalf takes him to Minas Tirith when he rides there to warn of the impending attack while the others remain behind to raise an army large enough to assist in that coming battle. I thought that the battle of Helms Deep was impressive but it seems a mere skirmish compared to the battle of Minas Tirith here there are thousands of Orcs supported by mercenaries mounted on gigantic elephant like creatures that are large enough to crush a man and his horse under their giant feet. All the time this battle rages Frodo and Sam are journeying deeper and deeper into the land of Mordor to Mount Doom in order to end Saurons reign once and for all. This is probably the best film of the trilogy I can see why it raked in the awards the only weakness was the epilogue once the quest was completed the film could have ended at the crowning of the king rather than going on to their return to the Shire... even though Im aware that this was in the book. Peter Jackson did a fantastic job bringing such an epic story to the screen he was of course assisted by a fantastic cast who really brought the characters to life. positive,i wasnt expecting the twist on the sleeping beauty story the villain is actually the likable character in this plot i actually found that really interesting the witch wasnt the bad guy this time we at least got to understand the reason for her actions i almost never thought of the possibility that the witchs action was as a result of hurt the classic tales always makes it look like the witch placed the curse just because of the fact that she was evil well that was a nice plot twist i found the dramatic performance and the dialogue very theatrical almost like a stage play which made it really exciting the way the camera focused on jolies face was actually really cool i liked the effects in the movie not too much but just enough to make it excitingpositive,I was still in high-school and first LOTR:FOTR came out. I watched posters all over the place on the bus stop in subways and everywhere. I went to watch a movie and saw the trailer. it has very ancient type look and has no interesting feelings. The only part that looked very surprising was the end of the trailers with humongous army. Then one day i was surfing the web and hit the download link on Kazza if people may know what Kazza was at that time. AFter few hour the download was complete. So i sat on the chair in front of the 15 inch computer screen with video size of iphone screen 600*400. After more than three hours my mind was lost in that small screen. I could not believe what i saw. I was a spectacle of life. A sheer journey to the land of fantasy warriors and elves  I kind of fell in love with Arwen at that time. Then i realized that some how the end was not complete. It stuck in my mind for few days then started surfing the web again. Eventually i found out that it was the first part of the trilogy. And after 10 years its is still the best movie ever made. The movie rewrote the scale ad scope of making movies. I hope The hobbit turns out to be of similar calibre.positive,I was reluctant to see this movie - thought it was just another prison movie - and I was certainly tired of mindless violence. I was channel surfing one evening - and stumbled across this movie. I watched a few minutes thinking I would change channels at the first commercial. Almost 2 hours later - after seeing the end - I sat there...saying Wow. That was a great movie. I have since recommended it to friends and family...it has grown in popularity due to word of mouth - and certainly deserves its spot at the top. Morgan Freeman put on a masterful performance as did Tim Robbins. The way their friendship develops and the interplay with the other inmates - a wonderful story. If you have not watched this movie yet - put preconceived notions aside sit down and enjoy the journeypositive,I was reading some of these posts and decided to put in my two cents worth on the Pulp debate. Someone stated that they had just seen the movie in 1999 five years after its release and could not understand the hype. Well therein lies the greatest problem facing a film like Pulp Fiction: everything novel and unique it brought to the cinema five years ago has been utterly ransacked by the Hollywood mainstream. Anyone who saw a film like Bonnie & Clyde 30 years ago will say what an impact the film made on them when today it seems only like a well constructed gangster film. Pulp Fiction already seems a little dated because we keep seeing these characters and situations appearing on film. Sure some of what Tarantino did had been done before. Wed seen rampant drug use in Drugstore Cowboy and gangster black comedy in Goodfellas but Tarantino successfully mixed the dark subject matter with hipness for the nineties and thusly created the film and the film revolution that true film lovers had been waiting years for. Pulp Fiction trampled the Hollywood blockbuster industry remember this was the year of Forrest Gump and sent studios running to Sundance to find the next big thing. People who look at Pulp Fiction years after its release are going to have the same reaction one would have after listening to say Nirvanas Nevermind: Its good but I dont get the fuss. Of course you dont. You have to be there from the beginning to realize just how much of an impact these artists had on EVERYTHING we see and hear today. People who call Pulp Fiction the greatest film of all time are probably in need of an introduction to a few more films. Pulp Fiction is not the greatest film ever made. It is however the most important film of our generation.positive,I was overwhelmed by this film. I felt like an evil little wormtongue when I saw the amazing battles and the amazing EVERY thing. I cried like a little baby throughout the entire film. The energy IS splendid for this film. This movie does it for me. I have to say that the Lord of the Rings trilogy to me is what the Star Wars trilogy is to my parents. I am proud to say look at this amazing epic in my generation. This is a giant step in the right direction for epic movie making. On a scale of 1-10 I give it a 15. Mad crazy and awesome. Great job crew and cast of LORD OF THE RINGS.positive,I was literally HOOKED. No wonder this film is rated amongst the best ever. This is definitely one of the best movies you will see your entire life. Morgan Freemans narration was awesome. Tim Robbins powerfully illustrates the importance of HOPE. All the characters did a superb job. This is surely one of my all time favourite movies. Its a classic & a true masterpiece of cinema... Dont think Just watch & savour it. I saw the following comment by someone and thought of adding it to mine I agree 100% to everything of the following: Many people in this world are unhappy. Most people in this world dont want to be unhappy. Lots of people wish pray and above all hope for that magic wand to wave and wash them of their fears losses angers and pains once and for all. They see lots of other people seemingly in this magical state while they suffer. To borrow the words of another film theyre watching the bluebirds flying over the rainbow. Many unhappy people have learned that the magic wand doesnt exist. Theyre not destined to join the bluebirds and fairy tales dont come true. Its not that no one lives happily ever after its just that theyre not going to. Theyre busy dying. In this film or as some people have quite correctly said this fairytale magic wands exist. And that magic wand is Andy Dufrense imitating Houdini. However this film is not about him. Neither is it about the prison the governor the guard the plot the acting the cinematography the script the direction or the . Its about Red. He is the one who has become institutionally unhappy hes not only trapped in a prison not only has he given up on the idea of ever leaving not only does he have no hope he knows that if the miracle would ever happen to him he couldnt cope. Hes safe in his unhappiness and that security is what keeps him going. Hope is as Red say dangerous. The metaphor for a certain illness here is very clear to me and I know that a rather large number of people suffer from it. A large proportion of those dont understand whats wrong but they certainly can recognise a fellow sufferer. Those who are mercifully untouched by this illness definitely dont understand whats going on in those who do. Theyre too busy living. Just a little piece of advice to everyone who hated/disliked this film  . A thousand kisses and million thanks for you. A VERY MUST SEE A GREATEST CINEMAs HISTORY EVENT... positive,I was incredibly happy with the way Peter Jackson did the last installment of Lord of the Rings. He kept all the major plot occurences from the book and transformed them into a visual presentation of the book The ending was so parallel to the boo kthat it had near the same affect of instilling emotion into me as the book did. Therefore I think that RoTK is one of the best movies this year and in the history of filmmaking.positive,I was blown away when I first saw the Dark knight. It is better then Batman Begins and is one of my most favorite movies. I am glad Heath Ledger was nominated but The Dark knight should have been nominated for best picture. Heath Ledger was very capable at playing the joker. I like the scene where he killed the gangster with a pencil. Aaron Eckhart was great at playing Two-Face and did better then Tommy Lee Jones did in Batman Forever. He was evil but I felt bad for him. I liked the hospital confrontation between the joker where he used his coin and spared jokers life. Theres only one bad part of Dark Knight. I liked the final battle between Batman and the joker but after he was captured for good they did not show him in Arkham Asylum. I think Maggie Gyllenhall did better than Katie Holmes and I liked her scene with the Joker. Christian Bale gave an Oscar worthy performance and he had improved since Batman Begins. I also liked when Lucius Fox referenced Catwoman. I cant wait to see The Dark Knight Rises. I am kind of glad that Bane is one of the villains. Hes not that well known but he is famous for breaking the bat. If Heath Ledger had not died he would have been in Dark Knight Rises. He would have teamed with Bane. Everyone should see The Dark Knight because it is an excellent film.positive,I was at the video store with my girlfriend and we wanted to rent out a few movies. I decided that one of the films we should rent out is The Shawshank Redemption. I had always wondered why it had such good ratings as well as being positioned at #2 in the IMDb Top 250 and I thought I would see just how good the movie really was. When the film concluded in a way that I would have never conceded I sat there in front of the TV surprised and dumbfounded. When my girlfriend asked me what was wrong I simply just said That....is the greatest movie I have ever seen in my entire life. It was not just an ordinary and clich’©d film I was watching it was art on the screen 2 and a half hours of extraordinary cinematography unforgettable acting and a plot so compelling that you just did not want it to end. Morgan Freeman as Red and Tim Robbins as Andy are the perfect choices for their respective roles. The prison setting is so daunting and visually satisfying while the corruption by the warden and the guards is dreadfully brutal yet extraordinarily eye popping. I normally dislike some movies that normally go for over 2 hours as I think they are just dragging on but Shawshank along with very few others kept me glued to the screen in suspense. I hung onto every scene and every word uttered in the entire film. The Shawshank Redemption is unique in its own little way and it has affirmed my belief that hope and courage through adversity is possible and rewarding. Not many movies are made like this and I just hope that there is a movie like but probably not as good as The Shawshank Redemption that will be made in this hostile and cruel 21st Century. Movies like this really change lives. 10/10positive,i was a little apprehensive to see this movie as i pegged it for a chick flick it was a date night with my girlfriend and usually im bored by these kinds of movies however i was pleasantly surprised at how captivating the movie was i felt the pace in the beginning was a bit slow though and these folks talking about oh i saw the trailer so i knew what was going to happen are idiotic of course youve seen the movie the cinderella story has been around for twice to three times our own lifetimes if not more in many cultures out there *******potential spoilers************ i think the the screenplay actors and actresss casting and the slight differences made this a kids movie for adults we grew up watching these movies as children in some capacity so therefor myself and my girlfriend had a bit of nostalgia while not having to watch a cartoon per say i did say in a joking manner if they dont have the singing mice ill be very disappointed although they didnt exactly have that they defiantly nailed it very tastefully throughout with her creature companions the one thing that does get me about this version is i wish they could have somehow rewritten was the fact her very loving father who only wanted the best for his daughter somehow married an evil stepmother then left her to fend for herself while he was away i know the writing cant always take off down that road as it would be hard to bring it back to the title person in the movie the evil stepmother showed up evil had evil daughters how could cinderellas father not see these people are awful? i feel as though he should have maybe had some similar ties like the prince to potentially be forced to marry the evil stepmother in an attempt to make his fortunes or business stronger in the end the strings i feel are tied up and the movie is brought back to its center stronghold of love kindness and forgivenesspositive,i walked into this movie expecting something magical from director richard linklater and he did not disappoint at no point did the aging process seem gimmicky it flowed with each year of his life being one heartfelt episode after another while i expected there to be some giant emotional scene one scene that would be sure to make everyone in the theater weep im almost glad i didnt get it while there were some sweet scenes that i wont get into i liked this fully honest tale of growing into oneself with genius writing and wondrous acting especially from the leads coltrane and arquette with the latter i expect a best supporting actress nomination this should go down as a film along the lines of many other great comingofage films that everyone young and old should experience at least once in their lifetimepositive,I used to like action movies more than anything else. I watched Shawshank Redemption in 2007. When I watched it for the first time I did not know that it is a great movie. When I watched it for the second time I felt that it should be one of the greatest movies. For the first time checked IMDbs top 250 movies and I amazed to see Shawshank Redemption at number two anyway its number one at present. The performances of all the artists are excellent. Not a single character is waste. Especially Tim Robins excels as Andy Dufresne. Narration by Morgan Freeman is sensational. The scenes between Morgan Freeman and Tim Robins are by far the best. The ending is one of best surprises I have seen in movies. This movie should have got the Ascar. I give 10 out of 10 for this phenomenal movie.positive,I used to leave a theatre after seeing a highly anticipated movie specifically a sequel and be so revved up about what I saw that I would declare that movie to be the best of a series. After each of the prequel Star Wars films I rated that one the best as good as any of the originals...for a time until my opinion balanced out and I had a more well-rounded take. For that reason I steer away from that mindset and did for Dark Knight. Though my opinion is solidifying already after having seen a Warner Bros. screening last night Dark Knight ably stands on its own with or without Batman Begins. At a two and a half hour runtime its definitely an epic of a movie but one that never runs out of gas. A delightful addition to this experience was a healthy amount of IMAX footage which significantly adds to the feel of being on a personal and gruesome tour of Gotham City. Christian Bale plays such a well rounded Batman and Bruce Wayne qualities that none of those who have donned the cowl before him have pulled off. I still have to remember that Bale is British since he speaks with such a spot on American accent. Bale has a particular slurring lisp that serves him quite well charmingly for Bruce Wayne and threateningly for Batman. Countering him is the late Heath Ledger who plays such a scary and creepy Joker that I found it impossible to NOT have chills half the time I saw him on screen. What really separates this brand of Joker from Jack Nicholsons portrayal is true unpredictability. Its obvious that to be a good guy and think like the Joker it really takes a toll and it sure isnt easy. How exactly does one take him down when hes woven his harebrained plot around multiple hostages explosives or disappearing parlor tricks Initially I was uneasy about how the character of Harvey Dent would be handled. In my mind there was really only one faithful portrayal of him and that could be found in the Batman animated series of the early 90s. As well as Tommy Lee Jones COULD have handled him in Batman Forever he certainly did not though it still was a highlight of that movie. Aaron Eckhart ably assumes the mantle here delivering a performance out of this world easily on par with the Batman animated series. Be it known this caped avenger stands for the good of Gotham City that the police force and its counterparts cant represent the good that has no jurisdiction no procedures...and no rules save for one. I can only hope that weve seen just the prelude to the Dark Knights upcoming legendary battles with the worst of Gotham Citys dark underside. The Dark Knight gets a solid 10 of 10 stars.positive,I totally adored the concept of hope in this film. I love how the director portrays the Shawshank tyrants as corrupt murderers thats pretty much what they are and serve as the grounds for the escape of Andy. Now Morgan Freemans got talent I love that guy he may not be the greatest out there but he is a force to be reckoned with on the set. I loved how he gave the story flavor with his descriptions of characters and perceptions of how life was in lonely jail cells of Shawshank. You know theres a lot more to say about this movie its too good too be true. Especially the ending which by the way brought tears to eyes the most moving scene Overall it was superb and all thanks to Stephen King for putting this in the form of alphabets in the first place. Im starting to regret not reading any of his novels. And kudos to the director for even coming up with such an idea for a movie.positive,i took my daughter to see this film yesterday and we both absolutely loved it angelina jolie is perfect in the role she is quite stunning in real life but with the contact lenses and cheek bones added she looks incredible and acts the part of maleficent amazingly well the updated storyline of why maleficent curses aurora from the original disney film shooting it as a prequel is feasible and quite understandable when you watch this film lana del reys voice for the song title is also beautiful and haunting i cant stop playing the theme tune i shall be taking a friend to see the film again a fantastic fantasy film and stay to the credits at the end to hear the songpositive,I thought this was probably the last one Ill see. I really liked this one I recommend it I just think they are never going to be the same after this one because of Heath Ledgers late passing. I really appreciate the acting selection. I have seen every batman up until this point excluding some of the cartoons and I believe that my kids will watch this I just think they are getting too dark these day so I actually walked out of the last one. I can kind of see me going back I had some beer before I entered into the theater so perhaps that just made me sleepy but overall I think this on the one before the one I walked out on was pretty good. Nice job. Thumbs up to the casting director. Real big thumbs up therepositive,I thought the movie was the best one. The graphics were awesome as well and the acting too. My fav part in the movie was the fighting part near the end when Aragorn got all the ghosts to help fight that was really cool.positive,I thought Batman Begins was a very well conceived and put together movie. We finally get Batman as a fully rendered character. We gain new insight into his motivations and the variables he must contend with in his role as protector of Gotham. We get to see Gary Oldman as an honest-to-goodness good guy. And we get to see Liam Neeson conducting perhaps his strangest facial hair experiment yet. But after seeing The Dark Knight Batman Begins will forevermore be viewed by me at least as a handy little prologue to a FRICKIN MASTERPIECE of a superhero film. To say its the deepest mainstream comic adaptation ever produced would be akin to calling the Nolan/Ledger Joker a bit eccentric. While watching it I found myself thinking it was very long which is usually a sign that its TOO long and therefore boring. But thats not actually the case here. The script is bulging with ideas philosophical musings THEMES which Christopher Nolan is not content to gloss over in favour of cool set-pieces as many comic adaptations are but wants to explore wants to allow the characters to explore at a logical pace. So what I guess Im saying is considering what it sets out to do the movie is long ENOUGH while still constantly holding the viewers interest. And thats not to say the thematic exploration comes at the EXPENSE of big action either. On the contrary there is some truly awesome stuff going on here. The chase with the truck for example is fantastic and theres some great hand-to-hand stuff too. But what engages us most is the characters and while the script is brilliant the dialogue is sharp and quite funny for the first two-thirds before the drama really kicks in this mainly comes down to the cast. Christian Bale. Taller than Michael Keaton was. More menacing than Val Kilmer was. Less like Adam West than George Clooney was. Solid and committed as always. He gives the character LIFE and actually makes us feel for him. The word tortured keeps coming to mind...and I suppose its pretty appropriate. Heath Ledger. Yknow Id heard talk of an Oscar nomination and thought it sounded a bit dubious. A Batman villain Winning an Oscar Is that what its come to Then I thought is it because he didnt get one for Brokeback Or more dubious still...is it because he...died But...well...how can I put it... It seems a bit blasphemous to compare Jack Nicholson to Cesar Romero but after seeing Heath at work...Jack who once seemed so awesome just looks...well...lame. If youve seen it you hopefully get what I mean. If you havent...you need to. You will discover the true definition of commitment. Maggie Gyllenhaal. I didnt have any problem with Katie in the first one at the time but I doubt she could have pulled off the more emotional stuff Rachel goes through here. Seeing recasting was necessary does Tom have a problem with his wife being involved with Batman Too many bad memories perhaps Why am I even talking about such garbage here they could have done a butt-load worse than Maggie. She rocks. As does Aaron Eckhart. But Im not giving ANYTHING away. Suffice it to say my mind was blown...AGAIN. Makes Tommy Lee Jones look like...you get the idea. Michael Caine. Still one of my favourite actors. Alfred is the shiz. Morgan Freeman. Morgan Freeman. AOK. Gary Oldman. As in BB no mania. No psychosis. No nervous tics. Absolute subtlety. Manages to hold his own alongside Christian Heath and Aaron without resorting to parlour tricks. Sign of spectacular talent. Go Gaz. Eric Roberts William Fichtner Michael Jai White Tiny Lister The whole thing is just a big bag of thoughtful well-executed entertainment. Its equal parts cerebral and visceral. Ideas and action. Ive liked every Batman movie so far okay besides Batman & Robin but this one makes them all look pretty bloody ordinary.positive,I think this movie is the best It had the best special effects Ive ever seen also the best actors who played their role really well. It also had a great background music which I totally loved. This movie really deserved all the Oscars they have won : All the scenes in the movie made a great representation of Tolkiens stories. I definitely was captured all the landscapes in the movie New Zealand rules If people havent seen it they should because its really entertaining. By now Ive seen it like 20 times or so. The dialogue in the movie are really complex which made me think a little at least for me its good. Everyone must at least see one of the 3 because they all are great.  he dares to go the next step in filmmaking and wins the audience over. Due to the extreme amount of violence drugs language and sexuality I strongly advise the faint-hearted and children to keep way away from this movie. Otherwise if you dont mind a bit of naughty fun and a huge exciting spark in your movie-life then see this now Pulp Fiction is definitely an experience you wont forget easily. positive,i think this movie is great special but not for the story or the characters some people thought its a biography or an emotional movie  well this movie is not so they came disappointed talking about how this movie is boring if you want to see a sweet movie that you can enjoy and go on you will hate this movie richard linklater didt take 12 years to make movies like the fault in our stars he have something to say about the meaning of life real life not fake one and how people deal with it so this movie about the philosophy of life you see people growing up in 12 years they are normal people so you suppose to think about your childhood there are some keys in the script to catch the idea before the end mom patricia arquette looks back and discovers that her life came to end her two child left the house and now she is lonely in a small flat she cries and says i thought it would be more people who hate this movie thought that would be more in a 12 years making movie but in the real life nothing actually happens you just grow up fast and you never seize the moment at the last scene mason meets a girl in his first day of collage she told him that people say seize the moment are wrong  i am thinking its the other way around you know like the moment seizes us mason agreed with this every one who love this movie will catch this  it is the mean massage of the movie dont regret about your sh*t life because the moment it is just  it is like its always right now now you suppose to understand this movie if you say its waste of time and nothing is happen well go and watch twilight saga i bet that is your favorite type if you get the idea of this movie you keep watching it more and more and every time you will remember your life there is a waste of time to search a meaning for how many years or what success you achieved or not because in real life there nothing happens except living  you live each moment and each moment seizes you while you are looking to seize the momentpositive,I think they did a good job with the last movie. Often with in movie series the quality just sinks with each movie that comes out but with Lord of the Rings i really think they found a way to avoid that. I am a huge fan of the books and the films really was a good surprise where movie adaption of books usually disappoints i was really surprised. Everything was just great not only with this movie but with all of them. Music locations actors and dialog. Peter Jackson is a world class director and with these movies i really feels that he shows that. Everything was great. Recommend to check out the movies and would encourage everyone to try the books.positive,I think the Return of the King was the best ending. The acting was great and the special effects were spectacular. It was smart of Peter Jackson to do the trilogy during an era when motion picture technology involved computers. Without computers it would have been difficult to make this trilogy. I enjoyed the superb acting of Orlando Bloom as Legolas John Rhys-Davies as Gimli Ian McKellen for Gandalf and Viggo Mortensen for Aragorn. The four hobbits were performed by great actors. The battle in the Pelennor Fields and Minas Tirith was the best fight sequence I have ever seen in a motion picture. It defeats Star Wars and the Matrix combined. The battle seen is the victor of the movies since its beginning. Arwen had little importance but focusing on one hobbit named Frodo is not good for attention grabbing. The alternation of scenes was the best way to keep the audience up. Arwen was important to the last installment because it shows her love for Aragorn. The ending could have been shorter but overall the film has little errors and more achievements.positive,I think The Dark Knight is greatest film of all time .It is my all time favorite film. Dark knight is not only considered as the best comic adaptation but also greatest film of time . Christian bale has done a beautiful job as batman/Bruce Wayne.He is charismaticfearless and driven. He is the hero Gotham deserves . When it comes to bad guys  heath ledger portrayal as joker is psychoticscary and mind blowingRIP heath ledger.Best joker performance in cinema history. Aaron Eckhart has done a great job as Harvey dent/two face. Gary old man returns as James Gordon . Nolan has done a great job.Just the right amount action suspensethrillcomedy and drama . I love the way Nolan has symbolized both character.Batman stands for justice and order and the other hand we have joker stands for madness and chaos.And the war between them is just EPIC.... THANK YOU NOLAN.positive,I think the big question...or the question everyone actually cares about is this: Is Christopher Nolans follow up to the critically acclaimed 2005 film Batman Begins The Dark Knight as good as everyone is saying Quite simply yes yes it is. There is no doubt about it one of the most anticipated movies of the 21st century duly deserves every amount of praise lavished onto it. This is no ordinary superhero movie this is a character and dialogue driven piece not as action orientated as you might expect. I will not go into plot details because there is a lot of it. However a basic one sentence summary is: Batman now has to face his most cunning and psychotic enemy someone with no real motives...The Joker. Now that that is out of the way I will start off with the actors and boy is there a lot to talk about. Christian Bale has done a tremendous job as our beloved Caped Crusader with him already blowing everyone else out of water with Batman Begins. Bruce Wayne has a flawed personality that hangs on the balance between righteousness and criminal. His perception of justice causes an emotional and personal shift whether he is a wealthy businessman who fights crime in a gadget-riddled suit or just a normal man who is sick of all the scum in Gotham City and decides to give the law-breakers a dose of their own medicine. Because of this and Bales tremendous acting Bruce Wayne is justified and we emphasise with Bales flawed hero more than any of the other actors. If there ever was an excellent Batman this is it. The theme of right and wrong is played well with his character here. Of course I am sure you all want know if Heath Ledger was that good. And I can safely say that he most definitely was. Ledgers Joker is not only the best but is now the greatest superhero film villain ever. His performance is truly terrifying chilling brilliantpositive,I think that this movie was very interesting. I also think that it is a very good movie. A movie for the family. I enjoyed the movie very much. I enjoyed every part of it. I believe the actor that plays The Dark Knight did a wonderful job. I dont think anyone could have done better. I recommend this movie. I recommend it for familys and everyone else as long as you are 13 and up. I hope anyone and/or everyone who watches this movie enjoys it as much as I did. I enjoyed The Dark Knight because it was interesting and well written and directed. I look forward to a sequel. In conclusion I enjoyed The Dark Knight very much and I would recommend it to you.positive,I think that I might have ruined this movie for myself I watched this movie over and over ad nauseum in my 20s I think that parts of it are dated and should remain in the 90s vault but I think that for the most part this movie is transcendent For anyone whos ever read my other comments youll know that my idea of a masterpiece is a movie that pulsates with a mystical otherworldly vibe and Id have to say that most of this movie is like that This movie has been parodied by the likes of The Simpsons and been referenced by serious critics and for good reason This movie definitely resonates with the archetypal sophomore vibepositive,I think that almost everything that can be said about this trilogy has been said already but still I will try. There are so many films that destroyed the beauty and perfection of the novels they have been built upon not this one. In front of an amazingly beautiful scenery Peter Jackson was able to create a fantasy-movie which unlike so many others before did not deal with old clich’©s and thus is far away from any trash-movie a lot of people had expected it to be beforehand. Although I am sure that the cast of this film will soon be forgotten The The Lord of the Rings-trilogy will stand the times and be one of the most renowned pictures of the las decade.positive,I think Pulp Fiction is the geatest gangster movie of all time I like mob films but this is the best in History It is extremley bloody films I think that Samuel Jackson Bruce Willis and Travolta have acted their best in the film I am big fan of this film and I would put it in the top 3 of my favourite My Favorite part is where Jules shoots Bret in the Arm that part is actually quite funny I would definitely rate this as a ten if there was a rating over ten it would go to the top I think the 3 actors and Quentin Tarantino a adding part of the moviepositive,I think my fan-boy mode has just kicked in. There are just so many good things about this movie I just... oh my god excuse me... I need a moment. The acting is excellent with the best performance coming from Heath Ledger the story is great the characters and the way they are portrayed are wonderful Batman is most definitely my favorite fictional character of all time as well as my favorite superhero. The morals of this movie are also really great and very thought provoking. It really makes us question ourselves and society as we know it. The whole thing about Batman being the Dark Knight as opposed to Harveys white knight is incredible and serves as the basis of why I love batman so much. As a comic book fan I think that it was incredible faithful to the source material which is mainly the comic book The Long Halloween but it also has influences from The Killing Joke which is one of my favorite comic book stories. All in all I think The Dark Knight is an excellent film and deserved those Oscars. 9.5 to 10 out of 10 for me.positive,I think is safe to say that this is one of the masterpieces of cinema that the industry was missing. This movie has everything unbelievable performances amazing photography and a really deep connection to every character everybody has a meaning from Bruce Wayne to the swat officers everybody has a meaning this is by far my favorite movie ever. The scrip is almost perfect from start to finish is entertaining and you start to grow a lot of emotions towards all the characters this movie is a trip into a lot of emotional feelings from joy to sympathy and ending in hope. Is impossible not to talk about the eternal Heath in this movie this is one of the best performances that I have ever seen in a movie specifically in a villain theres memorable villains in cinema history but Heath gives a performance that remind us every one of them Heaths Joker has a little of the sadism of Norman Stansfield Leon 1994 the cold blood of John Doe Se7en 1995 and the dark humor of Tyler Durden Fight Club 1999 but creating a very original and even darker and scarier villain which is impressive and absolutely difficult for a PG13 rated movie he absolutely deserved every award given to him not because of the hype of his death but because of the quality of his work this was his masterpiece. But even though he had the perfect chemistry with the other characters he was the perfect antagonist for Christian Bales Bruce Wayne which was an impressive performance Alfred Dent Gordon Fox and Dawes were also fantastic and they were perfect for each other. Is safe to say that this is a masterpiece and is going to be hard work to surpass the quality of this film.  real art that inspires you to look at the deeper aspects of life and the world around you. The Shawshank Redemption delivers much-needed breath of fresh air for anyone who realizes the capability of film. It proves that masters of the craft still live on this earth and still bless us with timeless masterpieces that we will never forget.These artists show their capability to produce art  real art that inspires you to look at the deeper aspects of life and the world around you...positive,I think film is the most successful in the entire series. I dont want to say much about it because whatever is said cannot do it justice there is enough hype surrounding its release but its there for a reason. Top Notch film. Bravo to Nolan and his crew for giving a movie that Batman truly deserves. The action is great and the plot is more deeper and engrossing. I applaud Christopher Nolan Christian Bale and especially Heath Ledger who sadly passed away earlier this year and all those aboard for believing in Mr. Nolans talents for this second installment. Although some may feel a bit of melancholy over Ledgers death but as a final note I will say this sincerely from my heart: Remember Heath Ledger and honor him in your minds and hearts not only for his performances but as a human being and father to his daughter Matilda Ledger. May we issue him best wishes for his family and friends and his daughter for years to come.positive,I suppose that someone sometime may tell the story more accurately but I doubt very much that it will ever be told better. Nothing could ever replace the books for pure escapism but Peter Jackson has managed to evoke both the feel and texture of Tolkiens masterwork without pandering too much to clich’©d Hollywood extravagance. The cast are superb if Sir Ian Mckellen is remembered for nothing else other than Gandalf I feel sure he would not complain the cinematography stunning and the pace even over the 8/9 hours for the whole trilogy is matchless. For those who have read the books as I have for many years I would suggest watching once to get all of the niggling storyline changes/omissions out of your system then just watch as a pure wonderous unadulterated piece of epic EPIC cinema. Im sure I will love it forever.positive,I still remember the first time that I watched this movie. I expected going into watching the LOTR trilogy for some kind of nerd fest full of terrible acting and cringe inducing action scenes. Instead what I got was probably my favorite film trilogy of all time. Everything truly spoke to me. Every part of these movies I have loved and always love. The final movie in the trilogy the Return of the King is my personal favorite out of the three. The awe inspiring action scenes wonderful effects and the touching themes that can be found in this classic tale. This is definitely a film worth watching again and again and again. It is one of those great movies that will stand the test of time and will never get too old to watch.  except the fact i hate Frodo well thats just me personally because hes such a fanny the movie isnt bad at all. its actually a very good way to end the triolegy. but the ending really there were like 8 different endings to that movie showed us what happened with every da*n characters from Legolas to Frodo. we dont care 40 minutes of ending that sucked and pretty much destroyed the expectations. also too many dialogs i understand that theres plenty of plot but still they could have cut some of them and leave them for the really-big-fans-ill-watch-LOTR-for-7hours. i suggest watch it cut the movie 35 minutes before the ending. Rols Rois out :] positive,i started watch the film and my first thought was that its very boring film the boring story and boring actors and i wanted to finished this film but after a while i watch it in shock mind blowing story secrets of main protagonists were very dizzy and i cant break away from screen wow its only word that i could say after film i dont like family drama i rather to a fantastic or horror film but it hit me in my heart ive still in shock for a few days every people have secret and it may occur everybody this film show unusual people in unusual smasterpieceituation what i can say about director he make a masterpiece with a the best actorspositive,I see that 700 and some people have given this movie a rating of 1 What a bunch of melarchy There is so much packed into Pulp Fiction that most movies asked to deliver the same would buckle under the weight The acting is great Its nice to see Travolta in a real movie The editing and story boarding are classic actually they helped redefine the term classic in the genre excellent movie a must see [perfect 10] RIP Mike Sackmanpositive,I saw this movie for the first time 8 years ago. I just happened to see it by chance on cable because I never heard about The Shawshank Redemption before. After watching the movie I was immensely impressed and positively surprised. Definitely this is the best movie Ive ever seen. The story the direction and the cast Specially Tim Morgan and Gil Bellows are perfect The Shawshank Redemption really deserves that spot in the rankings. This movie is a must see The movie not only offers a great viewing experience but also a lesson to take home. Wish more movies are made in this fashion instead of the blood and gore that people seem to appreciate nowadays. Thanks for reading this review.positive,i saw this movie and i wanted to rush to imdb to write a review about how incredible this movie is but instead i decided to wait and let the movie sink in for a little while i have been thinking about this movie for two days pretty much the whole day not many movies do this to me then i saw the movie again and it was just as incredible as the first time i saw it i dont want to give too many details or even any on the story because you just have to see it for yourself ive read some of the negative reviews and those people mostly complain about the laws of physics being broken yes some of the things done in this movie are complete fiction and others are theoretically possible but the genre is called science fiction so distorting some truth is perfectly fine in my bookpositive,I saw this film in 2008 for the first time and have since watched it over 30 times as i just cant get enough of the LoTRs trilogy. I loved the film so much and the LoTRs is now my all time favourite film series. It lives up to its previous two films and leaves you wishing for another film. I totally recommend watching the LoTRs trilogy as all three of the films are absolutely phenomenal. The Return of the King is a great film that rounds of the trilogy nicely it has the quest to take the ring to mount doom and many battle scenes with orcs surrounding minas tirith. The fellowship carry out the rest of the journey separately as they do not stay together until the end.positive,I saw this completely for the first time since I saw it at the theater 4 years ago I dont know HOW I COULDVE LIVED THIS LONG WITHOUT SEEING THIS MASTERPIECEEE and I hadnt realized how COMPLETELY AWESOME this film is I absolutely loved it The story follows Batman where we left him at the end of Batman Begins released in 2005 trying to still cope with the death of his parents and having to face his most infamous enemy: The Joker. The story here is CENTRAL to the movie and is EVERYWHERE. But it is also very emotional epic and sometimes it even has some deeper philosophical meaning to it. Even though BB was pretty dark and totally different from past Bat movies this one goes even DARKERR It makes the villains a lot more realistic that Ras in BB which was basically a ninja. Here The Joker is just an ordinary crazy guy who like Alfred quotes at some point in the movie just wants to watch the world burn. The acting here is what sells the movie in my opinion. I mean Michael Caine as Alfred Morgan Freeman as Lucius Fox Gary Oldman as Jim Gordon and of course Heath Ledger as Joker all deserve special mentions as they all deliver AWESOME ROLES I mean seriously The Joker is so scary and disturbing in this but at the same time we know why he does this as Nolan delves deeply in both the psychology of Joker and Batman. Ledger delivers the performance of his career in this R.I.P Heath You WILL BE MISSEDD : hes absolutely BRILLIANT as is the rest of the cast including Bale as Batman whose only gripe I have with his acting is the stupid voice he makes when he puts on the suit. Its so cartoonish and distracting >_< but Ledger definitely steals the show. Special effects and editing are really good here with the former is even more satisfactorily showcased if you watch the film on Bluray which makes everything look absolutely GORGEOUS Every airborne shot in this is epic. Also the music is also something which enhances the experience in a truly remarkable way. The main theme here is so awesome and overall the music in this composed by known composer Hans Zimmer just makes the movie all the more exciting and emotional when it needs to be. Overall this movie is a must-see for any Bat-fan superhero movie or comic book fan out there. The acting story music etc... everything is just so perfectly balanced to create an even better and epicker I know Ive said the word epic in pretty much every paragraph in this review but cut me some slack I love this movie xDDD film than its already superb predecessor.positive,I saw the dark knight about three years ago when I was in the 8th grade. And I was blown away at how beautifully done it was the camera work the acting the story it all took me by surprise. It is to this day one of the best movies I have ever seen or will see. No other movie can impact you in such an intense way than The Dark Knight. It is a movie worth seeing due to the fact that the workers put so much time and effort into this one film and they did not want to waste money putting up garbage. So Christopher Nolan thank you for not wasting our time instead earning our time with this film. To this day I still am anxious to see the movie at home. I recommend it to anyone who likes action movies in general. To anyone who doesnt dont waste your time write bad reviews about this film.positive,I saw Pulp Fiction back in 1995 on video I was amazed Can you really make a movie like this A film with too much bad language violence booze and drugs Its just too incredible to describe But it has it all and above everything else it has Quentin Tarantino A man with great bad taste He came up with the stories picked the music for the sound track wrote the screenplay and directed and made John Travolta a star again Samuel L Jackson and Uma Thurman reached A-status in Hollywood People dont realize what an achievement that was anymorepositive,i saw it on the opening night in houston tx and it was very much appreciated there was sounds of appreciation during the movie from the viewers and certainly much clapping at the end and sorry this may be a spoiler bit when obamas head exploded all good fun dont take it too seriously however and it was certainly poking fun at britishness and previous films but in a fun way no one i spoke too had a bad word for it it was well paced and kept you involved all the cast were good but samuel l jackson was terrific although a certain resemblance to bond movies it made its own distinctive style i am guessing there will be a follow uppositive,I rented this movie the other night and finished watching it for the first time about an hour ago I thought it was one of the most interesting movies Ive ever seen Ive seen a lot of famous excellent movies in the past month or two and even though most of them are extremely good Pulp Fiction will certainly be one of the most memorablepositive,I remember when i was back in the 08. The Dark Knight its a movie that everyone can think its about The Joker. Well The Joker is awesome but its not entirely him in this picture. Chris Nolan is a genius. This man has create a realistic world when everything in the screen can easily happen in real life. The shoots the screenplay everything is perfect. This is easily the best superhero movie of all time. The performances are OK but heres when Ledgers steals the show. His performance is so perfect very different from the others Jokers. This Joker is a insane man who lives of creating caos you can see that in the scene of the Money Burning and in the end. This man not steal not cheat but expends his own money to create caos. Simply brilliant. The Dark Masterpiece like everyone says to it. Chris Nolan we are waiting for rises.positive,I remember when I used to not like Fantasy movies that much I thought what most people think. Cheesy/unrealistic/weird/freaky...you get the point. When I saw the 1st film I changed my mind I found myslef not only liking it but I loved it. The characters grow on you and they are oustanding in the last film Elijah Woods performance of Frodo was particularly good. These movies may seem childish to some people...but if you begin to accept it for all its magic battles and creatures you see something else. This isnt just a bunch of fancy words with wizards and fairy-tale creatures....its truly a wonderful story that is as real as anything. Do yourself a favor watch these movies. Youll be glad you did because the last one is truly amazing. Ive yet to see a better film and I dont think I ever will.positive,I remember when I first got to see Pulp Fiction I knew absolutley nothing about this film id not even seen a poster or a review nor had I seen Resivoir Dogs although id seen posters for Res Dogs all over the place I cant remember who I watched this film with but the thing that struck me was the opening scene followed by the opening credits They hit me like a brick in the face with the music the likes of which id never heard in film before setting the scene for the fantasic film that was to follow I was transfixed Before Pulp Fiction id relied on more unintelligable action films to provide me with my film entertainment films like Terminator 2 Star Wars or Jurassic park all good films themselves but all relying on big explosions special effects and action to bring me entertainment but it was Pulp Fiction with its second to none dialogue brilliant casting and great sound track that finally made me realise that you dont need a bigger explosion a faster car chase or more arse kicking kung fu fights to make a more exciting or interesting filmpositive,I remember watching this film when I was 13 The film changed my entire view of films and what they could be I used to only watch the films the had super-action in them From when I was 8 up to when I was 13 my favorite films were Terminator 2 Die Hard and Predator Now I still think that those are good films especially the first two but now my eyes were open to a whole new world of film I had never heard of talking for the sake of talking Do what the characters say have anything to do with the plot what so ever not most of the time But those conversations are probably the most important thing in the movie It helps tell who the character is faster than anything else could The performances in the film were all outstanding Im not mad that Travolta didnt win for Best Actor Hanks was brilliant as Forrest Gump But I do think Samuel L Jackson should have gotten a lot of awards for his performance as Jules Harvey Keital was absolutely brilliant as The Wolf His episode was my favorite of all of them A lot of people have ripped off Tarantinos style But now it seems that every film that has violence in it is compared to Tarantino I think he had a huge inpact on the film industry but not that big Otherwise he is my favorite filmmaker out there right now He has yet to dissapoint me 10/10positive,I remember the first time I watched this film. When the last scene was over and the ending credits started rolling I felt some kind of a shudder. I was thrilled. What had just ended couldnt just be a movie or a simple film. I had witnessed something far more important. It was the most exhilarating experience I ever had. There is something about these 25 hours that makes it something of a bigger statement. Its granted that its the best movie in the superhero genre ever but I would argue that it could be one of the best films in general. Here you have an amazing script written by Cristopher and Jonathan Nolan covering issues like friendship family loss death madness politics pain and suffering failures and lies commitment and justice even technology and of course chaos. You have the excellent direction from one of the greatest directors of our time Cristopher Nolan. If you really think about it the main protagonist is wearing a suit that resembles a bat and running the streets with some kind of tank trying to save the world. And yet it translates on the big screen as if its a great tragic story taking place in the real world. As for other important recognitions: Wally Pfister does an amazing work at cinematography and Hans Zimmer with James Newton Howard decided to give us the most amazing  in years. It all went so great mainly because of the great collaboration between the director and everyone else. Nolan is proving to be really trying at getting the best out of his crew... and his attempts to keep every aspect of his work at the top level is shown without denying in the Dark Knight. Im sure you can all understand why its pretty clear that the best thing in the movie is the performances. If anyone told me that he managed to watch this movie and not chill at least for one time while the Joker was on screen... well I would not believe him. Heath Ledger as the Joker is resilient. His representation of this comic book character is epic. Take Cristopher Nolans script and execute it in a perfect way... then take out Heath Ledger and replace him. It would still be great but never the same. He elevated everything. Ledger was the only and perfect choice to play the Joker who for many years to come will represent the absolute and complete villain. But its not just the incomparable Ledger. Christian Bales act is so unique  there is nothing to say. It is just exceptionally plain good. A must to see movie for everyone that carries a heart. positive,I remember i saw the movie in the theater and i was just mesmerized by the performance of Heath Ledger. The acting was so unique and superb in every way that him passing away makes a movie lover very sad. Not only the acting caught my attention but the screenplay as well. Such lines as: Some men just want to watch the world burn and Its all about sending a message when Joker burns all the money. You can feel the chills even now cant you What i like about the movie is that it doesnt only tell the tale of a hero but the whole movie is sending a message that people can change things together. As for the ending I think Joker shouldve got a better ending. I mean we dont get to know where he was taken and what happened to him after Batman caught him. But thats a minor mistake in my opinion. The movie is perfect. Highly recommended  In heres where you need it most he says. You need it so you dont forget. Forget that there are places in the world that arent made out of stone. That theres a - theres a - theres something inside thats yours that they cant touch. Red Morgan Freeman doesnt think much of Andy at first picking that tall glass o milk with the silver spoon up his ass as the first new fish to crack. Andy says not a word and losing his bet Red resents him for it. But over time as the two get to know each other they quickly become the best of friends. This again is one of the films major strengths. Many movies are about love many flicks have a side-kick to the hero but Shawshank is the only one I can think of that looks honestly at the love between two best friends. It seems odd that Hollywood would skip this relationship time and again when its a feeling that weighs so much into everyones day to day lives. Perhaps its too sentimental to seem conventional but Shawshanks core friendship hits all the right notes and the film is much better for it. Its pacing is deliberate as well. As we spend the film watching the same actors it is easy to forget that the movies timeline spans well over 20 years. Such a huge measure of time would pass slowly in reality and would only be amplified in prison. And its not as if the film lacks interest in these moments. It still knows where its going it merely intends on taking its sweet time getting there. It pays off as well as the tedium of prison life makes the climax that much more exhilarating. For anyone who sees it it is a moment never to be forgotten. With themes of faith and hope there is a definite religious subtext to be found here. Quiet selfless and carefree Andy is an obvious Christ figure. Warden Norton Bob Gunton is obviously modeled on Richard Nixon who in his day was as close to a personified Satan as they come. But if you arent looking for subtexts the movie speaks to anyone in search of hope. It is a compelling drama and a very moving film perfectly written acted and shot. They just dont come much better than this. OVERALL : 9.8/10 = A+ The Shawshank Redemption served as a message of hope to Hollywood as well. More than any film in memory it proved there is life after box office. Besting Forrest and Fiction it ran solely on strong word of mouth and became the hottest rented film of 1995. It currently sits at #2 in the IMDbs Top 250 Films occasionally swapping spots with The Godfather as the top ranked film of all time -- redemption indeed. If you havent seen it yet what the hell are you waiting for As Andy says It comes down a simple choice really. Either get busy living or get busy dying. positive,I remember first watching this movie and yes Ive watched it many times. It was at a movie theater with my father. At the end of the movie I kind of just sat there and then looked at my dad. He just looked at me and said That was a good movie wasnt it The theatrics in this movie are astounding. This movie will have you on the edge wondering how and where the story will develop and go. Christopher Nolan was an excellent pick for Batman and Ill be disappointed to see him go. The Joker despite his horrid persona adds suspense and a mix of unpredictable action. If you havent purchased this movie or are thinking about purchasing this movie Ill save you the time and just tell you to go ahead and purchase it. You wont regret it.  what is so good about this film isit the story the director the actors or maybe just all of this things. I mean what makes this the best movie ever made Isit the feel-good feeling in the end I dont know a person whose doest feel good after this movie. Tims and Morganss performances both deserved Oscar but Im not gonna takeit from Tom Hanks that his performance in Forres Gump also deserved Oscar. So if anyone can tell me the ONE thing that makes this the best movie ever made. positive,i remember being one of the select few of being a bit overly excited hearing that guardians was about to get their big screen debut yes i knew it was a huge gamble honestly it was a winwin situation for them if it was good then mcu could bring any character to life if it was bad it was a lesson learned pair them up with the avengers like in the comics and continue on a lot of people werent thrilled about this but i kept my hopes high last night i was able to catch the movie on the night of july 31st holy crap this movie delivered i loved everything about this film it had everything it was hard for me to dislike any one on the team though rocket and groot were the stars of these losers starlord gamora and draxhell even yondu was nice one thing i really liked that had a bit of an advantage over the avengers was that they all sacrificed for each other they grew into a family the more and more the film developed the only gripe i had about the movie was i wish thanos was just a tad bit more in here ronan was cool but just didnt hit a home run maybe got to 3rd base but nothing past that what more can i say about this? easily the first 10 giving out from me in a long time you will laugh you will cryhave that tear in your eye never thought i would say that for a marvel film but you will even find yourself dancing stay for the end credits duh sit back and enjoy the nostalgia i wish i could have given this higher than a 10positive,I really wish I could shake Quentins hand for this one He has really done it this is Mr Tarantino at his very best I know there are some low-minded people who dont like this type of a violent and - in the same time - awfully funny film containing drugs shooting and guns but I most certainly love it Actually I dont think this film is a very violent oneI know this is only my opinion and maybe Im used to watch violent films or something Well check out Tarantinos From dusk till dawn theres a bloody film with lots of splatter Still the big difference between for example From dusk till dawn and this one is the fact that From dusk till dawn is pure entertainment with no meaning of any kind and this is a very smart movie Ive seen this film about a million times but its never even slightly boring Outstanding script and wonderful actors: simply one of the best movies Ive ever seen truly a masterpiecepositive,I really wanted to watch this movie when it first came out but I didnt get a chance. I was so desperate to see why everyone was raving about it. When I saw it I automatically knew why. I instantly loved it. Everything about this film is brilliant. The superbly written smart and witty script has been suitably chosen for each character. The suspense that is built up in some scenes is done extremely well with the choppy editing by Lee Smith. Wally Pfisters camera work is outstanding. But what is probably the best thing about the film is the acting. Each actor does the role of their character magnificently well. None more so then Heath Ledger. His portrayal of the evil joker is so amazingly good that I still feel chills down the back of my spine every time he appears on screen. A film that can be loved by people who arent really batman fans. 10/10positive,I really love how Quentin Tarentio reuses his cast through out his movies Every main character from his previous hit Reservoir Dogs made some kind of appearance in Pulp Fiction Not only do the actors tie his individual movies together but if you look back from his current movies to some of his first films you can usually find a little microcosm from that film that he used as a base to create a new film The movie had a good rhythm even with the scenes being out of order It defiantly keeps you thinking about the film and how the story really played out This film is pretty violent but not as much as Tarentios newer films Tarentio has his own style and is totally an auteur director of the modern film profession I would highly recommend seeing his films but be ready for some Extreme violencepositive,I really like this movie. I love Batman. I must say that this is one of the best films Ive seen I like it much better than Batman Begins but I think that it ended too fast and that two face shouldnt have died.. This movie is one of the best movies on the planet because of Heath Ledgers portrayal of the Joker. The story is so exciting and you are waiting with anticipation to see what happens next. The film sees Batman confront the Joker as he gets trapped in his twisted little games along the way. If you havent seen this movie get out there and buy it because Im telling you that you wont regret it. I give the film a 10/10.positive,I really hate those censorious critics. When everyone is saying The Dark Knight is truly one of the top five movies in the whole history and the movie itself is becoming really popular someone laughs coldly and says things like this is the most overrated movie ever made. And if you go deeper to their ideas you find all they have done is pick up the small detailed flaws of the movie which is completely not affecting the whole quality and worthiness of seeing more than twice of the movie. Hey boy WHY SO SERIOUS I wonder if those people work in a watch factory in which you are never allowed to make a single tiny mistake because if you do you will ruin the whole work. Movie is art and art is never perfect. Its imperfection is the very thing that makes it amazing. The Dark Knight is not perfect or in other word can anyone name a literally perfect movie Is Godfather perfect or The Shawshank Redemption But they are indeed amazing arent they I really think The Dark Knight should be even longer maybe three hours will do. This is a so complex multi-layer script for many directors its too hard to tell the story and make it clear to the audience. The Nolans made it although not 100 percent but they did make it understood plus shining plus intriguing If the movie were long enough the story-telling would be even more clear and very importantly not that tied up which is the biggest shortage of The Dark Knight. Then its time to talk about why it is so amazing. I hate to say everything in the movie is great because thats over-simplifying and showing no respect for the standing out. THE JOKER its him who makes the movie different. Its not only about Heaths actingactually I have no idea how to describe how great his acting is it simply defies description its about the role. Many marvel that this joker is the NO1 villain of the history indeed he is why Because he never deserves anyones mercy in other words he is in absolute terms bad bad enough to go way beyond the punishment people make to measure the fierceness of bad. He is a villain that will stay longer in your heart and control your thoughts than your best hero image can do. A hero is an examplepositive,i really enjoyed this movie the soundtrack was cool surprising and unique i was glad that the songs that peter listened to werent there just there to punch up a scene i might have chosen different songs but these songs were perfect and chris pratts peter is such a contemporary and real guy that no matter how odd situations became his reactions and utterances made everything seem plausible i only had a quibble with the narrow metaphorical background which seems to be a constant in most super hero films i wont go into details here just suffice it to say that when i saw chris pratts other film the lego movie i was encouraged to see the idea of the one relegated to the position of nonsense i loved it when morgan freemans wise man states that the reason that his prophesy is true is based on the fact that it rhymes back to guardians  the plot and script were solid the graphics were just amazing i watched the 3d version and it is excellent i always feel like 2d films are really missing something after a good 3d viewing and this 3d film is superb i do think that we are on some strange path of always having to one up the mayhem levels of previous films and i think that it does not make the drama more effective to continually raise the body count what is our intent in making films? i think we could make better films with less mindless darkness zombies and vampires and fears oh mypositive,I really dont like to jump on a band wagon like this. Though I had been longing for this movie for over a year and though I was expecting great things from it this nerdy and geeky talk of comic book fans best movie ever really got onto my nerves. Living in Germany I had to wait until yesterday to finally watch the movie and I could watch all the craziness going on on the net from afar. I still wanted to like the movie but I really feared that all this hype might ruin it for me. Well now that I have finally seen it I have to say that my fears were to a large part unnecessary. the movie is great and I think it is as good as a movie like this can be. Though I still get annoyed by teenagers who yell that this is the best movie ever I can understand where they are coming from. Every decade or so there is one movie that becomes a real phenomenon. And if you never experienced this than you become part of the group that says this is our movie and we wont let grumpy idiots take it away from us. When I was at that age for me it was Jurassic Park and later to a certain extent also Titanic and I bet most of the kids who hype this movie have not been consciously around then. I thought the acting was great overall. Heath Ledger definitely stands out. Christian Bale is great too. His work as the twisted Batman/Bruce Wayne character has to be a lot more subtle in this movie and he achieves that wonderfully. Unfortunately due to Ledgers tour de force performance Bales work seems to go unappreciated by many here. I could go on and on. There is not a single weak performance in this movie although the Mayor becomes a bit distracting because of his heavy eye-liner but thats not the actors fault. I love the scope of this movie. The main storyline is always in focus but there still is room for subplots here and there which are all set up perfectly and fit within the overall plot. And even though you might wish to see more of some characters like Alfred you nevertheless dont feel that they were underused. The pacing is great as well. You keep being interested the entire time and the movie flows so naturally that you never get the feeling that this action sequence here happens because there has to be an action sequence. So is this the best movie ever I leave that up to everyone to decide for himself. It is not perfect but no movie even the best is completely flawless. There are things in this movie that I didnt like too much. I wish they had done more with Two-Face and the whole bit about the cell phones seemed a bit gimmicky for me I also didnt like Batmans eyes in these scenes. But there is so much to like in this film. One has to applaud the filmmakers for going against conventions by for example killing of characters not just at the climax of the movie but right in the middle. I also loved it that the movie does not end with the big machine of the villain that he has to start in order to rule the world even Batman begins fell into that trap. They found a perfectly neat solution to it all and though I think the ending is not perfect I think it still is great as it is. The same thing can be said about the whole movie. I love it that the script of this movie is so smart that it even takes time to ask philosophical questions. Sure it doesnt go too deep but it is mentioned in a way that most moviegoers will be able to think about this. I had a perfect time at the cinema and think that for what it is this movie can indeed be called a masterpiece.positive,I read the books before the films were made I was part of a reading group that discussed only the work of Tolkien and all that. The movies for me at the time and until today are amazing. Of course The Return of the King as a sum of all the finales you have in all those histories told by Tolkien at the same time is just flawless. I cried in all the ending as I had cried when I was reading. Those characters are part of my life. This history is part of my life. Some of my best friends are still part of our old reading group and even my fianc’© is the amazing girl that though we really bet somewhere else I got to really know in this same group. I think that there arent some many histories like this one that can connect people like me and my friends so profoundly.positive,i read about this movie and i was told it took 11 years to be finished so that the actors could grow up as the movie was being made then i saw the title and read the plot and decided to give this a try it turned out to be the best decision of the month maybe of the year not only boyhood is extremely good its also relatable the film may be 3 hours long but i only noticed how long it was when it was actually over its that kind of film that keeps you thinking about anything in life in your life and it might be life changing for you as it was to the main character despite not having the most famous cast every single actor portrays a brilliant role and each one of the main characters shine the whole movie i highly recommend this one because you never know when were having a film as good as thispositive,I personally think this is the best movie ever made Now that is not to say it is my favorite movie to watch that isnt exactly true but I have yet watched a movie with a better interpretation of graphics storyline and overall entertainment. I found myself trudging through Fellowship of the Ring entertained by Two Towers and then BLOWN AWAY by Return of the King I love this movie and though it would eventually get old as it is not my FAVORITE movie it comes in a close second behind my favorite Revenge of the Sith. Still excellent movie and kudos to Peter Jackson and his like two seconds on screen getting shot by Legolas He made a truly spectacular movie. I recommend it to all my friends.positive,i personally loved the film it is an impressionist film its about feelings and images and if you try to analyse individual strokes  the picture falls apart but so is metropolis albeit metropolis has a much better musical  despite the film shortcomings of which i will talk extensively i still give it 10 stars as its been a while since a movie would really engage me on some deeper levels of course there are plot gaps and the film stumbles sometimes dragging painfully slow sometimes rushing through skipping over but even despite the lack of consistency and attention to writing it brought me to magical places and i consider it to be one of the greatest movies ive seen up to date interstellar is evidently inspired by the 2001 space odyssey and i think christopher nolan in his attempt perhaps moved one step closer to making some of the ideas that kubrick expressed more palatable in case of 2001 space odyssey i appreciate the idea and feeling behind it but find it excruciatingly painful to endure long minutes of watching one cardboard piece slowly sliding on top of another  especially in this age where the audience is spoiled by the hyperrealistic cgi renderings just in case one have heightened expectations of the movie here are things that are wrong about interstellar and one should be prepared for it since the film is not about space at all  its about human emotions and also circumstances where our humanity would fall apart and reassemble itself differently interstellar is inherently impressionist and symbolic like metropolis where form and meaning of symbols take precedence over their literal meaning or technical implementation interstellar sacrifices a lot here are some of the things that are wrong with the film  overexaggerations and often stretched emotions where normal people would behave differently  massive plot holes and often lack of reason on behalf of the characters  bearable but mediocre musical   sketchy and shallow characters unreasonable immature adults behaving like spoiled teenagers  science touches some advanced topics while falling short at basics strictly speaking the movie is not science fiction i wish that christopher nolan for his next project would involve more mature and qualified people in writing pay attention to detail and spend more time in making characters more believable  i think by now he can certainly afford it that being said in my opinion interstellar is perhaps his best work up to date where for me personally its certainly more important than his other masterpiece dark knight as the latter was a form of high quality entertainment while interstellar is something to be inspired with speaking of the film  hans zimmer is definitely among my least favourite film composers he is not a composer at all a good sound designer at times but he cant do any music the loud minimalist  with organ chords sketchy piano notes and synths at times was reminiscent of also sprach zarathustra used in the kubriks movie and that created a certain atmosphere but the rest of the  if one would look for a positive word to describe it is hardly anything more than bearablepositive,I never saw this film on the silver screen. I didnt want to see it on video either. The video store owner implored me to watch it and I remember my emphatic reply. Im not watching a 3 hour film about a prison con doing tax returns for the guards. Fortunately for me this video store owner was a mightily persistent sort and I begrudgingly walked home not knowing that I had just rented the greatest film ever made. This film received no hype nor the mega-bucks publicity given to a lot of movie trash out there. Because they didnt need to - all they needed to do was to let people watch it because word of mouth is the best marketing ticket in town. And so it proved. The movie is long and relies on a storyline which has been covered many times. Wrongful conviction brutality in jail justice in the end. But it is the way in which the story is told and acted out that defines it quite rightly as IMDbs top ranked film. I dont care for Stephen King as an author but his vivid imagination coupled with his skill at telling a story a short story in this case is top drawer. We have a man Dufresne who after being convicted wrongfully for murder uses his accounting skills in jail solely to survive. Red Freeman the man who can get things befriends him. The story then slowly unravels with shocking scenes of brutality intertwined with flickers of how the human spirit can overcome the most hazardous odds. The Warden Samuel Norton is magnificent as a man whose corruption has spiralled out of control and will do almost anything to retain the status quo. Clancy Brown as the brutal guard completes the double act. The story twists and turns leaving the audience not quite knowing whether we are in for a harrowing or euphoric ending. And when the ending comes on that Mexican Beach you can almost hear the triumphant cheers ringing around the cinema halls. This is film making at its very best and it is highly unlikely that Robbins and Freeman will ever better it. Its one of those few occasions where 10 stars is not nearly high enough. So if you have been living under a rock or are as sceptical as I was in the early 90s then its time for me to adopt my friendly video store owners guise and say Watch this - its the best film ever made.positive,I need to go again so I can see more of the movie - my first viewing was not enough to see everything. I must admit to being slightly disappointed by a couple of things: - I felt that the Palantir were not done well at all - no explanation and context seemed wrong - much I guess due to the cutting of Sarumans scenes. As an avid reader of the books I missed the Mouth of Sauron the mustering of the allies before Pelennor Fields Saurumans downfall and ultimate end during the Scouring of the Shire. My other issue is one that I guess cannot be overcome in movie adaptions of books and that is the loss of almost all of Tolkeins rich historical fabric of Middle Earth. To even attempt it would have required a voice over which I dont think would have worked. These minor nitpicks aside so many things were excellent: - The aerial tracking shot of Gandalf and Pippin riding up through the 7 rings of Minas Tirith The Witch King preparing for war and his downfall at the hands of Dernhelm Grond the Ride of the Rhorrim Shelob Gollum Samwise Gamgee - Sean Astin acting his socks off compared to any previous work Aragorn and all the men bowing to the four hobbits Overall I think Peter Jackson and fellowship have crafted a truely excellent movie and a fitting end to the Trilogy. I havent made up my mind whether it is the best of the three yet. I still favour FOTR if only for the reason that it was the first and it so clearly proved that it was possible to make Middle Earth real on film and keep the spirit of the books.positive,I myself like most people love this movie and whenever it got to the end where you see Andy and Red smiling and embracing on the beach it always sent chills through my soul but I realized that in addition to that sequence where not a word is spoken between the two men its that deep blue ocean that makes the ending so dramatic. I think with the exception of a few outdoor scenes in the movie where you see a little sky the bulk of the movie is shot in the drab gray tones of prison cause prison is drab and gray so when that BIG BLUE OCEAN hits your eyes it makes the whole experience of their freedom and the fact that they never gave up hope that much more dramatic. Hope is definitely a good thing and quite possibly the best of ALL things.positive,I must say that Pulp Fiction caught me totally surprised with its artistic story telling and dialogue Quentin Tarantino is the factor behind this and the cast are perfect for the story John Travoltas performance here is probably the best Ive ever seen from him and his dance here is the greatest he performed Pulp Fiction requires quiet a bit of thinking to endure the story because if youre the type who only likes special effects or who does not think and listen youll easily get turned off Understanding what you hear and see here is the key and I recommend this film to anyone who can Dont listen to those pro-life supporters anti-violence supporters special-effects-loversgo watch this film  beautiful but plain  action-packed but clever  touching but cynical  And oh these characters I love the film though i dont count Tarantino a genius or something as you may think not positive,I must say I was excited for this movie since the instant BATMAN BEGINS appeared on screen at the end of the first film. It was always going to be good and sadly it was always going to be over-hyped by the advertising warhorses. It is rare though that a movie can surpass all the hype and pass all expectations on the film. Nolan The Prestige Begins delivers on more than the Joker we remember from the Old Days of Burton and Nicholson. Instead were given a psychopathic sadist who pleasures from sheer anarchy. All the hailing of Ledgers performance are grounded. Watching it will make you feel a different chill down your spine than youd remember from any other film. Its impossible quite literally to relate to The Joker. He gets inside your head with his stories of how he got his scars makes you laugh at his sick jokes then makes you instantly wonder why youre laughing. If Ledger wasnt enough to horrify you - wait for Harvey Dent. Brilliantly portrayed by Aaron Eckhart as Gothams fallen White Knight and Batmans direct counterpart. His transformation will put Tommy Lee Jones portrayal look like childrens breakfast cartoons. Gyllenhaal had perfect chemistry with both Bale and Eckhart Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman both work well as Batmans conscience and of course Gary Oldman as Lieutenant Gordon were all solid. There are some major differences between The Dark Knight and Begins. Firstly the music is extremely disconcerted compared with the majestic but unfinished tones of Begins - but it suits the films tone: Anarchy in every sense. There was a more solid singular villain compared with the many in Begins - but there was also a lot more henchmen in TDK. The martial art direction was faster and more efficient - as mentioned in the film learning through experience. I was disappointed at the role of Scarecrow in this film it just felt like a loose thread and wasnt quite closed up or explained and the ending while it wasnt what I expected others have said that it was predictable but for me it wasnt was solid and suited the film well. All in all this is a film that is quite close if it isnt already a masterpiece. Nolan has a great thing going and unlike previous Superhero adaptations Spiderman and Fantastic Four for example there isnt campiness creeping in. In face if Batman Begins was 10/10 The Dark Knight deserves a 12. Quite simply the best possible sequel that couldve been given. If you watch this which I implore that you do you certainly wont regret it. One of the best movies of 2008 Ill wait till Quantum of Solace comes out before I pass judgement - but certainly a film worth getting excited for. If you dont like it then thats also fine - but keep in mind that you probably thought Meet The Spartans was a good movie so the rest of us wont take it to heart. Stunning in every aspect and exceeds all hype and expectation... Cant wait to watch it again or for the Blu-Raypositive,I must admit I had my doubts whether this film would live up to the incredibly high standards set by the first two films but it has spectacularly succeeded. Once again Viggo Mortensen delivers a polished and convincing performance as Aragorn Orlando Bloom remains a very good Legolas and Elijah Wood puts in a fantastic performance as Frodo Baggins. The special effects and computer generated scenes remain incredible and very difficult to tell from the real scenes especially during the epic final battle. I always think that the final film in a series is the most difficult as the director has to tie up any loose ends but Peter Jackson makes it look effortless - this is definitely one of the best films he has ever made. While the trilogy doesnt exactly follow the plot of the books and this film is no exception it still captures all of the ideas laid out in the books by J.R.R.Tolkein. A must-watch film.positive,I made my account on IMDb Just to Rate this movie. :- I had heard from someone that Tim Robins has done a great job in this movie. but when i started watching this movie i could not move my ass for 142 Min. its not just about Tim Robins or Morgen Freeman.. its the whole storylinedialogs and cinematography which insist you to watch this whenever you feel low in your life. Movie has some great lines. When AndyTim Robins brake the Jail Morgon Freeman says I have to remind myself that some birds arent meant to be caged. Their feathers are just too bright This movie has entertainment Feelings Action Drama a little comedy. In short everything we want to see in a movie. I have seen this movie around 100 times and sure will watch more then 10000 times before i die. 1 of the best movies i have ever seen in my life.. Wish i could see that sort of movie again in my lifepositive,I love this movie. It is one of my favorite movies of all time. Of course the book is better it has more detail in it. But overall I think that the movie had some pretty awesome detail in it. I recommend this to anyone who has seen and liked The Hobbit. If you are going to watch this movie then I suggest that you get prepared for random attacks jumping up in your seat from a monster on the screen or even get a little bit excited for the romance that is in the movies of the series. If you dont like Harry Potter this is still a good movie for you to watch. You should probably watch the movies in order because the last one will make like no sense what-so-ever. Be prepared for action and adventure because that is what this movie is all about. Thank you for taking time to read my review on The Lord of the RingsThe Return of the King.positive,I love this movie it is a perfect mixture of crime joke and wisdoms Quarterpounder = Royal Cheese Since today I have seen this film a dozen times Cant belief that this film is over 20 years old In my opinion this is the best Tarantino movie Every time I can recognize new things I love the para-language from John Travolta and the black humor from Samuel L Jackson This movie has three different stories Vincent Vega and Marsellus Wallace Wife golden watch and Bonnie situation with no time chronology Since today I have no idea what is in the suitcase  - positive,I love this movie almost as much as the second in the trilogy my favorite movie. The one complaint even though it goes with the book perfectly is Aragorns saving of Gondor with the dead army. For some reason it just seems to easy for them to win like that but it is in the book. To make up for that battle just watch the extended edition of the final battle at the black gates of Mordor which I loved. The whole story is such a great rendering of the book that i cant vote anything but a ten. Some of my other favorite parts are when Frodo wakes up at the end and when Bilbo goes to live with the elves. If you want to know more about this series check out a book called The Silmarilion which covers the making of the earth and the first and second ages. There are many references in the Lord of the rings to events which happened before most of the characters time excepting the immortal elves of course. Best Trilogy Ever.positive,I love that line. Every time Samuel L. Jackson or Jules recites his line from he bible I am sitting there like wow. This is powerful stuff. And then BANG. He shoots somebody. Lets get it straight. Quinten Tarantino is a genius. As the movie goes the stories of 2 mobsters a mobsters wife a boxer and two restaurant robbers intertwine in absolutely the most perfect of ways. The two mobsters played by Jackson and John Travolta give two Oscar nominated performances in order to bring their characters to life. Uma Thurman who plays Marsellus Wallaces wife. The scene where she is drugged out and Vega travoltas character has to drive adrenaline through her heart I was sweating in my seat. SO INTENSE. Bruce Willis is also fantastic. Such a great movie perhaps the greatest ensemble of acting in a movie. Not a best picture winner however. I only say that because Forrest Gump is the greatest film of all time. But that being said Pulp Fiction wins in essentially any other year.positive,I love Pulp Fiction There are no two ways about it From Samuel L Jacksons hip but stuck in the 70s gangster to Ving Vhames big and mean head gangster this movie provides no shortages of great acting This movie goes into several parts all kind of coming together in some way or another John Travola plays in my opinion the role of his career as Vincent Vega He takes out out the head gangsters wife on an almost-fatal date She snorts herion and Ill leave it to that I especially enjoyed Bruce Willis as the boxer I thought this was a great role for him He and the head ganster get in a massive fight and the gun-store owner and the sheriff do some repulsive things to the two of them Christopher Walken has a humorous cameo as the young boxers fathers army buddy When they kill a man inside their car Jackson and Travolta go to Quinton Tarantino who obviously feels a need for acting in his own movies who in turn calls a lets get to business type in Harvey Keitel Keitel does a good job in this role as he does in every role he ever does The ending is very good also I give it an A+positive,I love everything about this filmpositive,I love cinema I love Mr. Jackson I love Extended DVDs and I love New Line. Now that the trilogy is over I will at last be free to actively seek a girlfriend and rediscover the many faceted social life Ive been patiently ignoring for the better part of this century...  thrilling spectacle is underd with palpable human drama and it finally becomes clear why J.R.R. Tolkiens books continue to ring such bells so loudly in the lives of so many. positive,I like this film There appear to be spelling mistakes in your review Some suggestions have been made if you wish to review them Select the correct words from the dropdown menus and they will be replaced for you There appear to be spelling mistakes in your review Some suggestions have been made if you wish to review them Select the correct words from the dropdown menus and they will be replaced for you There appear to be spelling mistakes in your review Some suggestions have been made if you wish to review them Select the correct words from the dropdown menus and they will be replaced for you There appear to be spelling mistakes in your review Some suggestions have been made if you wish to review them Select the correct words from the dropdown menus and they will be replaced for you There appear to be spelling mistakes in your review Some suggestions have been made if you wish to review them Select the correct words from the dropdown menus and they will be replaced for you  he is unforgettable as a pontificating hit-manTarantino borrows and/or steals from everyone and everything be it Hong Kong or blaxploitation but he does it well  this is one glossy good looking smartly written B movie Amanda Plummer Uma Thurman and Harvey Keitel among others provide great support  only Bruce Willis as usual drops the proverbial ball But even hes not enough to sink this terrific picture OKWell not SO intelligent with all the unnecessary swearing and violence but it was a great film divided into very exciting segments which left you wondering what would happen next Although some of the segments were led to the wrong direction which also make me think that the movie didnt make sense but you WILL get it The best part has to bewhen John Travolta and Samuel L Jackson get those druggos in their apartment Uma Thurman was great in this film very fresh and alive well not really alive after that encounter with the needle The film was very bloody and had a lot of swearing but you didnt really focus on that when watching the film - it was that exciting Well overall here are my ratings  positive,I like the fantasy movie and specially like The Lord of the Rings. This movie in appear Legolas  He is very handsome and quick in action He riding a shield shoot an arrow to monster  This is thrilling situation. and This movie appear Gollum. Hes a successful role Hes a dual personality.. My precious~ My precious~ Gollums line is very impressive. This appear movie in Battlevariety Magic Monster etc.. and It was a very impression movie. also It was contained love story This movie is an exciting movie Im recommend this movie :-Dpositive,I left the theater on December 16th without the words to describe what I have just seen. I still dont really. No other movie has done that to me since Braveheart. No other movie has moved me to complete and utter shock then Return of the King. Shock that it was so good. Shock that I actually wasnt DISAPPOINTED for a movie ive been waiting for for years. Shock that I actually cried to a movie picture. It took me a whole day to become un-overwhelmed and I just had to see it again. The second viewing solidified the movie as The Greatest Movie Ever Madeat least to me The scenery was beautiful. The acting was flawless. Give Sean Astin and Ian McKellen the Oscar. Now. Sean Astins Samwise Gamgee and Ian McKellens Gandalf WILL go down in movie history as two of the most beloved film characters. A few cuts from the book left me a bit disappointed but it didnt spoil the film on a whole for me one bit. They will be in the Extended Editions DVDs so Im not too worried about it. All and all the greatest movie ever made. Bar none. Move over Godfather here comes Return of the King.positive,I knew it would be good but this takes the entire cake. Peter Jackson has absolutely outdone himself with this masterpiece. True there are a few tiny holes in the plot but they are easily overlooked. Even if youre not a huge fan of Tolkien you should really make an attempt to see this movie. I wasnt a fan of the books but Jacksons movies have inspired me to pick them up and give them all a good read. Cant wait for the DVD. Lets see if Jackson does as good a job with The Hobbit.positive,I knew about this movie for a long time. Heck prison movies dont turn me on so I have very negative impression hence not watching it. I watched it today Oct 2005 as it was on TV and I thought its got good rating so Ill watch it least this way I wont be watching it alone. Might as well get it over with. Well any movie than can render a grown adult to tears and whirl up an emotional minefield has to be respected. This movie has my utmost respect. This is truly a great film even with all my negative baggage and seeing clips and reading people raving about it I still avoided it. To render a grown man to cry even with all the baggage has to be a really amazing film. This film transcends cinema to what its truly about - to move you. So technically its pointless you can go about actors direction shots music and so on and to analyse this film purely on that level would be one very stupid mistake. A mistake many have used while writing reviews. The book or film is simply a mechanism to get a message across it can be flawed and still work perfectly. Thats not the point. The message here is clear and works perfectly on many unconscious levels it really would be stupid to try an figure it out. You cant as its so simple. We all have hope dreams and desires and want freedom and a better future. Every person does. Its actually why we exist. Not to have hope dreams and desires and goals is truly not to live. Not doing so there is no meaning to life. No matter what happens keep positive have hopes dreams and desires that is your purpose here on this planet this is what this film is about everything else is just mechanics to get this across Are you Positive Do you have hopes Do you have dreams Do you have goals Have you helped your fellow man just for the beauty and pleasure of making someone happy in a totally unselfish way without any personal gain If you havent and dont have hopes dreams desires and goals you are not alive you have no meaning to your life. In conclusion you can avoid this film as long as you want like I did but when it does catch up with you... you better be ready very ready. If you arent or dont understand what you are watching and what really is going on between the lines and mechanics of the imperfect mechanism of cinema you are dead truly dead and you might as well end it now. So my advise to you Dont Watch this film. If youve read this far and not got what Ive been going on about you are a lost cause already and you might as well go into your miserable life and causing misery to yourself and others. Heck itll take you several lifetimes probably to get it. So remember DONT WATCH THIS FILM you dont deserve it.positive,i just watched gone girl it seems talking about a possessive girl but when you look closer to the act you would observe her insecurity from loneliness and being stereotyped as a good girl as amazing amy as she has been forced to be someone she isnt she keeps her reputation by libeling men and tries to have more personal space by threatening them being polite kind and nice to people getting married having children and bringing up childrenthese all are the female figure in most countries she cant escape from the media because she is the girl in the novel so she chooses to have the freedom in this limitation she is a murder of her husbands freedom but she is also murdered by the stereotype of women in society i love the movie=] its a typical theme with a bloody rational expressionpositive,I just wanted to say that for a long time i thought it was just a crappy fiction movie but i was completely wrong. Its the best movie ever made : The Lord of the Rings is a fairy-tale of myth and fantasy. Peter Jackson directed a film that was considered for a very long time impossible to make and not only for technical reasons. The narrative roots are incredibly long and detailed and the storyline is deeply connected with the creation of a fantastic continent from a time unknown called Middle Earth. Its author Tolkien dedicated a considerable part of his life developing this continents background its mythology and origins its different kinds of people cultures and languages and therefore its geographic references are determinant to the unfolding of the story of the One Ring.positive,I just want to say WOW. The end of the journey comes in this movie as a brilliant ending. Not only for the fantastic effects in this moviepositive,I just saw The Dark Knight and it was even better than I expected and I expected it to be great. Most of this comment is about Heath Ledger so let me start by giving Christian Bale and the rest of the awesome cast directormake-upspecial effects team writers producers and so on a huge thank you for doing such an amazing job in and on this movie. Now for Ledger. People can say what they want about Heath getting too much praise just because he is no longer with us cause it just isnt true. Alive or gone this was the performance of a lifetime. The make-up the laugh the mannerisms every little thing he did was perfect. I have always had an image in my mind of how the joker was and this was finally it. I love Jack Nicholson because he is one of the best actors alive but I am sorry Jack because Heath Ledger just out shined you and that is not easy to do. I was praying the entire movie that the joker would not be killed because it would have just been too symbolic and I would have lost it. I did cry at the end though. The ending when two face the commissioner and batman are talking about life and death and how unfair and too soon it can be it really struck home and paralleled Heath Ledgers untimely passing. It is completely unfair that Heaths family and the world are going to miss out on such an amazing person with some of the rarest and rawest talent I have ever seen. I am a single mother and I cant even begin to imagine losing my daughter so my heart goes out to Heaths family and his daughter. I am truly sorry that such an amazing man died so young. Dahr Princepositive,I just love The Lord of the Rings and this one is amazing. I recommend this movie to anyone and everyone It is adventurous heart-warming and a tear-jerker. It is definitely the best way to end the trilogy. I cried so much but it was wonderful and I will never forget it. I love anything that has to do with The Lord of the Rings and this movie completely changed my life. The Lord of the Rings is such a wonderful story full of love friendship action and hope. I am reading the books too and I think that all three of these movies follow the storyline very well. I just know that anyone who will watch these movies will love it. Of course I recommend reading the books first  its just FILM. This is what movies are all about: great dialogues characters you can relate to although they are probably just as distant to your reality as e.g. the monsters in Bad Taste and appropriate music. Its not a movie you can just turn on and watch unfocused though. If you really want to enjoy it youll probably have to see it three times or more. If youre not planning on doing this dont watch it Then of course theres the mystery behind Pulp Fiction. Whats in the briefcase Although plausible theories have been developed well probably never know for sure. Quoting the man himself Tarantino on the question Whats in the briefcase: Anything you want.... To be brief: I really think this is the best movie ever made... positive,I just have to say Pulp Fiction is one of the best movies I have ever seen. It is funny creative satirical and intelligentpositive,i just got back from a screening here in hungary and i am just not able to get the movie out of my head almost 3 hours but for me it felt like 3 minutes so captivating so real not gimmicky not cheesy well done america what really amazes me is that this movie was able to get my attention for almost 3 hours without any breakthrough and grand action maybe it did so because this movie was about real life life as it is grandmothers and mothers fathers and stepfathers sisters and friends young love and teenager life moving and fighting cheating and tears throughout the movie i had this diverse feelings inside me one of them is happiness and gladness because as the movie showed us life is beautiful life is extraordinary on the other side i felt depressed because as the movie showcased we are confused we dont know what and how to do we dont really know what life is and we expect so much more of it but i think the main message of the movie is at the ending that was perfect every moment seizes us this movie seized me astonishingpositive,I just finished watching the Dark Knight for probably the 10th time. Watched it again right after watching Batman Begins. Truly I just can not believe how close to perfect this movie is. It excites me so much that even after so many times I still find myself cheering crying and smiling during. To me this is a 10 out of 10. To me this is what a movie should be. To me this is the best movie of the decade by far if not even more. A few things I wish could be fixed to make it a truly perfect experience: 1. The Dark Knight is the last performance of Heath Ledger. I will never be able to see anything new from him again. Heath to me is a God in this movie and I wish he was still around as honestly his performance is in the top 3 of all time movie performances in my book. 2. Third movie is in the works I think.. I am sure I will be disappointed. I mean how can it get any better than this 3. Did they have to crash the Lamborghini Murcielago every time i see that happen I go geez I am here hello just call me Honestly The Dark Knight is not a movie - its an emotional experience that is rare I experience when looking at my screen. R.I.P Heath Ledgerpositive,I havent seen too many movies that I would rate a 10 but I had no problems giving this one top . Movie-making seems to be like golfpositive,I havent read anything by Tolkien. It is a great credit to these movies that you can watch all three without needing to have taken in the novels beforehand. This is an excellent end to an incredible trilogy. The plot is engaging from start to finish and this moves rather smoothly with great pacing. This is funny several times and there is very little of the annoyingand still easily ignored comic relief. I am thrilled to see Gollum turn out to be such a richly detailed and thoroughly developed character. The meld of live-action and CGI elements is perfect. You forget that not everything youre seeing is really there. The effects are impeccable in general and the imaginative designs and boundless creativity are amazing. Creepy and dark this isnt actually depressing in spite of many gloomy moments. The battle sequences are intense well-choreographed and awesome. This has astonishing editing and cinematography and has a marvelous look. The acting doesnt let you down at any point. There is a lot of scary and disturbing content in this and it might be too much for children. I recommend this to any fan of the fantasy genre and really everyone who enjoys an appreciation for the medium of film. 10/10positive,I have written a few reviews on IMDb and Shawshank is one of my favorite movies of all time. I dont necessarily think this movie was a 10 but an easy 9 for me. I am giving it a 10 because of the negative reviews that I read with saying they gave this movie a 1 just because others had given it a 10. As far Im concerned its mine to give if I want to to give every a movie a 10 which by the way I dont. I am just sick of people telling me that a movie cant be great because it was story driven and not character driven maybe I like story driven movies I certainly liked this one. So heres another 10 for you movie snobs will have to eradicate.  no matter what your struggles may be in life. This film is part of my childhood now in my adult hood and hopefully something dear I can share with my children and their children. Until we all voyage into the west. positive,I have watched it three times and enjoyed it more than the previous viewing this is simple a marvelous movie. The ending is just fine and dont understand why some people didnt appreciate it i think its needed. I rate this 10/10 the trilogy will definitely be at my favorite movie collection list.positive,i have to say that i think people are being a bit harsh towards this movie i understand you are allowed youre own opinions but is it really that terrible that you feel the need to tell people not to watch it it really isnt a terrible movie theres action romance a great plot high quality special effects high quality acting by a great cast what more could you want? shailene does a wonderful job of portraying tris and how she has changed since the last film she clearly shows what is going on in her head the toll that losing her parents and killing one of her best friends is clearly shown by the way she acts she plays it spectacularly she makes the character feel real she makes it feel real and look real miles is hilarious he brings a comedy element to a film with quite tough themes and emotions in it theo does an amazing job of portraying a supportive yet tough four ansel portrays a weak cowardly caleb really well all of the acting is amazing i believe in many ways it stays true to the book it has the roughly the same basic plot with new added extras i believe that the way they changed it made it more interested as a film if they stuck with the original reason as to why jeanine was hunting divergents as a film i believe it would have been quite boring to see what they do in the film makes it interesting intriguing even i really do believe that people are saying too much harsh stuff about this movie it is interesting intriguing and has an amazing cast new and old the visual effects are amazing the acting is amazing it is worth a watch it doesnt matter if you watch it in 2d or 3d it is a good movie and i really enjoyed it fans will as wellpositive,i have to be honest when i saw the trailer i thought the film would be very monotonous so i was wonder if i would watch the film eventually i am started to watch the movie right from the first minute i thought it was really a great movie not only because i am super interested in what plays in space and i love very much adventure films but also because its a bit the real life of an astronaut describes the say goodbye to your family for example and not being able to promise when you come back and if you come back at all also i found that the film contained a lot of variety and by that i mean that there is always a different kind of problem came or the planet was not viable or the spaceship went piece i thought it was really super that they have made almost 3 hours full of excitement at the last 50 minutes it was really kind of mind f*ck because i didnt know how it could be that he was in a 5 dimensional space but good in other words i found a super movie and i really hope there is a interstellar 2 comespositive,I have to admit i did not see LOTR until a year ago or so but after i watched it i will never see a movie the same again. Peter Jacksonwith this movie proves himself as one of the greatest director of all times.and the result of that is that this movie is AWESOOMEAll the actors and actresses did a superbly good job also making the movie what it isOK but who i think really kills it in this movies is Andy Serkis.Andy Serkis as gollum is the best casting choice ever he did such a good job at making every scene he is in count especially the end scene and if youve scene the movie you know what i mean.So the lord of the rings is great i think it more than deserved all the Oscar wins it got and perfectly establishes itself as one of the greatest movies of all time.Ill give it a perfect  10 out of 10.  and Return of the King is the best of the bunch. Sometimes you love a film because of the performances the cinematography the direction or writing and even the music. But sometimes its just simply how it makes you feel. In this case: speechless. The performances are note perfect  particularly Sean Astin Andy Serkis and Sir Ian Mckellen. Jacksons direction is outstanding keeping the audience utterly gripped moved and overwhelmed for three hours. The special effects have started to date in places yet this is a thats film over 10 years old. And given the speed in which technology and CGI progress these days it says a lot that for the most part it can still compete against modern CGI output. The film trilogy and Return of the King in particular is a monumental achievement in film making never matched historically and unlikely to be bettered in the future. positive,I have three framed posters of my favourite films on my wall. On the left is The Dark Knight and on the right is The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King. These are the best films of their outstanding trilogies and in my opinion are the greatest films of my generation. I have watched each countless times because theyre filled with action suspense and tension and also incorporate a sense of overcoming that which seems impossible to overcome. Then purely because it was rated highly I watch a film not of my generation on a free DVD from the Sunday Times. Without special effects or a large budget The Shawshank Redemption became my third poster because it exceeds the qualities TDK and ROTK have in abundance. Each are excellent. Shawshanks better.positive,I have this film on DVD and its one of my favourites. That said its been several years since I sat down and watched it and I hoped it was still as good as I remembered. It might be worth pointing out here that Ive been a huge Stephen King fan since I was at school probably a good 30 years all told. I have every book in general circulation and Ive read a lot of them more than once. Different Seasons must have been one of the first books of his that I bought when it first came out way back in 82 or 83. Its a collection of four unrelated novellas other than that each title has a different season mentioned in the subtitle. The first of the novellas is Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption: Hope Springs Eternal and it is in my opinion by far the best. If you havent read it I would thoroughly recommend it particularly if you havent seen the film as the movie stuck pretty closely to the original story so there wont be many surprises in store for you otherwise. Incidentally if youve ever seen Rob Reiners movie Stand by Me or Bryan Singers Apt Pupil youll find two of the other stories in the collection pretty familiar too. But I digress back to the movie in question. I wasnt disappointed. This is undoubtedly a great movie and thoroughly deserves its place at the top of the list. The performances from Tim Robbins & Morgan Freeman are superb and the friendship between their characters develops over 20 years or so is entirely believable. You see them particularly Freeman get gradually broken and institutionalised as the film plays out. And then of course you get that fantastic feel- good ending that you really wanted but somehow never actually expected. But its not just the performances from Robbins and Freeman that delight. Both Bob Gunton the sadistic and greedy warden who somehow believes he is doing Gods work and Clancy Brown remember him as the Kurgan in Highlander as the equally sadistic almost sociopathic Captain Hadley give wonderfully sinister performances. Most of the other prisoners with the possible exception of James Whitmores Brooks are fairly two-dimensional but then the director almost seems to gloss over them deliberately to keep the viewers attention firmly directed towards the two leads and their developing bond. The film begins in the 1940s and continues on until the 1960s so it was essentially a period piece when it was made. This has stopped it becoming dated in any way. Also because its set in a prison which appears almost completely isolated from the outside word the passage of time is easy to miss. The movie is as engrossing now as it was 15+ years ago when it was first released. At two and quarter hours its probably one of the longer films in the list although by no means the longest but it keeps the viewers attention for the full duration and never seems to lose its sense of direction. Every scene pushes the plot forward in some way. A definite 10/10 from me and thoroughly recommended.positive,I have seen this movie about 6 times and I get stunned every time. Now has past one year since I last saw her so it got me thinkingpositive,I have seen this movie a few times. Each time with the same hope and enthusiasm as before. The main story is obviously Andys. His fears his hopes and dreams... his struggle to remain sane. As a rock hammer Andy chisels the prison around him. But this is more than the story of Andy and his way out of prison. Its a tale of society men trying to survive trying to remain human and civilized. Red is a gentleman masterfully played by on of the greatest actors ever. His character adds depth to the story and makes room for hope for friendship. All those around Andy benefit from his morals his intelligence his perseverance his will not to let go of himself. At first we see men with no hope no way out of their walls. Brooks is an unfortunate part of it. But Andy changes lives. Some study some begin to plan life outside the walls. Even the guards look up to a man as righteous as they come. Every time I see it I get the same warm feeling as the first time I saw it without actually knowing what it was what it is... Its only fitting it sits on top of the charts and if that makes people watch it its just enough as it will bring them the same feeling again and again. I movie to watch once a year or whenever you need a little pick-me-up.positive,I have seen The Shawshank Redemption twice now the second time being about a week ago. After the first time I saw it I gave it a perfect 10 rating on IMDb something I do very rarely Ive given out 20 ratings of 10 out of the 600+ movies Ive rated. However after just one viewing I felt so impacted by this film that it immediately rocketed near the top of my favorite movie list. After a second viewing I feel even more amazed by it than I was the first time I saw it. The movie captures your interest in the first scene and unfolds new plot points and character developments slowly at first and then more rapidly as the movie goes on. The movie runs about 130 minutes long but it never gets boring. While it is admittedly slow paced this only serves into its greatness. It allows the viewer to get to know the characters of Andy and Red and sympathize with thempositive,I have seen the movie for the first time. Its a wonderful film with excellent plot twists what gives a positive effect to the enjoying of the movie. Things are happening you dont expect and thats good for a movie. Its also a dark prison-film and i like that type of films. The voice of Morgan Freeman is also very nice and intimidating. The IMDb-rating is very high. I think the movie deserves it but i understand other people who are thinking that this movie is overrated. I think the reason why is that this movie has less haters then other movies like Pulp Fiction and so on... . One point can be better: the characters doesnt become older when the movie progresses. But a well-deserved 10/10.positive,I have seen The Lord of the Rings several times. Which of the three is the best Are the first two only because I know that there is still much to see. J. R. R. Tolkien was a genius of literature. He had a magnificent imagination Middle Earth is an invention of genius where nothing was left to chance. To adapt to The movie is fantastic Peter Jackson did a great job where everything is perfect. To adapt to The movie is fantastic Peter Jackson did a great job where everything is perfect. The responsibility of Peter Jackson to make these movies was great he was to adapt a great work of fiction for the screen but did well.positive,i have seen some movies in my life not much but some and most of them were good maybe there were a few i didnt like that much but interstellar man this movie is amazing wait not even amazing i cant find a word to describe how good it wasusually when i watch a movie i dont give it a rate just by i dont know just because of its story or special effects things like that but more on how i feel after watching iti have seen a few movies which people told me they are very good and they were also in the top but while watching them despite having a good story or something like that i had the feeling ohh god when it will end ? or meh its ok but not that amazing but while i was watching interstellar man i had that feeling that i really want to see whats going to happen that i wouldnt do anything else in that very moment and just wait to see what happens nextand there were moments that made me want to i dont know how to really say it participate in it for example i just felt the need to go and kill drmann for what he did and help cooper you know be a part of it of the moviethere were also some moments that really made me cry like when cooper saw his son and daughter after a lot of time or at the end when he saw his daughterin the end for me it was actually the best i have seen so far if only i could erase my memory of seeing it and watch it again i would watch it over and over again that good it wasi will personally give it a 10 out of 10 some might tell me that i am wrong but its my opinion and i really enjoyed itfor the others i really recommend watching it you wont regret it for surepositive,I have seen Pulp Fiction 67 Times till now. And i simply enjoy every time and i m a big fan of Quantine. I have seen all his Directorial movie except 4 Rooms.He is great & simply Talented as a Director & Actor. I like many scenes of Pulp Fiction few of my best are When Vincent inject it to understand were the extra money went...The plot when he first meet Mia..The Song U will be a women soon...And of course Samuel Ezeequi 25:17. Butch Killing Zed 5 Dollars Shake Bava Choko Madman Comfortable Silence Fox Force Five Gods Miracle Grand Father Watch Foot Massage Magic Marker Martin & Luise. Apart from every thing i simply liked all the characters of the movie including Tim RothMarcellasWolf & Zed.positive,i have seen many movies of rose and ben but this one will be added to my golden collections this is one kind where the story makes you fell what if a life saves turns out be a murderer and you cant find a way to get out of it slow thriller keeps once tight till the cast appears amazing screen play but still there were a bit of scope to be improved negligible flaws which are easily identifiable and they are illogical too a lot of good scenes will keep you enjoy watching the movie too many twist arent really made it bad many cases you will try to interrupt your own side of the story the moment you try to switch you will be brought back again to the same space where you were lost in one sentence after you watch this movie you will feel that you are saved but not safe with your loved one happy watching free advise do not watch it with your wife periodpositive,I have seen many movies in my time but it is ever so clear to me that this masterpiece deserves my final opinion. The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King is ground breaking to say the least and has been hailed as one of the greatest movies of all time and for great reason. It is movies like these that only come once in a great while and those who are there to enjoy the magic will not forget the impact that it brought to them. From the outstanding cast to the amazing visual effects to the beautiful musical  Peter Jackson has truly reminded us why we all watch movies in the first place. The Return of the King has made its place in history as a landmark movie and for others it may have become something more.positive,I have seen a lot of great films in my day and in my opinion this is one of if not the best film ever made. Peter Jackson does an amazing job as a director. He creates the siege of minas tirith perfectly. He uses the best effects that money can buy and they look fantastic. Having nasgul fly down and rip a trebuchet off a massive wall is true cinematic art. On top of this there is an epic story that everyone can fallow. Every time I view this movie I am amazed by what I see. I am entertained begging to end. This is by far the best film of the series which is also amazing to watch begging to end. 11 well deserved academy awards for LOTR RTK including best picture and best director. If your a movie fan then watching the Lord of the Rings series is a must.positive,i have not been an angelina jolie fan but she was superb in this movie i absolutely loved the movie i enjoyed it so much that ive seen it twice already and plan to purchase the movie as soon as it comes out on dvd the movie is a new take on the story of sleeping beauty and it is very well done the acting is good and angelina steals the show with her portrayal of maleficient if your looking for a movie that guys and girls with both love this it the special effects are breath taking and the writing is excellent i cannot say enough good things about this movie this is one of those movies that you will want to see again and againpositive,I have no doubts as to what the best movie of all time is: Pulp Fiction Cool slick witty violent clever fun exciting cool cool and cool Twenty years on Quentin Tarantinos Pulp Fiction has been rereleased in cinemas and it looks as mesmeric and mad as ever: callous insolent breathtaking The icy wit the connoisseur soundtrack the violence of which the N-bombs are a part the extended dialogue riffing the trance-like unreality the inspired karmic balance of the heroin scene and the adrenalin scene the narrative switchbacks that allow John Travolta to finish the film both alive and dead the spectacle of him being made to dance badly but also sort of brilliantly Š—_ above all else the sheer directionless excitement that only Tarantino can conjure In 1994 it broke over my head like a thunderclap and in 1990s Britain this touchstone of cool seemed to extend its dangerous influence everywhere: movies fiction journalism media fashion restaurants you name it Everyone was trying to do irony and incorrectness but without his brilliance it just looked smug The Americans get Tarantinopositive,I have never seen such an amazing film since I saw The Shawshank Redemption. Shawshank encompasses friendships hardships hopes and dreams. And what is so great about the movie is that it moves you it gives you hope. Even though the circumstances between the characters and the viewers are quite different you dont feel that far removed from what the characters are going through. It is a simple film yet it has an everlasting message. Frank Darabont didnt need to put any kind of outlandish special effects to get us to love this film the narration and the acting does that for him. Why this movie didnt win all seven Oscars is beyond me but dont let that sway you to not see this film let its ranking on the IMDbs top 250 list sway you let your friends recommendation about the movie sway you. Set aside a little over two hours tonight and rent this movie. You will finally understand what everyone is talking about and you will understand why this is my all time favorite movie.positive,I have never seen a perfect movie and did not know there could be such a thing. But this is it. I have always been a Batman fan. But this was so much more than a comic book movie. It was an epic. Even if had nothing to do with the character we know and love it would still have an excellent story. Its suspenseful funny terrifying heartwarming. It literally has everything you could want from a movie. And it seems REAL. The Batmobile didnt look like a bat it looked like a tank able to withstand anything. Plus it held the Batpod. How awesome was that And the Joker Heath Ledger may he rest in peace did absolutely some of the best acting I have ever ever seen. He WAS the Joker. Not some cheesy bad guy. He was a REAL psychopath. He was both hilarious and terrifying. And his objective was to cause chaos. Not greed. Just to wreak havoc on Gotham City and especially on Batman. And the whole story is phenomenal. Its over two and a half hours long yet it doesnt seem like it at all. You never want it to end. It starts with a bang and never slows down. And the armored car chase Easily the best car chase ever put on film. I watched this movie three times in the theater. Ive never done that. And I love movies. Great story great REAL effects the only CGI in the entire movie was Two-Face and Im glad Christopher Nolan did that right and not Like Tommy Lee Jones and the acting - top notch across the board. I cant wait to see how how Nolan tops this because you know he will this. I cant believe it didnt even get a nod for best picture. A shame. At least Ledger won. He deserved every bit of the hype. He and Nolan both went above and beyond all expectations.positive,I have never liked batman as a character... Old movies were OK but not that good... Until Christian Bale came... This movie is the reason why Batman is one of my favorite characters ever... The plot the direction the acting... Heath Ledger RIP is amazing... An excellent movie indeed The movies that follow are better and better...The way the movie trilogy shows the development of characters is amazing... I was astonished when at the end of The Dark Knight Rises how Robin is born... Who is Catwoman Two-Faces and others... I am planning to watch Gotham - the Series now because of this movie... Thank you everyone for making Batman the coolest character everpositive,i have never grinned for the entire length of a movie before i watched guardians ok i admit it im a huge comic book fan and i believe i spotted many of the referenced in the first viewing however this film is pure joy it is joyful because it is part of the marvel universe? hell yeah it is joyful because it deserves to be part of the marvel universe and it respect the marvel universe and its source material can people that are unfamiliar with the marvel universe enjoy this film? i presume so however the more important question is how can anyone not be familiar with the marvel universe give the parade of pureawesome films that marvel has created since iron man? if you want to see a film go and watch this one its pure fun and it deserves to be enjoyedpositive,I have never been a fan of fantasy nor have I read the Lord of the Rings novel when virtually everyone did in high school. I knew many people loved the book to the extreme but I never gave it a second thought. However the films that were translated from Tolkien were magnificent in particular this concluding one This trilogy is about as perfect as we can ever expect from movie-making and I was even sad to see it end. Wouldnt it be great to see movies like this come out every year Weve certainly been spoiled by this one thats for sure I relished in the action adventure romance and mythology of this series. The music cinematography characters and scope make this trilogy one for the ages. Even if you are not a fan of fantasy like me do yourself a favor and go on the Rings journeypositive,I have never been a fan of comic book superheroes but this one was amazing. It blew me away when I watched it for the first time. Christopher Nolan has created another master piece. Nolan showed what I was looking for in a Super Hero moviepositive,I have lost count of the amount of time I have watched this film. I enjoy watching all of Quentin Tarantinos films but this has to be one of my favourite. There is plenty of action and bad language they just dont make films like this anymore. Tarantinos films have garnered both critical and commercial success. He has received many industry awards including two Academy Awards two Golden Globe Awards two BAFTA Awards and the Palme dOr and has been nominated for an Emmy and a Grammy. He was named one of the 100 Most Influential People in the World by Time in 2005[4] and filmmaker and historian Peter Bogdanovich has called him the single most influential director of his generationpositive,I have just returned from a premiere in Newcastle Australia15/7/08 let me just say this has to be one of the best movies of 2008. Every performance in this movie is just fantastic and Heath Ledger Owns The JOKER I dont think anyone could match his style and he eats up every scene he is in. This has to be scene on the big screen to be enjoyed this is one of the very few sequels that is better than the original. Make 2008 the year to see and enjoy one of the years best. And i hope in Feb 09 Heath is nominated for an Oscar he will always be remembered Cheerspositive,i have just finished watching boyhood and i can just simply say that it is one the greatest films i have seen in a long time the cast who portray the characters are excellent and play there roles superbly one character i was drawn to from the out skirts and through out was mason mason is a very relate able character in my opinion especially if you are a boy of that age and have experienced the things mason did throughout the film it wasnt just the cast i enjoyed however the story it self was pure film brilliance the fact that it took the majority of 12 years to record makes this film an extra bit special the best part about this film for me is how the film highlights the key landmarks and events of a parents and childs life span together as a family i would defiantly recommend this film to anyonepositive,I have grown up watching Bollywood movies full of overacting by overpaid overfed heroes. It was in college that i got to see some fine Hollywood films and this one was probably the finest of the lot. This film at first appears to be a story about life in prison. It fully describes every small experience of a person serving a long prison sentence. Life is not easy there for a lot of reasons. The screenplay is ably supported by Morgan Freemans brilliant narration offering a second-person view of life in shawshank. But Tim Robbins steals the show by aptly underplaying the part of a wrongly sentenced wealthy banker.The last forty minutes of this film however help raise it a couple of levels above other cinematic masterpieces. You dont need a weapon to fight. It is easy to take away a mans bread even his freedom but impossible to take away his hope.positive,I have been into movies since well I was 5. But after about 15 years I finally was lucky enough to come across this title. I had a huge expectation when I started watching it.Hey it aint number 1 for show that much i can vouch for. Well it took me a few minutes to get into it but well once i got engulfed it was just sheer pleasure and goosebumps. The film revolves around the inmates of a prison and a NEW FISH accused of homicide joining the faculty.The film depicts How he changed their lives and helped them to realize and bring back the greatest gift of life taken away from them . The friendship the hardship the simplest joy the tragedies  the yearning for freedom in each breath has been brilliantly acted and directed.The movie makes you feel good.After watching it it makes you smile and strengthens your faith in humanity.I am no critic but this movie made me happy ecstatic and I would love to re-watch it again and again. so i would say go on watch it at once if you have not. You will love it no matter what your taste in films are. Because this film expresses humanity in each way possible. And as a fellow human being you will love the emotions. If you dont then well I will be a bit surprised. P.S 1994 was the year of Forrest Gump. It took home all the awards. Though it is a great film but in my opinion it remains only great while shawshank is one of the greatest if not the greatest movie of all times. Thank You...  Gimli a Dwarf warrior  Legolas an Elven prince  and Gandalf a Wizard. The work was initially intended by Tolkien to be one volume of a two- volume set the other to be The Silmarillion but this idea was dismissed by his publisher.For economic reasons The Lord of the Rings was published in three volumes over the course of a year from 29 July 1954 to 20 October 1955 thus creating the Lord of the Rings trilogy. The three volumes were entitled The Fellowship of the Ring The Two Towers and The Return of the King. Structurally the novel is divided internally into six books two per volume with several appendices of background material included at the end of the third volume. Some editions combine the entire work into a single volume. The Lord of the Rings has since been reprinted numerous times and translated into many languages. Tolkiens work has been the subject of extensive analysis of its themes and origins. Although a major work in itself the story was only the last movement of a larger epic Tolkien had worked on since 1917 in a process he described as mythic. Influences on this earlier work and on the story of The Lord of the Rings include philology mythology religion and the authors distaste for the effects of industrialization as well as earlier fantasy works and Tolkiens experiences in World War I. The Lord of the Rings in its turn is considered to have had a great effect on modern fantasy  the impact of Tolkiens works is such that the use of the words Tolkienian and Tolkienesque have been recorded in the Oxford English Dictionary. The enduring popularity of The Lord of the Rings has led to numerous references in popular culture the founding of many societies by fans of Tolkiens worksand the publication of many books about Tolkien and his works. The Lord of the Rings has inspired and continues to inspire artwork music films and television video games and subsequent literature. Award-winning adaptations of The Lord of the Rings have been made for radio theater and film. positive,i have been a cinema lover for years read a lot of reviews on imdb and everywhere and never found the right movie to write my first review i always thought i would wait for the movie and this is it when i first heard that nolan was preparing a scifi movie i felt like a kid again waiting for his christmas gift under the tree i knew it would become a classic and im sure it will first of all it is incredibly beautiful to watch honestly it was so beautiful that i felt like i was sucked into the movie the way nolan decided to show some scenes really remind me of 2001 a space odyssey actually many things will probably remind you of this movie we can feel the talent of christopher nolan just by looking at the way it is filmed the techniques he used contribute to create that visual environment in a believable way the sound environment is just mesmerizing it is a very important part of the movie because some scenes take place in space and noland just found the right way to use sound the soundtrack made by the great hans zimmer is breathtaking epic amazing unreal i could find a lot more adjectives to qualify it but you have to hear it to understand how epic they are these two important parts image and sound create a stunning atmosphere you will forget you are in a movie theater and you will be lost in space sucked into the adventures of this new space odyssey begging for more it is a truly unique experience i can say that i have never felt something like that in a movie theater at least not for the past ten years then of course the cast first of all matthew mcconaughey i discovered this actor in tropic thunder but he didnt really convince me though he was quite funny then i saw dallas buyers club since that movie i love him in this movie well he is the movie i exaggerate a bit since there are other great actors some even unexpected with a special guest who play extremely well but he is just what was needed to feel the human part of the story which is very important in interstellar he is capable of making us feel so many different emotions all along the story as a father as a human anne hathaway was very convincing all together the actors managed to create some harmony which makes the human interactions credible caine chastaing and affleck are a perfect choice and then there is the special guest i will call him x his role which could be seen as a minor role is actually much more important than that he proves once again that he is a great actor watch and see and finally the scenariostory i wont spoil anything here ill just try to convince you how great it is nolan is known to revolutionize everything when he tries a new genre in cinema well once again he did it with the dark knight he revolutionized the superhero genre with interstellar hes revolutionizing the scifi genre in cinema from what i heard he worked with a physicist in gravitational physics and astrophysics to help him with that movie and we can feel and see it during the fifties asimov laid the foundations of modern science fiction lucas and kubrick did the same in cinema today nolan is laying the new foundations of the genre in cinema proving that cinema is still at the beginning of what can be done brace yourselves my friends we have not seen anything yet why? well simply because we only know a few things about space some things cant be proved for the moment so we can use theory and make the best of it that is exactly what nolan did he used theories that exist today and made a movie about mankind about pioneers about humanity about us because in spite of all the scifi aspect it is a story about humanity mcconaughey hathaway and mainly x will managed to convince you about that my rating for this movie can only be a 10 because in itself it is a beginning for a new kind of cinema it is a classic those who say we cant compare this movie to 2001 space odyssey nor can we compare nolan to kubrick are wrong we can and we should talented people dont live only in the past some genius live today among us and nolan is one of them many say that he is overrated i truly dont think so only time will answer that this is the scifi movie of the decade and probably the best movie nolan ever made just go for it without a second thoughtpositive,i hadnt seen any Tarantino movie before pulp fiction but this one totally blew me away a truly unique style of film making coupled with some brilliant performances whats most remarkable is that all the parts fit together so well you almost get a feeling of eureka plus the music of pulp fiction is its biggest strength going so well with whats playing on screen its almost as if youre witnessing the scene in first person theres great chemistry between the lead actorstravolta and Jackson excellent camera-work and a lot of minor details that caught my attention only in a second viewingthe banter between the characters feels so real at times you forget youre watching a movie pulp fiction is not just a film its an experience  a lesson in the art of film making Tarantino captures every emotion of his characters so well you develop a closeness with them and of course a liking for them in the end its about projecting the realities of life in a fashionable relatable way and this Tarantino does with grace and control positive,I had the honor of watching TDK during a screening and was completely blown away This isnt just the best Batman movie ever made this is one of the best movie ever made. Everything in this film is excellent not one piece of annoyance. Bale marvels as Bruce Wayne/Batman Ledger has made The Joker in to an iconic movie villain. His performance belongs there at the top with Hopkins Lecter. The Joker has finally been portrait properly on film he has earned his place between the big boys in movie villandom. This is the true Joker every Batman fan knows loves and fears. Ledger deserves any and every movie award known to man for this brilliant display. Nolan has made his I will always be remembered movie this is the crownjewel in his portfolio. Perfect directing perfect story perfect balance between action and drama everything is perfect. Even if you hate Batman you will love this film. If you dont then something beez wrongz with youzpositive,I had the fortune of seeing this at a drive in movie theater. Unfortunately I was also shooting a commercial for that drive in but I did most of my shooting before the movie even started. It was a great experience. I did however go to see it again in a proper theater environment. My cars speakers just werent up to task. I understand not everyone will get it either the story or Christian Bales voice or all the unbelievable action sequences and chain of events. I think they forget that ultimately this is a movie based on comic book characters. Everything about it is fantastical. This movie is amazing on every level. Great writing the performances are all convincing the effects realistic and the parallels to events in our own world jarring. The cinematography is beautiful and the moral dilemmas the personal struggles all relate to the events occurring in the film. There are some who fail to understand the symbolism of Batman and what it means to Bruce Wayne. Why they ask would Bruce Wayne in this film want to lay down the cowl for good Think about peace within yourself and what it means for those around you. How it affects the world around you. Therein lies the answer. Simple enough. There are lots of things to appreciate about this movie - at the very least just enjoy the exhilarating action scenes and suspense.positive,I had read all the Tolkien books long before this beautifully done set of films were made. I did not see the first two films in the theater as I am not much of a movie goer. I did see them on DVD and liked them very much. The sound quality in the first two was my only complaint I found it difficult to hear what the actors were saying at times but in this final film that seemed much improved. Of course this final part of the tale is less dialog and more action so that may explain the improved effect it may also be because I saw this in the theater and the sound is better quality than my little TV gives. I was enchanted with the whole finale of the tale. I was glad that the ending was not changed to much though I liked the struggle to save the shire at the end of the book the movie was getting long and the tale stood without that piece. I hope we can look forward to The Hobbit some day by this same group of people it will make my DVD collection complete. I hope many people will read these books now because creativity and imagination need to be developed on well written works like this. I am sure Mr. Tolkien would have been pleased.positive,i had not heard about gone girl before september 2014 i discovered it when i decided to check david finchers filmography one day a new fincher movie? awesome were the thoughts that flew through me unfortunately i didnt get to see it in theatres but i did get to see it after a while the story is dark and superbly crafted it is rare to find a story with such a simple premise yet such a complex execution youll second guess yourself every scene to what is going on yet you will always be wrong the acting is also really great with affleck and pike giving truly great performances and yes i had no problem with tyler perry the  by trent reznor & atticus ross was great as always and of course the direction by david fincher is superb it is rare to find a director as great as him working today overall this movie is great and should not be missed but be warned this movie is quite disturbingpositive,I had heard a lot about this movie being a classic and a must-see and normally that negatively impacts my view of a movie because unrealistic expectation often ruins the true quality of a movie. This movie however managed to surpass all my expectations. I didnt know much concerning the story except that it was a movie set in a prison but its so much more than that. The major theme that became apparent to me throughout this movie was how we regard as good and evil is largely dependent on the storyteller and how he chooses to paint the heroes/villains. Convicted felons are not usually considered heroes or people that you root for and want to succeed but the story is about so much more than that. The Shawshank Redemption is about hope and more importantly the struggle to maintain it when the world is doing its best to crush it. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freemans on-screen chemistry is amazing. There are no weak scenes no wasted dialogue. They are the best things about the movie they make you believe they make you hope.positive,i had been looking forward to this movie since i heard it was being made the cast was superb the director needed no introduction and the subject matter fascinating when i finally saw this film i was blown away i absolutely loved every second of it i am not one for going to a movie and scrutinising every frame when i go to the cinema i buy nachos and a coke and i enjoy getting involved in the story as long as it is good of course and this movie was so much more than good interstellar was one of these times where i got totally taken in by the story i had forgotten i was in the cinema and nolan had put me in the movie along with the brilliant mcconaughey the way nolan takes you through this film is truly enjoyable one that requires your full attention and theres no problem there as interstellar grabbed mine from start to finish great moviepositive,i grew up watching the cartoon version of cinderella so when disney released the reallife version i eagerly went to watch it it was an absolutely fantastic movie from beginning to end the short frozen scene at the beginning was a really nice touch actually i walked into the cinema with average expectations but was stunned by just how good it was lets start with the cast lily james is absolutely perfect for the role of cinderella her portrayal of innocence and kindness was fantastic she looked amazing and pulled off the role perfectly cate blanchett was perfect for the role of the evil stepmother i could actually feel her hatred towards cinderella throughout the movie richard madden as the prince was also brilliant because his romance with ella felt real and not forcedmany a time ive seen a movie where the lead relationship looks forced finally the cgi was spot on it made the movie feel magical and it also gave the movie a nice touch so in conclusion i recommend everyone to watch this movie because we all need a little magic in lifepositive,I got to see The Dark Knight on Wednesday night the reason though why Im writing this movie comment this late is because I didnt wanna just jump and say this movie was awesome I wanted to think it through still today I cant stop thinking about this movie The Dark Knight lives up to its hype and goes beyond it this is the Batman movie that goes where no other Batman movie has gone before. It gave us a real sold story we are finally told why the villains are the way they are how all the injustice in the world can get underneath Batmans skin how you have to believe that people still have faith in good on Earth. Heath Ledger I absolutely loved Jack Nicolsons performance in the 1989 film when I first read that Heath was signed onto The Dark Knight I was like What are they kidding once you see The Dark Knight... Heath was incredible Im not going to compare Jack and Heaths performance because they were two different versions of the Joker but Heaths Joker was definitely the more scary and intense of the two nominations. You didnt know what he was going to do next he was so crazy he was also so charismatic to the point where you could relate to his character and the worst part is not only that hes crazy hes driving Gotham crazy and treating everyone like little puppets on strings that he can control and guess what he is doing it so well with a smile on his face. This was so much more than a Batman film this was so much more than a comic book film The Dark Knight truly delivers with drama action romance horror dark humor the study of a psychopathic killer a detective story. The force behind this epic movie is Christopher Nolan whos previous film Batman Begins didnt really thrill me but his incredible film making is truly shown in The Dark Knight the shots that he got of Gotham City were absolutely fantastic and made you feel part of the city part of the Batman story. One of the things that I absolutely loved about The Dark Knight is that normally with a comic book movie you know its not real people dont dress up in costumes and save the day villains dont name themselves crazy names and dress in make up or crazy costumes but The Dark Knight actually makes it seem incredibly real like it could happen. Bruce Wayne is still learning how to be in his double life of Batman and himself he has lost Rachel to the new district attorney Harvey Dent hes inspiring others who are dressing up as Batman and are trying to take on the villains of the city themselves. But things are much worse when the Joker waltzes into town and hes going to bring Hell upon Gotham City. Constantly playing with Gothams mind and trying to get Batman to reveal himself Batman has never dealt with such a psychopathic genius before. The Joker has named himself as the Classy Villain that Gotham needs he also has brought a new thought into Batmans head of them actually being more alike than different that Batman completes him the Joker would be nothing without him. But Batman is relying on Harvey Dent who is Gothams White Knight trying to put all of Gothams scum in jail. But when the Joker plays Batman and Commissioner Gordon Harvey and Rachel find themselves in very horrific position and Harvey must discover if he will die a hero or live long enough to become a villain. All the performances are dead on in this movie now everyones going crazy over Heath Ledgers performance but one performance I would also love to credit is Aaron Eckhart who plays Harvey Dent/Two Face his performance was just as great as Heaths and made Two Face a human villain. You could understand his hatred and vengeance on what happened to him and why he became Two Face. I know that everyone is saying this but I truly mean when I say this is one of the best movies I have seen in a very long time. We had some great movies these past few years but I think The Dark Knight is seriously something special but I dont wanna build it up too much since some people go to the theater expecting my words to be the same as your own. In my opinion though this is not a great movie I cant come up with a word describe how incredibly powerful this movie was to be honest I would go above a 10 rating if I couldpositive,I first watched the LOTR Trilogy when I was 13 y/o. It was my fathers favorite movie. Back then I was not able to understood fully what it is all about but I liked it. I did not love it like I loved Harry Potter back then but I liked it. Entering High School I have gotten the chance to re-watch the whole trilogy again and again and again and this time I absolutely loved it. I became obsessed with the story. Tolkien created a beautiful world and wrote about this amazing characters. We see each of the characters growth as we followed their journey up to the end. The cinematography of all movies are spot on. The sound was done beautifully and the actors gave life to one of the most-loved characters of all time. The Return of The King concludes the story of Middle-Earth having peace back in their world. We know that CGI can both be the angel and the demon at the same time but with this film it was done just right. This truly elevated my standard with films. The quality was spectacular and truly a timeless piece.  a good director a thrilling history that you want to involve in yourself good directed action scenes romantic histories that has its turning points in the main story a good cast and good assistants. And its a great video version based on a great book. and that arent always so easy to manage especially not when the book its based on is so full of action and details so thumbs up for Peter Jackson and his crew = The actors are a chapter for itself who keeps the story so living thrilling and amazing the whole movie. They does an amazing job and I thinks nobody can deny that. The people that got the job for the costumes also did an incredible job dressing the actors so they looked like elves men dwarfs Orcs Moria goblins hobbits and other fantasy creatures + those who computer animated all of the trolls Ents servants of the dark master the dark master himself the flame Deamon from the old ages and all of that stuff. Im feeling that Ive said my opinion about this subject if eleven Oscars has not positive,I first saw this film like many others by chance and on DVD. And like others I have since watched it over and over again. When I feel sad it makes me feel happy when I need hope it gives me hope.When I want to reaffirm my very belief in life and all it can offer this film gives me a new sense of purpose that no other film has ever come close to doing.It soars above anything any other movie has tried to achieve in the way it touches on the true virtues of life itself. The portrayal of friendship the devastation of loss and the maintaining of hope. Outstanding performances from the two leads and the most beautiful of narratives are the tip of the iceberg of why this film is so great. The cinematography from the very first shots of the prison are stunning and the accompanying soundtrack add to the haunting atmosphere when we first venture inside the prison walls. Thank you Mr Darabont Mr Robins and Mr Freeman. Thank you to every one else involved. You changed my lifepositive,i first heard of interstellar in october 2013 and managed to avoid all information about this film until seeing this watching the teaser trailer released in november 2013 just moments before heading to the imax to get an idea of the story what i was not prepared for was the scale of the film and the story this film is really a must see and only when you see it will you understand that statement a lot of the complaints with this film has been with the plot and not understanding the science behind it the science behind it was easy for me to understand considering i have an a levels in physics but all the concepts you need to understand and know in order to follow story is all there and is repeatedly gone over throughout the film in one form or another the last third of the film made use of these concepts to provide a very unique take on the corner of physics this movie is situated in in the process it offered an exhilarating twist for scifi fans who managed to follow the physics the heart of the film really lies in the  and acting though sensational work all around the board and matthew mcconoughay delivers some truly outstanding moments of raw emotion throughout the film ive choose to give little away in this review but if you havent seen the film and are worried that the science may trouble you fear not  searching on youtube for a quick beginners guide to general relativity in relation to time and gravity should give you everything you need to know for the concepts which make up this film again i got that interstellar would be using these concepts from the teaser trailer so it really isnt a spoiler to say you may want to fill yourself in on that if you feel you may need to my brother has not sat a levels yet and his experience to this film was different from mine as he struggled to keep with the concepts this film has made so vital to its story this seems to be a common complaint for everyone who did not like this movie  but after explaining the physics to him he re saw the movie and his feelings changed to fall in line with mine i walked out of this film feeling like this was the best experience of my life at the cinema but i have waited over a month to share my review to see if that statement holds true and if my feelings toward the movie has dulled i am pleased to say it has not  even with the release of fury which i have seen after watching interstellar and also lovedpositive,I find something new to like about Pulp Fiction every time I see it. Shocking intelligent exciting hilarious and oddly though-provoking. Best bit: Jacksons Bible quote Harvey Keitel the Gimp or is it the watch dream Two hours of highlights.positive,i entitle my review a new hope as i walk out of the cinema feeling like i have just watched the star wars of our generation as a huge marvel fan both comics and film i was delighted to hear this film was getting made with the perfect choice of guardians and what a perfect cast to play them the biggest surprise for me was dave bautista who i thought was only cast for his size but his delivery was spot on for drax chris pratt was hilarious whilst still excellent at delivering some of the films most emotional scenes cgi in this film was super theres nothing i hate more than too much cgi in a film but it was so good in guardians that i was completely lost in it never have a seen space look so good the battles were incredible and groot and rocket never looked out of place aside from being a tree and raccoon gunn is the perfect director for this his tone his balance of comedy action and emotion blended perfectly and directing gotg would have been no easy job dc are still trying hard to get justice league going marvel just made a film with a talking tree and raccoon and it was awesome not a bad performance all round and comic fans will be happy with certain nods and winks scattered throughout probably my top marvel film yet it has the fresh new feeling the first iron man had with all the action and humour of the avengers 10 stars from me even if your not a comic book or scifi fan this movie has something for everyonepositive,I ended up watching the film this year and its now one of my favorites of all time. John Travolta and Samuel L Jackson play their characters phenomenally and they work really well together. Also theres so many memorable lines in the film. Director Quentin Tarantino adds to the list of great movies by executing another spectacular film. This movie is a real one of a kind type of film well I believe at least. Uma Thurman does a stunning job she brought an entire new aspect to her character her character seems very independent and is quite likable. I have personally recommended this film to a variety of different people and I believe it can be enjoyed by film lovers of any genre.  Pulp Fiction. Its pertaining to old comic book strips usually containing lurid subject matter with a modern day twist. The film conveys this perfectly through the eyes of characters: Vince Jules and Butch played by Travolta Jackson and Willis. The non-linear time sequence also allows the audience to become more submerged in the multilateral plot by understanding how each characters actions eventually effect anthers causing the plot to intertwine narratives. The cool 1950s - 1970s rock n roll music also saturates the film in a cool and eccentric atmosphere which is then juxtaposed with gratuitous violence sexual violence and drug themes. This feeling is perfectly described by one scene of Travoltas character Vincent driving a cherry red convertible cadillac down a road at high speed with Mia Wallace Uma Thurman overdosing on heroin in the back seat. This is how the film makes you feel when it reaches its climax. On the other hand the relief comes with witty dialogue and great humour which makes you think about pop culture and society. The whole film is an absolute ride and my favourite of all time. positive,i dont usually write reviews but this movie blew me away it was amazing in so many ways the animation for one was beautiful and intense watching maleficent fly was emotional and inspiring i couldnt help but think how amazing this movie must have been in the theater this movie was humorous in its own special way maleficents personality was both emotional and hilarious at times i found myself laughing a lot and really feeling all of her emotions throughout the movie this is a great movie for everyone i cant say enough how well done this movie was it had every element i enjoy and the characterscharacter growth was well done this movie kept me anticipating what was to come next the entire timepositive,I dont think Ive ever seen a finer super hero movie in quite some time. This has everything in it. Action suspense thrills. Anything you want in a action film its here. The reason why this movie stands out among the rest is because not only was Nolan making a super hero movie he was trying to make a regular movie. Theres also the astounding performance by Heath Ledger as the Joker. Its the down right best portrayal of the Joker at least live action wise Mark Hammills voice acting is quite amazing as well. This honestly is the best action and super hero movie made in quite some time and I just hope that more super hero movies take this as a starting point and try to make them at least this good.positive,i dont know why this movie is getting so many hateful reviews i thought the direction was awesome the acting was awesome and the story was awesome the movie was a great adaptation of the human relationship condition and its effects on us from beginning to end i was glued to the movie entranced by the events and the music ben afflecks performance was very impressive and it has made me even more excited about his upcoming role of batman in superman vs batman i think its best to watch this movie without knowing anything about the plot thats how i did when i told someone about the movie they said oh you mean the one with the kidnapped chick i stopped wasting my time telling them anything because if someone told me that before i watched i would have had a completely different perspective of the moviepositive,I dont have enough space here to point out all of the misconceptions about Pulp Fiction so Ill just give everybody my take on the film and its message Pulp Fiction is a truly brilliant film that few people will ever completely understand Pulp Fiction covers everything from social satire to morality to just good old fashion movie fun First of all I would like to explain the bible verse that Jules reads Ezekeil 25:17 and how it applies to the story Jules is the righteous man Vincent is the selfish and Marsellus represents the tyranny of evil men Jules is beset on all sides by this negativity and must find it in himself to overcome it Jules in the end finds redemption where Vince and Marsellus have the vengance of the lord layed upon them for their sins This is just one layer of a great story Perhaps thats the brilliance of Pulp Fiction: the various layers that the film can be enjoyed on Pulp Fiction is the Citizen Kane of the 90sIt has changed filmaking like few others The acting in Pulp Fiction makes it seem like the actors were just born to play their roles in the movie Uma Thurman and Samuel L Jackson give a couple of the finest performances in screen history The Social satire and Quentins great direction only fuel the fire Its just too bad that the subject matter of the film turn people away from Pulp Fiction because those people are really restricting themselves Pulp Fiction is my all-tie favorite film and I believe that in 10 or 15 years it will go down as the greatest film ever made 10 out of 10positive,I dont easily remember the names of actors of Hollywood movies neither do I ever take the time off writing comments on any movie but for this movie i have to do it all. The whole way of presenting this movie has been outstanding i.e. from the beginning to the end. Great performances Tim Robbins & Freeman Qualifying as one my favorite actors. The whole presentation has been very apt to the movie. But what is important is the strong message this movie transcends i.e. of Hope is truly recommendable. This movie deserves an intent watch by all. Do take you some time off to watch the movieif not twice be it once.positive,i dont come here that much i write even less reviews but this movie its incredible the script characters story effects i was forced to come here and compliment everyone involved in it it will be hard to come back to the cinema to see any other hero movie pros everything it was so funny throughout the movie filled up with action incredible scenes i even think that the effects surpass dawn of the apesi mean i now love that raccoon more than batman cons i think that the action  close combat scenes could have been better they werent bad but i didnt see gamora as deadly as she should have been besides this its a flawless movie thats the reason for the 10 its difficult to do something just this perfect to close it up thanks to everyone involved in doing this masterpiecepositive,I dont care if there are some poor souls who would like to belittle this film. Just think of these misfits as beyond redemption. I saw this film in 1995 and still vividly felt the euphoria of the final half hour which stayed with me for a couple of weeks. I was convinced this was the best film I had ever seen in my life even better than Akira Kurosawas Ran and One flew over the cuckoos nest which was my all time favorite until TSR came along. I excitedly contacted my best friend who shared the same passion and he confirmed my thoughtsthis must be the best film Ive ever seen But it is sad though that I will probably never see a better film for the rest of my life as I have seen the best. In music I have heard the best in Rush and Jackson Browne which made others pale in comparison and in movies I have TSR. Hail Frank Darabontpositive,I do not know how many times I thought this film was finished and it was not - although it took a while to get into it the ending was so exceptional I`ve watched it time and time again. There were so many twists I was not expecting - the author should be applaudedpositive,I do not even feel as though I need to go into a great amount of detail to explain just how amazing this film is. Youve probably seen the movie sitting on the top spot of IMDBs top 250 or maybe youve heard a friend babble on about how great the movie is and know it must be half-decent. I can assure you this will live up to your expectations. The acting the plot the setting the cast the directing the messages and symbols the acting again deserves another mention is just about as perfect as a movie can be in this setting. Please dont waste your time pondering over whether or not to see this movie or whether or not you should believe the hype because I can assure you you can. Go buy this from your local movie store or buy it online - I really dont care - just make sure you watch this film before anything else. As an 18-year-old guy I can say with confidence this is the best movie I have ever seen - or ever will see. Go watch it Nowpositive,I didnt think Tarantino could possibly top Reservoir Dogs but here he is only two years later outdoing himself with Pulp Fiction a bigger budget than Reservoir but still small by Hollywood standards The film is a masterpiece winning Tarantino the Oscar for original screenplay and getting well deserved nominations for Best Picture Director Actor Travolta Supp Actor Jackson and Supp Actress Thurman My one complaint is that many people who rent the video are missing out on some of the joys of the film because most of the videos are cropped so that you cant see the whole screen the way you did in the theatre For example when drug dealer Eric Stoltz is in bed watching TV before Travolta calls him letting him know he and Uma are on their way over you see a box of funny looking breakfast cereal some outdated brand that Stoltz is eating In the video you cant see it and you miss out on one of the funny sight gags Tarantino has in store for you Its little details like these that help make Pulp Fiction a treasure to view long after the initial impact of the stories wears off The films style has been ripped off but only the Coen Bros Fargo has come close to bringing us the same off beat pleasures As the years go on movie fans will be more and more surprised to learn Pulp Fiction did not win for Best Picturepositive,I didnt see the film in the cinema because I was too young at 14 though when I did rent it on video and subsequently DVD it was and is still to this day the best movie I have ever hired out and Now I have the DVD with all the extras it makes a truly memorable film that much complete. Its true what they say about this having an impact on peoples lives as it did me. From the moment it starts and you start to hear the narration of Morgan Freeman you know there is something special to this film. The films message of hope even in the most dark situations hope can be our salvation and it is so true. The film is put together perfectly what brings the film together for me is Morgan Freemans voice its so powerful in his acting on screen in the film as well as his narration. There are two best scenes for me most powerful is Reds 3rd parole hearing it sums up total acceptance of what hes done and he can be open to them about how he truly feels without a care or worry in the world. The second is when Red finds the Box under the Oak Tree and the whole story seems to come together at that point. The way time progresses is an essential aspect in this film and thats another excellent example you see of Andy and the Warden almost becoming partners in crime and they develop this close bond. Prison Drama No that description doesnt give this film justice its a pure masterpiece and if you havent seen it I would advise buy a copy now you wont be disappointed. Even after 50 or so viewings I still get a lump in throat.positive,I didnt see anything so blood and cruel to laugh Well there are four stories in this film related by common characters But what are these stories and these characters They are unbeleivable and realistic in the same time The film is not like ordinary action or ordinary comedy there is something new that Tarantino brought to cinematograph If you dont afraid of blood brutality drugs homosexualists hitters frehcn words etc and if you are old enough to watch such films - watch Pulp Fiction Youll find how all of these can be fun Then watch this picture again - and maybe youll find something you missedpositive,i didnt expect so many plots can be told awesomely through visual story this movies really reflect what relationship and marriages point of view from men and women and i like how they chose the cast for this movies men would loved rosamund pike and women would loved to watch ben affleck i even checked here who the director really is and found out david fincher also directed another several awesome movies i had watched before fight club se7en the curious case of benjamin button zodiac the girl with the dragon tattoo i didnt realize that before but now i will be waiting another movies from himpositive,I did not see any movie ever like this one. This just showed an expect-able superhero to all of us. The joker really gave something especial acts to entertain us and he will be remembered forever. This movie actually taught us something that we can do anything as a society and in a society we need someone to guide us to move forward. why do we fall sir so that we can learn to pick ourselves up- Alfredcharacter from this movie . This is a sentence that i am using in my real life now when i got frustrated. I think this movie must be rated 10. The DirectorChristopher Nolan and the character BatmanChristian Bale was really successful to give what they expected and what viewers want. To sum up The director was able to show the activity about the social anti-corruption and THIS IS GREAT MOVIE OF ALL TIME.positive,I did not read the books before watching this well i read The Fellowship the Ring the first on before watching just this movie the third. Because i loved the first two to death. And i am writing this review for all three because i see them as one big movie divided by three. But i think The Return of the King is the best one so that is why i write the review here. I think The Lord of The Rings Trilogy is the best movie/movies in history. Great acting great environments great characters great story great world great....i could go on forever. Everything is just perfect. I could not say much more. Just watch it all three movies and you will be crushed by movie beauty crushed under the feet by this undefeated masterpiece. Best movie of all time. Thank Mr. Peter Jackson and JJR Tolkien for this.positive,i definitely wanted to see this movie as i am a huge fan of the disney version of sleeping beauty but i was still cautious being a fan helped me to enjoy and appreciate what they were trying to do with this movie after viewing maleficent i ended up loving the movie the acting the costumes and sets the story the emotion the humoreverything was superb i especially loved angelina jolie honestly no one could have done a better job if i had one criticism it would be that compared to the disney cartoon aurora in maleficent was not pretty enough elle fanning is ok looking maybe sort of pretty aurora in sleeping beauty? gorgeous by far the the prettiest disney princess of all in my honest and biased opinion all in all a great movie that only the trolliest of trolls would nitpick see itpositive,i couldnt wait to see gone girl ive loved most of david finchers movies with seven and zodiac being 2 movies i cant get enough of not to mention that word of mouth was saying it was another masterpiece and it is its awesome this moody thriller sees ben affleck as the centre of attention as his wife rosamund pike goes missing from here i dont really want to give anything else away as the movie really does go in as many different directions as you could possibly squeeze into a 2 and a half hour long flick i was thinking i had it sussed at first knowing that there were a couple of twists on the horizon but the fact that it can mislead you so easily is probably the reason why the film has become as popular as it has become there is virtually no way you will predict where this movie is going and when you think you have your wrong gone girl is a brilliantly twisted thriller that has a dark and complicated plot that will have you hooked on a film that manages to breath new life into the careers of many of its stars too ben affleck and neil patrick harris impress with their serious performances though the film has a sarcastic sense of humour at times too but the breakout star here is one time bond girl pike who is actually amazing as the gone girl of the titlepositive,I couldnt believe The Dark knight could live up to the hype. Thats perhaps the biggest surprise. The secret I believe is a stunning mature intelligent script. That makes it the best superhero movie ever made. As if that wasnt enough Heath Ledger. He the newest of the tragic modern icons present us with a preview of something well never see. A fearless extraordinary actor capable to fill up with humanity even the most grotesque of villains. His performance is a master class. Fortunately Christian Bales Batman is almost a supporting character. Bale is good but there is something around his mouth that stops him from being great. The Dark Knight is visually stunning powerful and moving. What else could anyone want.positive,I consider this movie as one of the most fantastic and joyful movie to watch. It touch a social problem that few movie directors and producers took the risk of doing like the institutionalized thing. All of the stories developed in this movie even if they are all related of the main character every own little story is very interesting and full of emotions. This movie contains good drama a different comedy insight. I think I have seen this movie at least 6 times and I just dont get tire of watch in it i think every time i watch it i found new things.I highly recommend to spend time enjoying this amazing movie and just a piece of advice is take the time to read a little bit the reviw and find no one bad.positive,I come from a region where commercial movies have been so dominant over the years that most people now judge films on how good the item songs were. Even in Hollywood the film industry has for long been dominated by cheap parlor tricks and flicks. To see a movie of such utter artistry class and creativity has thus been long awaited for me. This is a superhero fiction which seems real to say the least. Unlike most movies of its genre The Dark Knight does not end in a fistfight between the hero and the villain but turns into a battle between the dual nature of mankind. Every camera angle every single word of each character every beat of the background music every expression of each actor every twist in the storyline speaks on its own. The storyline is spectacular. Right from the first scene the movie focuses on the brutality of the joker the simple joy he feels by bringing about chaos and destruction. The joker will forever be the greatest villain of all time. He is a man of mysterious background questionable character and by his own accord an agent of chaos. The acting direction and screenplay of this movie is pure artistry. Christopher Nolan does not rely on high tech special effects but exhibits a high degree of intelligence on each of his films. Christian Bale has been very rightly referred to as the real Batman by many. And spare a thought for the great Heath Ledger who played out each scene while playing the highly complex role of the joker to absolute and absolute perfection. The Dark knight is by its own right the Everest of superhero filmspositive,I choose chaos says the Joker in one of the early scenes in the movie and those words sum up whats in store in The Dark Knight. Directed by the supremely talented Christopher Nolan The Dark Knight is a masterfully woven tale of anarchy and heroism that captivates you right from the opening scene. The events of The Dark Knight take place a few months from where Batman Begins left off. Gotham City continues to be a lawless frontier where organized crime flourishes but billionaire playboy Bruce Wayne Christian Bale is warming to the idea that the city may have found a hero in district attorney Harvey Dent played by Aaron Eckhart. Enter Heath Ledger as The Joker Dont let the name cuckold you. This Joker is no circus clown He has no background and his origins remain a mystery. He is to be put simply an anomaly in a world constantly striving to be normal. The Joker does what he does best: unleashing chaos on the streets of Gotham city. Batman on the other hand is trying his best to clean the scum off the streets of Gotham. It is this yin-yang relationship between the caped crusader and his lawless adversary that forms the crux of The Dark Knight. Nolan manages to extract superlative performances from all his cast members. Christian Bale is solid and stoic as our caped crusader. Aaron Eckhart delivers a sterling performance. Maggie Gyllenhaal Gary Oldman Morgan Freeman and Michael Caine provide ample support. But it is Heath Ledger playing the Joker with fire breathing abandon who indisputably steals the show. Whether its the opening scene where hes robbing a bank or when hes showing his little magic trick to the mob Ledger shows how you need to be tightly wound up and totally in control even when delivering a crazy out-of-control performance. As I had read somewhere Š—– he plays Forrest Gump gone mad but with ’©lan To call it the best superhero movie of all time would be the greatest disservice you could do to the genius of Christopher Nolan. The movie creates a place where good and evil Š—” expected to battle it on Š—” decide instead to get it on and dance. Brilliantly bleak and chillingly Gothic The Dark Knight soars on the wings of Nolans savage imaginationpositive,I cant stop thinking how Lotr:TTT and Lotr:Rotk would be if were not filmed together with the first film.Maybe Peter Jackson would thought that he should change some elements of the two last films in order to improve them resulting in many complains by the audience because The Two Towers and The Return Of The King lack the atmosphere of the first one.On the other hand maybe he could actually make them even betterHistory made me doubt this perspective.No one really knows .what we already know is that Jackson had some excellent material into his hands and made some wise decisions about how he would use them.Way to go Mr JacksonNow give us Silmarilion on screen too...positive,i cant say enough about this movie would give it 11 stars if possible after you get past the opening 10 minutes of sentimental dreck which really is not bad the rest of the movie never stops exceeding expectations when i was 9 i saw star wars in the theater with my father i knew nothing about it except that there were lines all summer at every movie theater where it was showing i remember being mesmerized and thinking it was the greatest movie of all time this is the first movie experience since then that i felt that way about see it in the theater you will be transported back to when you were a kid at the movies and everything was simpler when it was over i immediately wanted to go see it again this is no superhero movie it is much much more the action is there but this is more than an action moviepositive,I cant really think of one thing I didnt like about this movie Everything from the costumes the sets make up hair acting writing directing and editing All the best of the best Amazing work PulpFiction I must admit is a stellar piece of cinema A literally star-studded cast portrays the characters beautifully making you feel their joy and pain Plot wise there are numerous twists and turns as to be expected but they all manage to fit together rather nicely And while some things do remain unexplained or unaccounted for in the end it doesnt leave the viewer wanting Dialogue in this movie is particularly delightful with much reverence to dark humor and double-talk not unlike the film Lucky Number Slevin Ultimately the scenes I really like were with Uma Thurman I think Tarantino delivered a solid piece worthy of the place its earned in the upper echelons of most critics top 10positive,I cant figure out why I love this movie so much I have seen it more times than I can count and still it never gets old It is a very unique movie I particularly love the ending and think it is the best scene in cinema history some great acting by Samuel L Jackson The movie isnt meant to have a moral which is indicated from the pulp part of the title But in not trying to teach us a lesson the film hits even harder with one  I believe the movie is actually very deep with themes such as forgiveness and redemption One moment Butch is about to kill Marcellus the next he is saving him Jules is wrapped up in the life of crime and suddenly he sees a sign from god that he is a terrible person and he acts on this From Jules passage he has an epiphany that what he has being doing is wrong and realizes he needs to help someone else to start his journey towards redemption Everyone has something they want to change in their life something they want improved This was just the beginning of Jules transformation Though he isnt just stopping and forgetting all´Žè he has done wrong he feels he owes a favor to the world and that was just the beginning transformation If you have seen the movie you will understandpositive,I cant figure out how a man could think such an outrageous concept like thatIts just beneath all the beautiful thing.Thanks to Frank DrabountMorgan FreemanTime Robbins.Excellency is sky high in this film.Not a movieits just a lifetime experience.Sometimes people felt to sad they curse themselvesregret for everything they have done in life.They crush for successrun after money.Buthere is the thing that changes everything and it is indeed The Hope.No matter how bad you feelno matter how hard the path of the life isthe show is still goes on if you have just one thing and that is The Hope.Life would certainly changes if peoples take the deep meaning of this wonderfully executed movie.Probably It will help many people to start their life for the second timeHats off to everyone who worked with the Shawshank Redemption Team..positive,I cant believe that something so simply good exists. This is by far the best thing i have ever watched on my TV. I loved every piece of it and im gonna watch it once a year till my time on this world is over. I cant describe the feeling and joy you will have after watching it because i cant find the right words to describe it. Watch it and you will see what i mean. The first time is always the best. Its the time when it will leave you speechless for a couple of seconds. And after those seconds you will begin to understand that you just watched a masterpiece. What i liked the most is the big time span in which the movie plays. All those years in one place and the dependence for some people after you leave it.positive,I cant believe that around December this year we wont be having any LOTR movie. Im in denial and am convinced that Peter Jackson will make a new movie to tie up all the loose ends. They should have made this into an epic miniseries. Too many things left unsaid and undone in the Return of the King. Not that its not a good movie -- its the best Ive seen so far.. and as the finale of the LOTR trilogy it does go with a BANG rather than a whimper that Matrix Revolutions did. LOTR die hard fans want more.... thats why we are waiting for the extended version of the video. We need some closure...  one of my favorite shots in the film seems to be a homage to both the fast-paced unbreaking style of Scorseses Goodfellas and Roman Polanskis Rosemarys Baby. It is the scene where Travolta crashes his Malibu into Eric Stoltzs front yard and brings the ODed Thurman inside his house. As Rosanna Arquette hurls invectives at the two the camera wonderful work by Andrez Sekula moves back and forth between Arquette and Travolta and Stoltz lurching over Thurman thats the Scorsese part. Then as Stoltz goes looking for the plunger the camera follows him into a room where it inexplicably stops at the doorway so as to impede a full sight of Stoltz reminders of the scene where Polanski photographed Ruth Gordon in Rosemarys Baby by placing an obstruction between her and the camera so the audience would instinctively lurch their head to the side making a hopeless attempt to see around the obstruction. Such a phrase can be used to describe Pulp Fiction: most movies simply unfurl their stories at the audience. This movie subliminally makes you a part of the action. I recently had a semi-argument with a friend over the worth of this film over Natural Born Killers. Now dont get me wrong Oliver Stone is a powerful filmmaker but his film banged you over the head incessantly with points like Im Going to Use my Artistic License to Satirize the Over-the-Top Violence of Popular Culture by Making a Movie Replete With...Over-the-Top Violence In the style of David Spade Its called hypocrisy Oliver--check into it Anyways I digress. Anybody who bad-mouths this movie indeed has no appreciation for cinema  sure the film may have a goof or an errant philosophy somewhere  but Tarantino fulfilled any filmmakers dream in revitalizing cinema. You can say that the films tone didnt impress you that its style wasnt to your taste...but you cant deny the artistry that went into it. Morality For all of those who believe this film is an amoral travesty I suggest you rent the family favorite The Santa Clause and count how many times Disney shamelessly milks its own products or if God is mentioned even once in what is supposed to be a Christmas film. Or in ANY family film. What impressed me the most when I first saw Pulp Fiction was its inclusion of God at all many Generation-X filmmakers paging Kevin Smith are so agnostic in their beliefs that it was so refreshing to see one that painted divinity in such a positive light. You can have those other indie favorites Chasing Amy and Good Will Huntingboth starring those irritating crybabies Matt Damon and Ben Affleck and if you like those cynical films which are basically reworkings of oh-feel-sorry-for-me melodramas of the late-40s reworked with equally irritating alternative rock best summed up by the Smashing Pumpkins in a Simpsons episode: Alls we got is our millions of dollars our legions of fans and our youth. then you can have them. Compare that to Jules awakening I was just sitting here eating my muffin and drinking my coffee when I had what alcoholics refer to as a moment of clarity. and youll see how Tarantino turned the mythic Gen-X stereotype on its head as well. Pulp Fiction is in my opinion the king of the indies and one of the best examples of cinematic craftsmanship ever.positive,i believe that the film did more than enough justice to the science factfiction part of it with this movie christopher nolan tried to answer some questions that science is yet to the transition form fact to fiction was seamless even though some of the sequences in the movie are open to scientific debate they are simply beautiful  visually and emotionally as far as the story goes i could care less as the stunning visuals and great background  more than makes up for it for those who are not fully satisfied with the story i can understand could be because of a very high bar set by christopher nolan himself however dont let it hold you back if you like nolans movies if youre gonna watch it watch it in imax positive,I avoided seeing this film for years because I thought it was a grim prison uprising tale from Stephen King. Well I was one third right it is set in a prison but it is a very good story about friendship honesty forgiveness/redemption patience and loyalty. Im going to really try and not give away too much of the film because if you havent seen it yet you are missing out on a great story. Its set in a prison in the late 40s. Some of the inmates have been there since the early part of the 20th century and with repeated parole denials and no rehabilitation in sight many have been institutionalized and have lost hope and even lost sight of their own identity. When one such inmate is released he walks into a world that he barely recognizes. He tries but in the end fails to make it in the real world and succumbs to desperation and hopelessness. We see some of the guards greedily taking part in violence that is so vicious that it is difficult to discern the prisoners from the prison staff. But ultimately it is a tale of redemption and the story unfolds with hardship humor and grace. This is a film that I will see again and again.positive,I am usually never short on words... but I was stunned to silence... utter disbelief and sheer awe...this is a masterpiece... no two ways about it... and everyone can just forget about sending in their applications for the Oscars... this is signed sealed and delivered... not that it is any mark of greatness.. But as far as pop-culture goes Heath Ledger has left an undeniable mark on what acting can be and just why the villain can be the hero of the movie.... Heres my 2-bit review Christian Bale : Solid as ever... this guy cant put a wrong foot down... he as batman is everything batman should be brooding honest powerful conflicted heroic tragic... everyone of those emotions and more are portrayed with the greatest justice... Michael Cain and Morgan freeman: small roles but significant nonetheless. Michael Cain in particular left me impressed with he bandit in the forest story... and Morgan Freemans so much power in one mans hands was so apt and so relevant if-you-know-what-I-mean with bushs wiretapping etc... Maggie Gylenhall: well I didnt like her before the movie... but I must say I dont resent her anymore... Gary Oldman: one my favorite actors... one of my favorite all time characters Sirius Black from the harry potter series... as Gordon he is terrific. And the last part where he does the voice-over monologue youd have to be made of concrete to not feel a major chill down your spine... is there an award for voice-overs Then it should go to Gary Oldman... Aaron Eckhart... liked him from Erin brokovich loved him in Thank you for smoking... and as Harvey Dent he does justice... and as two-face he does even more so... And now Heath Ledger... any accolade I can come up will fall short... there simply is no comparison to anyone... Heath is in a world of his own... his psychopathic maniac turn as joker is so perfect that the 1989 jack Nicholson portrayal pales in comparison... dont get me wrong I love jack Nicholson to bits but Heath is jaw-dropingly brilliant for a lack of a better word... someone has to invent a new word to express what Heath has achieved... there is nothing that compares to this...every single scene he is in is a work of genius... his smirk the madness in his eyes...the immunity to pain... and the penchant for suffering is striking... even the scene where he claps at Gary Oldman... is so utterly disgustingly devilish that its pure cinematic magic... Christopher Nolan has entered the echelon of the great directors... this sweeping epic of a movie hits all the right notes and more... the background  is brilliant the special effects used to intensify the drama not just for the sheer heck of it... every single bit of the movies scripting is tied in so beautifully and so relevant that its astounding... My favorite moment when the joker tells why hes got the scar around his mouth and you think you have this maniac figured... you know the reason for his malice... but then he turns around and spins and entirely different story to another one of his victims... there go all your theories about the joker... you know that this guy is nothing but evil incarnate... There will be no greater loss for cinema goers than the knowledge that Heath will not be able to reprise his role... there would have been nothing better... just to see heath as the joker one more time... RIP Heath Ledger... this is your legacy...  Andy with his close friend in the prison  Red  tries redemption from this prison by the time  Andy tries to do beneficial things for people in the prison not to attract attention. It is unbelievable that they escape from this prison. But  Andy approaches to place of exit. It is actually amazing  it is really incredible. They go to their dreams to live a peaceful and quiet life. Also  Andy prepares a trap for the chief of the jail. After the redemption  they become free anymore. It is really an amazing movie. Easily one of the best movies made during the 90s and definitely one of the top prison movies of all-time. Pretty much everything about this movie works and works extremely wellpositive,I am sure this has been said before but Pulp Fiction is one of my favourite movies I have watched it numerous times and with each viewing more details appear it is almost impossible to suggest that one would be able to predict every twist and every turn that occurs in this film Tarantino breaks the typical chronological order in which a movie usually functions this is what makes Pulp Fiction so intelligent it is a particularly unusual feeling that occurs when the movie comes full circle and returns to the beginning as a means to conclude It is a tool he can use to provoke different reactions from viewers for example the death of a main character Vincent during the middle of the movie comes as a shock especially when he resurrects unscathed scenes later It is the lack of chronology that allows Tarantino to play with his characters whilst keeping their roles prominent This is never easy when applied to a movie in chronological order for example the death of Llewellyn moss in No Country for Old Men leaves the focus on Anton Chigurh though this is a Coen Brothers production and not a Tarantino one it still assists in illustrating the importance of Tarantinos chronological confusion As well as Tarantinos intelligent filming method he uses a cast that match their characters personality for example Samuel L Jackson usually plays the role of a tough yet eccentric and interesting type and Christopher Walken plays tends to play knowledge filled and enigmatic characters I am in no way saying these actors are generic I merely scrape the surface of what they are capable of Tarantinos characters as well as other roles played by these actors have detailed and interesting back-stories which add a significant amount of detail to the plot he leaves the viewer with such quotable phrases such as Jules Ezekiel 25:17 passage which I have found is a favourite when friends come to quote the movie As if the plot characters and dialogue is not enough to gain the viewers undivided attention it is padded with a number of details that are not directly linked to the plot yet still add interesting twists to the story This is why the movie has to be viewed at least twice to understand most of the aspects that occur It is Tarantinos intelligent use of the minor details that make this film what it is For example the significance of his characters in relation to his other films when given insight is mind-blowing Vincent Vega being a direct link to Reservoir Dogs Vic Vega And the consistent time on all of the clocks  Agreed I have only touched the surface of what this movie is about yet the detail on which this film is based cannot be put directly into words I can simply pick up on the intelligent use of dialogue characters the numerous twists and turns that occur and the small yet significant details that can be observed So I really do suggest you give it a watch :positive,I am so happy to see this film top 1 in IMDb. It deserves to be there. The Shawshank Redempion appears in 1994 I think this year was full of amazing pictures. It lost Oscars but gained recognition. This is a great story about friendship and redemption. Frank Darabonts best movie for sure. Andy Dufresne is one of the greatest characters ever made in the cinema art. A guy who is innocent and get punished. This film shows us that even our intention is a crime in a law world. No one is perfect and no one can predict anything. We live by a scheme and trying to be fair. People will always make mistakes and the greatest thing is to learn from them. I am waiting for movies which can touch me like this one but after year 2000 nothing close to that appears. There were great films about life and stuff but still its a modification a copy thereof what was before. I think until year 2000 most of valuable things in film art was told. Its a little sad but this kind of art will always be deep in my heart as a lesson and beauty how fantastic picture man create. I hope there will be at least couple movies in my short life that leave so many emotions like The Shawshank Redemption. In XXI century it is a very hard thing to do. I am patient and have positive thinking that cinema didnt say the last words.  and I respect that. However what I dont understand is why someone would say that Tarantino is a bad or not good enough director. Its simply not true and you know it This movie was done very well in more areas than one. Somehow the characters seem more natural in their behaviour the way they speak etc. The stories arent deep and the plot isnt very rich because it isnt supposed to be. This is just a look at some criminals caught in some interesting and messy situations. In order to really like this movie you need to set all your expectations aside and --very important-- watch it more than once. Youll probably like this movie even more the second time. But if you didnt like it a bit the first time you saw it -- dont waste your time Find something else to watch. This is the kind of film that you either love or hate. I love it. The cast is great the acting is amazing. The characters are very vivid and interesting. And even though some of the situations are a little outrageous Tarantino still made them believable. Butchs story was very entertaining and Jules is just the coolest - I like how he handles the coffee shop robbers at the end even though its not really the end... And the soundtrack -- fabulous. I think Tarantino has good pretty good taste in music. You wont find any s for his movies though - just really cool tunes from the sixties and seventies that were once popular but were forgotten. As for the violence... there isnt much of it really. Yes you heard me right. Next time you see PULP FICTION count the number of times you see a really violent scene and youll realize its not more than any other action/crime movie... And notice that they dont show that much -- its mostly your imagination filling in what the camera doesnt show you. I recommend this movie to all true motion picture fans. positive,i am more of a sciencefiction person that watches movies mostly for their effects and massive scenes i decided to check this one since i am a fan of the two main actors this was one of my best decisions regarding movie choice the movie starts normally with the story of the two main actors and how they are related the viewer is left with the impression that this will be another interesting story of a married couple and their struggles this goes until the plot twists so hard that you almost need to pause to comprehend what happened the plot is so well thought that you get the aha and so thats what happened moments every few minutes but it is apparent enough to let the viewer intelligent enough to guess some of the scenes just so they get astonished with the next one the movie leaves the viewer with the impression that there is a goodbad guy plot in the movie until the very end when the scenario twists again and leaves the viewer astonished and questioning if theres a bad character at all and what would they do in the characters placepositive,I am a nerd when it comes to Lord of the Rings probably not as big as others but being a nerd I have to say that this is my favorite movie of the amazing trilogy. I just love how well the movie was made and the action sequences always make my heart start pumping. The music is glorious to listen to and the movie as a whole is enchanting. Plus it has amazing actors doing amazing things. I would definitely recommend this movie to anyone who has not seem it...but only if you have seen the first two you have to see the first two in order for parts to make sense and click. It is one of those movies that you can practically can watch with anyone anytime.positive,I am a huge fan of Batman . Since I was little  he was a inspiration and today he still is . I had a dream that one day a hero like this  a story like this will have its place among the best movies of all times . When I first saw it  I had a major goosebumps all over my body and I was shocked by the greatness of achievement that Nolan did it with this movie . I literally love everything about this movie  I see no flaws and it still keeps me intense when I watch it . Heath Ledgers acting was a masterpiece  Heath have changed things forever  . Christian Bale is a best Bruce Wayne that can be in this movie industry and I am so sad that he will never do it again . These guys had a great support by their colleagues  Oldman  Gyllenhaal  Caine  Freeman and Eckhart  . And what would a movie be without a musical masterpiece of Hans Zimmer  He just blew my mind with this inspirational  dark and epic music . Ive always talked about this movie with my friends and they were always smiling because they taught it was just a silly Batman movie . But when theyve seen it  their comments changed and today they are still keep thanking me for my silly persuasion . Congratulations to Nolan for doing a very damn good job on making this movie .positive,I am a 38 Years old man from england who works for the second biggest oil company in the world......... I have : lovely family......great friends.....good job....... The film is perfect time and time again every time you watch it  Talking Points  Settings & locations  Actors  So much feeling  fantastic   and everybody involved in the production produced a masterpiece.......... Extra special thanks to Frank Darabont  i sincerely hope you are very happy and everything in your life is good .............. A total must have in the collection............. Thank you Trevpositive,I always define films as an artistic medium for a person to immerse himself to a place full of positivity and hope in an unending hymn. And for generation after generation theres only one film that I will always give praise for finally giving a masterpiece that successfully delivers that thought. A film called The Shawshank Redemption. Never has been before the film came out illustrates the triumph of human spirit behind any hardship in the most moving manner until this inspiring film. Its powerful in every way that for me it brought back the real definition of an excellent film which is a great story with great characters. Mainly about Andy Duferne Tim Robbins a skilled banker who was convicted for murdering his wife and her third party whos a pro golfer. Duferne sentenced for double life imprisonment was sent to the notorious and sullen looking Shawshank prison to serve his sentence. While counting his days inside several events happened to Andy. Meeting the sisters  was one of his hardships he needed to go thorough as they sexually assault selected prisoners like him which made his stay harder and longer than he thought. One day he also met Ellis Redding Morgan Freeman who was literally known to get things and run it through the walls of the prison as Andy asked him for a hammer. Unknown to Andy Redding had his bet on him earlier as the first one amongst the newest batch of inmates to break down. Subtlety the two became prison buds as the days became months and the months became years. The two almost stick together the whole time of their stay. They conversed things about the realities of prison. Which at times they contradicted at each others opinion for Andy had always been the hopeful dreamer and Redding with his face of realism. The story soon evolves into great circumstances in favor of Andy in spite of being a workhorse inside the prison exploited by several police and the warden himself for his skill of handling money Andy through his skill will and hope proved that there were great things waiting to happen for those who hoped and wait. For he always believed that HOPE is a great thing that everyone should always have. The Shawshank Redemtion is a film for the ages. Its beauty as a whole will never fade as it is one of those greatest films that show an almost tangible message to fathom. It is substance over style at the end of the day. And what it evokes is what matters which leaves you moved and some even satisfied for every tear that they shed from an abundance of happiness gave by a magnificent piece of literature. Its the best film Ive seen and it will always be carved to the bank of triumphant feeling. Truly excellent 10/10.positive,I adored this movie. If it doesnt get an Oscar for Best Picture something is very rotten in La La Land. It was uniformly superb. The battle scenes were stunning. I got dizzy watching them I applaud Peter Jackson and the rest of the Fellowship.positive,I admit it I love all three Lord of the Rings films. People may say Return of the King is the best of the trilogy some may say it is the worst. I personally think Two Towers is the best for its scope and better exploration of some of the characters but while it is still great Return of the King is better than Fellowship of the Ring. My only slight disappointment is the ending it does feel overlong and bloated for me almost as if there was more than one ending filmed. That said what does make the ending at least watchable for me is the way it is shot the marvellous  and the performance of Gollum. Despite this minor discrepancy Return of the King is extremely good and in my view one of the better Best Picture winners last decade. Peter Jacksons direction is very impressive here and the scope is massive and just dazzling to watch. All three films of the trilogy are very well made but Return of the King defines the term epic. The cinematography is mind-blowing the scenery is superb the costumes and make-up are well tailored the effects are superb and dont distract too much and the lighting is authentic. The  is phenomenal. Fellowship of the Ring had some ethereal rousing haunting and charming themes whereas Two Towers was somewhat darker and more complex. Return of the King merges these together and the result is a perfect mixture of charm darkness etherality and complexity. The story is compelling with themes of friendship strength and loyalty the screenplay is well-written and literate and while the film is very long the three hours or so fly by seamlessly. The characters are engaging Aragorn is even more interesting here than he is in the previous films while Gollum continues to steal every scene he appears in. The acting is very good. Orlando Bloomwho I can find dashing yet uncharismatic and bland and John Rhys-Davies are given less to do but do carry their parts very well and Elijah Wood is likable enough. Sean Astin captures Sam perfectly and provides the heart of the picture and Viggo Mortenssen is at his charismatic best here. Ian McKellen is perfectly cast while the design of Gollum is still superb and Andy Serkis is equally phenomenal. I was slightly disappointed by the lack of any Sarauman but I was more than I was satisfied with the final result. All in all an outstanding entry to a great trilogy. 10/10 Bethany Coxpositive,I actually enjoyed much of ROTK but I found it lacking in some major ways especially compared to the first two installments of the LOTR trilogy. 1 I found the whole scene in which Eowyn and Merry defeat the Lord of the Nazgul to be rather flat which is in stark contrast to the portrayal of this scene in the book - it just lacked the high drama found in the books depiction. 2 Omitting the Houses of the Healing left unanswered the question as to what happened to Eowyns passion for Aragorn - my wife who has never read the books wouldve been really confused had I not been there as a second source to explain how Eowyn fell in love with Faramir. 3 Leaving out the Scouring of the Shire made for a complete letdown at the end of the movie. This for me is the gravest mistake of the entire movie trilogy. The Scouring of the Shire in the book summarizes the whole moral of the story and shows that The Travelers i.e. Frodo Sam Merry and Pippin had learned to stand on their own two Hobbit-feet and werent just coat-tail riders. I hope its Jacksons intent to include 2 and 3 from above in the extended video when it gets released. Otherwise I will believe that in the very end of the story Jackson failed to deliver the whole goods as promised.positive,I absolutely loved this movie Not only is it the best of the series but it is also the one that most closely matches the books in terms of the feel of Tolkien and Middle earth. An Outstanding achievementpositive,I absolutely love this movie The first time I saw it I thought it was excellent but I didnt really get a good taste of it until watching it two more times Its the type of movie you just have to see more than once because of all the plot twists and turns Tarantinos dialogue is great and the acting is downright amazing SAMUEL JACKSON IS UNBELIEVABLE I really like this moviepositive,I absolutely love The Shawshank Redemption. When a movie gives me goosebumps it has done its job. Where to start. The acting in this movie is sublime. I had never seen any movie starring Tim Robbins but Morgan Freeman is one of my favorite actors. Tim Robbins portrays an intriguing man. He and Morgan Freeman work together extremely well. The story itself is brilliant. A banker wrongfully put in prison would not seem that interesting but with these people and their conversations and companionship its certainly worth a watch. I was sad when I thought the director killed off Andy Dufresne at the end but when I realised he had actually escaped I couldnt stop smiling until the movie was over. This movie certainly deserves the #1 spot in the top 250 movies as its a must see for everyone.positive,How wonderful when you went to the theater for this movies and 4 hours later you walked out with such a good feeling and simply forgot to realize that 4 hours had passed.This is such an amazing experience. The movie is such a great epic with good and evil great battle spectacle landscape characters with great spirit. From one of the greatest books which had many details the masterful adaptation of Jackson and Co bring them all to life without loosing the heart. The visual presentation is breathtaking sure you have never seen things like this before and it will be the greatest challenge for the next generation film makers to beat tough work for sure. All the art work is as good as the first two and HOWARD SHORE masterful music simply be everything the movie  should and suppose to be wow. Though overall the acting is not that excellence but it is really really good enough to be part of and a supporting for this instant-classic final installment. ........SEAN ASTIN........as SAM is the most memorable character from this cast he grab the audiences heart with the goodwill and loyal of his character especially the scene at the mount doom and OSCAR NOMINATION for him will not surprise me. And yes I love to see more of Blanchetts Galadriel the first class screen performer in such noble and powerful looks but even a very small role here she still be as great as she is always be why you are so unlucky with the Oscar...SO UNFAIR. Dear Peter Jackson thank you very much for guided visionary your highest ambitious and strong will to achieve it and of course you did it remarkably. Many may think like me what is your genius brain looks like..positive,How superb The Return of the King is. It is the ultimate fantasy film and a sure bet for all the film awards this year. Director Peter Jackson has achieved the impossible to make this trilogy and make it so that Tolkien fans will be pleased with it in comparison to the book. The special effects are amazingly good the actors Sean Astin who play Samwise Gamgee particularly are fabulous in their roles and the plot is unflawed representing the book perfectly. There are parts left out but this was always to be expected. Peter Jackson on first editing the film had a 6 hour long film that he was happy with. Now although us Lord of the Rings fans may have been more than happy to sit through that I dont think others would have been So inevitably pieces and lines from the book have been taken out. But what we are left with is a film that works perfectly and is a masterpiece. Undoubtedly there will be plenty of extra footage on the extended DVD and so well just have to wait for that to see the film in its entirety. Its arguably and in my own opinion the best of the three films and one that fans and just movie-goers will love. Its got action romance and an ending that leaves us satisfied and wanting to see it again and again. Go and see it nowpositive,how on earth is this film attracting so much criticism? this is one of the best films of 2014 and people are labelling it utter tripe an enormous heap of illogic and nonsense wish i had missed it are these people serious? can we no longer appreciate  or even identify  a great film? gone girl is a peerless plotdriven story about a wife who goes missing seems pretty ordinary right? well its not and it doesnt take very long at all for any sane viewer to recognise this you start watching and  as you do with any mystery  you start collecting the clues and piecing together an explanation for the events which have taken place but no sooner than you have formed the perfect explanation in your mind is it immediately swept away in the most overwhelming twist of the year and it only gets better from there gone girl is a rollercoaster only youre riding it in the dark you dont know where the next turn is you cant see where youre headed and you have no idea how many more ups and downs youre going to experience before its all over its a film that keeps you guessing and just as youre beginning to once again think youve got it all figured out the game changes and its all up in the air once more the diaryexposition format is also very clever and was executed perfectly many films fall victim to losing the viewer when jumping back and forth between past and present yet gone girl  you guessed it  does it just right this film ranks high in the mysterythriller genre it is just as compelling and perplexing as shutter island  if not then moreso and lets not forget the acting ben affleck and rosamund pike do a phenomenal job in their roles as husband and wife not a line feels out of place and both seem as though they were born to play nick and amy dunne by the end of the film i felt so immersed in their story that i found it hard to believe it was just a film all in all i for one am thoroughly pleased with gone girl i knew from watching the trailer it would be something i would like i just never imagined it could thrill me this much a very underrated and overwhelming story that should be enjoyed by allpositive,Hope is a good thing and this movie can teach you about hope and no fear about to be prisoner of you own freedom.

Christian bale as expected delivered another great performance as batman. only this time we saw a whole new side to the cocky confident billionaire Bruce Wayne. Gotham city is going through its toughest time ever and you see that in bales discerning batman. i can see im writing on and on here. so ill just say this about the crew and supporting cast- Christopher Nolan - visionary director made Gotham city darker deeper bigger yet more beautiful than ever. Aaron Eckhart - truly portrayed what you would expect of the most realistic version of two-face. Michael Caine - after his performance in batman begins youd only expect the best from Caine as Alfred and thats what we got in dark knight. Maggie Gyllenhaal - great acting ability tops Katie Holmes portrayal of Rachel Dawes for sure. Gary Oldman - what do you think Morgan Freeman - Lucius fox in his most powerful moments. 10/10 - best superhero movie.... ever.positive,honestly i have nothing bad to say about the movie the cast was amazing the plot was awesome even the little jokes and back stories were epic the effects were as in any marvel movie great the fact that they used old classic rock songs as the soundtrack makes me love it even more chris pratt is perfect for the role of star lord even though i would have liked seeing jenses ackles really love karen in the movie as well and lee they were all perfect for their roles would have liked seeing more of thanos though all in all it was money well spent seeing the movie just sad that the ship didnt sailpositive,Hi I heard details about this movie first time two years ago from a friend. Before that in some movie channels I used to see the title been shown but never saw it. A jail movie....slow..not for me.I was in college those days in the nineties. In 2007 when my friend told me that whenever he feel sad or down he thinks of this movie and moves on. I replied back for me its rocky he asked if I have seen it and when I told him that I did not the only answer he had was it..watch it and then compare it. Now in 2009 with the recession going on lots of trouble in work and tensions of home and personal life for me. While changing channels I chanced upon this movie which had started and I had lost some ten minutes. I did not change the channels later and saw it in complete. The only reaction was tears in my eyes in the end and called my family and close friends. It was a shaking experience and I got my answer....I needed to get out of my jail. I sent mails to my friends about the movie and review few had seen it already and many did not. Result more people watched it...and guess what I for the first time rated in this website for the movie. ..AND i expect some of my friends also did it. This is the reason why after 15 years this movie is still alive because of its human spirit story....with more followers than fans. I hope that answers some of your doubts...... This movie is for those who are busy dying......and now know its important to get busy living.positive,Hi guys.........I saw this movie more than 10 times. After watching this movie I became a fan of Batman and mainly Christopher Nolan. The way he projected the JOKER character was Awesome. Main highlight of this movie was Joker. All credit goes to Heath Ledger Who played Joker Character and Nolan. Heath Ledger performance was master class. Dialogues were simple and superb. I didnt know why Nolan changed the actress who was playing RACHEL character In Batman Begins it was Katie Holmes but it didnt matter. Script and Screenplay were intelligent and stunning. Climax scene was awesome and moving. I think its the best super hero movie I have ever seen. So its a must watch film.positive,hey all all you guys are saying that movie shouldnt have huge rating because its not so good as it got ratedso for those people who think that they are looser they just cant see reality and dont wanna face it the beauty of movie iswho plays the boy of the title was 7 years old when the movie started filming and 18 when it finished as well as all crew included so its mean it had been 12 years to make a movie and the director have to wait for it but unfortunately he diedbut movie still accomplished by othersthis best shot i can give you this movie is awesome very natural and heart touching movie for people who have wisdom on upper portionpositive,heres my profile never saw sleeping beauty a medium sized fan of disney a cynic and i hate buying into over hyped disney blockbustersbut maleficent moved me deeply i honestly expected a movie like the snow white adaptation with charlize theron and instead it was twice as entertaining and quadrupled in meaning its twist on what true love really is just melted me i havent loved a movie this much in a long time it also renewed my subscription as an angelina fan i havent been interested in many of her flicks since changeling she truly is an exceptional woman a face performance and wardrobe so menacing yet her eyes still managed to convince you otherwise the innocence of elle fanning as an actress had me choked up half the time this is not a run of the mill disney good guy vs bad guy movie they really transformed the story into something unforgettable stand alone excellent filmpositive,Heath Ledgers role as the Joker is nothing less than pure genius From his modernized look that truly captured the essence of this comic book villain to his perfectly creepy voice to his facial expressions and body movements. This is is one of my all time favorite films and I never tire of viewing it. While Christian Bale did a fine job as Batman the film wouldnt be what it is if not for Ledgers role as the Joker. While there is a morbid element that surrounds the film due to Ledgers death like Lees untimely passing in The Crow I believe the popularity of this film is most definitely due to the amazing acting Ledger directing Nolan music Zimmer along with the hundreds of talented behind the scenes people and not because of Ledgers unfortunate passing. If you havent seen this film I would be shocked but if you really havent just buy it because it should be in every movie fans collectionpositive,Heath Ledgers edgy portrayal of the Joker is a frightening and macabre vision of the Clown Prince of Crime. Sure his costume is the right colours but shades of purple and green have never looked so muted like hes been dragged through the filth of alleys and gutters. His makeup is a halloween gone wrong: applied blood red over torture scars smudged & cracked white wash blacken sharks eyes of death capped by a entangled toxic green weave of hair. While his lip smacks and tongue snakes his many quotable psycho babble tirades on chaos and madness had this preview screening audience in silent shock and awe. As fans we wait to finally hear the Jokers maniacal laughter...we are rewarded. But it is a chilling laugh that plays on our nerves with a subliminal shrilling echo that will haunt us long after the film. His facial twitches and deliberate gestures work to induce a hypnotic and mesmerizing hold on Gotham/audience. His weapon of choice not the lint or veg peeler is the knife for both its ability to inflict a visceral cold kill and likely because it was an instrument of his own twisted grinning origin. The lack of origin story is also effective as an open book for the imagination. The hand held cam scenes of Joker 1st POV filming his prey and the off cam torture is a stark reminder of the realty of terrorist footage. From the sick punch line of his disappearing pen trick to becoming a masochistic punching bag for The Batman Joker can certainly dish out as well as he gets. The Joker casts pure fear into the minds of Gotham by testing the citizens beliefs and moral lines of good and evil. This Mad Dog of Chaos thrives in a world without rules where even the Good of Gotham can succumb to corruption and conflict. Hence his handiwork in the transformation of Gothams White Knight to Harvey Two Face Dent. The eerie background music is like a deaf tone barbed-wire noise that rings through Gothams cityscapes as a harbinger of the Jokers evil to come. In all fairness Ledger cannot be compared to Nicholson. Its Apples and Oranges. Burtons 80s film delivered a comic book to screen thug turned clown which was hammed up with the flair and suave thats stamped with Jacks vintage trademark. Ledger has redefined the role and delivered a nightmare Monster that wont let you awake or escape. All truly memorable screen villains are able to forever get into the mind of the protagonist and audience. It is with this performance that Ledger/Joker joins the ranks of the top three cerebral cinematic killers namely Hopkins/Lecter Spacey/Doe. This is a tour de force Oscar worthy performance that lives up to the hype rare thing and even raises the bar even rarer. So kudos to Ledger/Nolan and TDK Team for unleashing the perfect villain for The Batman. And remember the next time youre playing a card game your hand may come up with the Jokers signature calling card. RIP HL.  Shawshank redemption does one hell of a job. From the very get go Shawshank will have you on the edge of your seats. Tim Robbins a man whose career was on an initial down hill slide with flops such as Howard The Duck redeemed himself and then some with his portrayal of a man who looses everything in a second and then spends 20 years trying to get it all back. Robbins gave a calm misdemeanor to his character which always gave the impression that he had something planned that we were not expecting. Morgan Freeman gives in my opinion the best performance of his distinguishable career. He maintains a streetwise wisdom and this too me makes him the go to guy of the prison. His calm yet intelligent nature is kept through out the film and does not seem affected by Andy but after the escape Freeman does superbly in showing the contrast in the streetwise dealer of the prison to a man who misses his friend. Thomas Newmans compelling  sets a dark and ominous tone and does what many s dont  it reflects the thought of the characters as opposed to the tone of the scene. Darabont created a diverse prison world from the street smart ones to the homesick ones to the rapists but I was not a fan of how racism was sidestepped in the movie. If I had one nit pick and this is scraping the bottom of the barrel  I would have expected a few racial slurs directed at some of the prisoners particularly Red. It would have been true of the time but then again its not the point of the story. Ultimately Shawshank Redemption is a masterpiece and has a powerful yet happy enough ending to touch the heart of anybody.  positive,he did it nolan did it again all i can say to you whoever you might be is that cinema will never be the same anymore after interstellar nolan and his team bent all the rules and reinvented the art its not a movie its an experience and it will change you forever interstellar is not only a touching remarkable and unforgettable movie it is cinema itself and all the things it was meant to be as an artform a chance was given to matthew mcconaughey and all i can say is that he clinged to it with all his talent and passion and the result is this fantastic piece of art this unique performance by all means if you love cinema and an amazing story of humanity and sacrifice buy the ticket and watch the movie and if you do please let it be in imaxpositive,Having never watched a Tarantino film before I was recommended Pulp Fiction as an extremely striking and memorable film and among the most quoted films of all time. Despite the initially confusing start with new characters and situations being introduced very quickly with no apparent connection with one another I was completely sucked in to the darkly comic and often disturbing world. The All-star cast were all brilliant especially John Travolta and Samuel L Jackson who bounced off one another to make genuinely believable partners in crime. The final scene is both fantastically acted and is one of the most lasting images of the film. Overall it is a gripping and hugely enjoyable film save for Tarantinos appearance.positive,Having carried the burden of guiltily concealing a debt to Peter Jacksons widely known and acclaimed trilogy only now do I realise I can truly call myself a film fan. Calling it outstanding brilliant perfect would simply being echoing past recognition which you already know of. Up until the point of watching I was convinced the likes of other trilogies such as the repetition dodging Toy Story and Star Wars would always out do what I used see as a medieval fantasy filled with mythical creatures. Yet theres something incredibly humane about LOTR as a whole the pointy ears and hairy feet may dismiss such an idea but when the soundtrack swells as does your heart you get to quote the narrator of Fight Club: Lost in oblivion. Before watching I didnt know my elf from my hobbit now I know my Gollum from my Gandalf my Gondor from my Mordor. Back in The Two Towers our hairy footed friends had grudgingly united with Gollum who continues to offer his schizophrenic assistance of taking Sam and Frodo to an unknown entrance that will let them pass into Mordor unnoticedpositive,Havent read the books yet but considering how good this movie wasI plan to get them. In this final chapter Frodo BagginsElijah Wood and Samwise GamgeeSean Astin continue their quest to Mt. Mt. Doom in Mordor to Toss the one ring into the fire to destroy the dark lord Sauron. Meanwhile AragornViggo Mortenson LegolasOrlando BloomGimliJohn Rhys-Davies and GandalfIan McKellen Prepare for war against Saurons horde of Uruk-Hai in order to buy Frodo time to make it the Mt. Doom. This film had Action Suspense Heart and a great story. The acting was certainly Oscar worthy. Speaking of the Oscars this film deserved all eleven it was nominated for but I dont need to say that because it did win all of them. The only thing I didnt like was the extended ending which kind of dragged a bit. One of the best films of the decade in my opinion.positive,have you seen maleficent? its really good i honestly thought angelina jolie was done but she was amazing have you seen maleficent? its really good i honestly thought angelina jolie was done but she was amazinghave you seen maleficent? its really good i honestly thought angelina jolie was done but she was amazinghave you seen maleficent? its really good i honestly thought angelina jolie was done but she was amazinghave you seen maleficent? its really good i honestly thought angelina jolie was done but she was amazinghave you seen maleficent? its really good i honestly thought angelina jolie was done but she was amazinghave you seen maleficent? its really good i honestly thought angelina jolie was done but she was amazinghave you seen maleficent? its really good i honestly thought angelina jolie was done but she was amazinghave you seen maleficent? its really good i honestly thought angelina jolie was done but she was amazinghave you seen maleficent? its really good i honestly thought angelina jolie was done but she was amazingpositive,Have you read my IMDb review of Quentin Tarantinos Reservoir Dogs The one where I say that although the film is far from what I would class as original the director unashamedly plundering the annals of obscure/cult/foreign cinema the manner in which it is presented makes it a marvellous work of art in its own right Same thing applies here Only more-so Pulp Fiction is an exquisite patchwork-quilt of a movie stitched together from ideas elements and scenes gathered together by Tarantino during his formative years as a movie-obsessed video store clerk Assembled with an unerring eye for detail and the vision of a true artist the film is a marvel to beholdŠ—”over two and a half hours of pure cinematic brilliance which proves just as captivating for me now as when I first clapped eyes on it almost two decades ago Bold and bloody with stunning performances from a wonderful ensemble cast a flawless soundtrack witty and highly quotable dialogue and even a character called Brett this impeccable slice of gritty neo-noir is fully deserving of top marks 10/10positive,Have never been a comic book adaptation with so many details and so a devotion seen. Even watching it often I see things I have not seen before. The structure of the story is the madness. Always exciting and MIT an initial sequence of you the stool skin. Nolan has managed a gloomy character created and still a sinister and yet an enemy who seems to be the winner in all situations. Although it is the viewer not immediately noticeable. Im looking forward to the third part and hope that Nolan nevertheless by the tragic death of Ledger creates a dignified end of this fantastic and epic Triloigy to find. So until then.positive,have courage and be kind because kindness is powerful and magical this is the kind of corny sentiment that can turn me off luckily cinderellas syrupy sweetness is so hopelessly romantic that its sincerity swept me off me feet often reducing me to tears its the kind of oldfashioned filmmaking we need one that hearkens to the days when movies helped us forget our troubles instead of pointing them out with complete earnestness and a refreshing lack selfcommentary branagh brandishes the ubiquitous romance with more grace and fun than a fairygodmother could shake her wand at cinderella is a fleshed out version of the story you already know more focused on being charming than surprising you may ask do we need another cinderella movie? but this modern takes inherent loveliness reminds us why the term a cinderella story has become the ubiquitous term for any ragsto riches tale lily james in a stunningly beautiful turn as the titular servantturnedprincess possesses the grace vulnerability poise and animated quirk needed giving purpose to her characters unrestrained goodness the design is immaculate like a reallife disney story with british costume drama sensibilities even the  and narration which are relatively generic fit the emotional and regal tones of this honestly sad yet ultimately triumphant childrens fable okay so its not breaking new ground its simply an unabashed fairy tale with its soul deep in humanity however in a culture working so hard to comment on itself at every turn maybe cinderellas comfortable confidence in its own simplicity is the very thing making it groundbreaking emotionally powerful and sweetly entertaining cinderella is refreshingly pure disneymagicpositive,guardians of the galaxy is one of the least known comic books of marvel the only reason why the whole world aside of the fans of the source material are going to see this because its a marvel production but we should all admit that apart from the comic geek world nobody knew who rocket racoon and groot were before the film was announced nobody heard of starlord before chris pratt was attached to the project and most people hardly knew what it is actually about while many are still seeking for a doctor strange or an antman movie we should first get to know something that havent got enough attention before and wondrously these filmmakers introduce this mythology with huge love not only to its own but also to the fantasyadventure genre and its old classic form which easily delivers the sheer fun but even in the realm of explosions and zany worlds the best parts of the journey ended up being the scenes with the characters interacting and often to engage a set of great humor and drama that is already too much to ask for a ridiculously fun blockbuster it is certainly a space adventure it already offers a lot of strange alien designs and intergalactic action but the big stuff arent the only highlight of the movie the film would mostly focus on its characters nearly all of them may be aliens but their pathos and personalities are downtoearth how the team was formed is the same way how the avengers did they arent nice to each other but they had to get along so they may save the world or galaxy but here their motivations are either for revenge or money instead of heroic pride how they introduced themselves may be a little too over explained through their conversations the exposition is so relied on the dialogue but what keeps it from being exhausting is when those talks lead to a naturally clever punchline the film is just best when the heroes are developing their sudden friendship turning themselves from cold hearted thugs into a likable band of misfits the film also has a big love for the seventies music and it smartly uses it for peter quills last earthly thing hell ever possess in his otherworldly life these parts with the characters make the action the secondary appeal of the film but that doesnt always mean its a bad thing this is basically going back to the past blockbusters when rooting for the characters was more important than trying to advance the technicalstyle abilities but then it doesnt have any problem with the action except sometimes the space battles can be hard to follow but again whenever theres a humor in it the consistency goes back on track its simple fun sometimes nostalgic piece of adventure that doesnt have to be overserious to be outright compelling but it also does have some drama while it doesnt entirely embraces its sadness it at least gives some hints behind the characters and manifests the heart and brutality of their backstories eventually the actors are excellent indeed as they give plenty of shining and charismatic personalities to their awesome characters the plot may not be too sharp or its villains may not be so memorable but guardians of the galaxy still reaches its goal of lovingly introduces its universe to the ones whove never heard of it since everyone is aware that superhero movies are made for the mass more than its fans lets have to be honest about this this idea may not always be taken seriously especially when comic book movies have gone to its dark and gritty era and yet this one offers us stuff like a talking tree and a gunslinging raccoon but here it is guardians of the galaxy the movie that isnt meant to exist ending up being one of the greatest films that marvel ever produced since iron man is it a bold choice for them? probably but its really not hard having selfawareness the triumph of the film is reliving the classic somewhat campy space opera and marking its characters as its real deal even when they are not as familiar as many of marvels heroes in the end its just pure fun the flaws are there but at some point it doesnt matter every moment of the film has the excitement and laugh that anyone would seek for a blockbuster taking place in a fascinating new world that we are yet to fully explorepositive,guardians of the galaxy is nothing short of an amazing movie if theres anything i can say its that it is the best superhero movie i have seen not only does it have the impressive set

i didnt even know what this movie was about or what to expect since im not a marvel geek however i always loved movies taking place in the galaxy and stuff like that so i went to see gotg one word  phenomenal absolutely amazing its been such a long time since i had so much fun watching a movie the first scenes were pretty sad and moving but after that  it was a super fun ride this movie is packed with action and comedy ive got to say there was not a single moment that i would get bored 1010 is my rating because thats how much i loved it  definitely the best movie for the summer of 2014 i absolutely recommend it to everyone positive,Greatest Super Hero movie of all time. One of the Top crime dramas of all time. Greatest Heath Ledger performance. Heath WILL win the Oscar just like the Golden Globe. Nolan has MADE Batman. If you didnt get a chance to see this in Imax when it was out now is the time with the re-release. This movie is amazing in Imax. The opening scene is entirely in Imax and any time you see a city shot as well. Also the great chase scenes are done in the Imax. This must be up there with most reviewed films of all time but Hey..... Its that good. Seriously if you havent seen this by now SHAME ON YOU  he swore the script was the best she had ever read and that shed be perfect for the non-existent part of Hayworth. 6. It Was Filmed in Ohio Although the film is set in Maine the Ohio State Reformatory in Mansfield Ohio stood in for Shawshank Prison. The structure was slated to be torn down but the production delayed the demolition for a year. After the film wrapped all the buildings in the complex were torn down except the cell block and main administrative building which were preserved for historical purposes. 7. Morgan Freeman Got Really Good at Catch The scene where Andy first approaches Red about the rock hammer as Red plays catch in the main yard took nine hours to shoot. Freeman continued to play catch for the whole nine hours without complaining and showed up the next day with his arm in a sling. 8. The Film Was Inspired by Goodfellas Darabont says his main source of inspiration was Martin Scorseses Goodfellas because of its use of voice-over narration and editing techniques. 9. Voiceovers Are Tricky Business Originally all of Morgan Freemans voice-over was recorded before any of the film was shot. The fact that much of it syncs up to the on screen action see: the scene on the roof where the inmates drink beer isnt simple editing. Darabont would playback the recorded voice-over on-set during each take for the actors to specifically play off of the audio. But the audio quality of his voice-over was too poor to include in the movie due to tape hiss so Freeman had to re-record the entire voice-over in post-production. 10. They Got Lucky with One of the Most Famous Scenes Every take of the films signature shot of Tim Robbins raising his arms outstretched in the rain after Andy breaks out of prison was out of focus except the one in the film. It was the final take shot for that scene. 11. The Prop Guy Was a Jokester The visual joke of Andys rock hammer being tucked into the Bible right after the first page of the Book of Exodus came from the films prop master Tom Shaw. 12. None of the Close-up Shots of Andys Hands or Feet are Tim Robbins Theyre director Frank Darabont. 13. Stephen Kings Red Was Changed for the Film In the original novella Red is described as a middle-aged Irishman. 14. The Mug Shot of Young Red Isnt Morgan Freeman Its actually a photo of his son. 15. The Tree Where Red Finds Andys letter Isnt in Fort Hancock Texas Its in Ohios Malabar Farm State Park. positive,Greatest fantasy movie of all time. I have watched it at least 63 times and cant get enough best movie Of all time 10 out of 10. The movie is a masterpiece made by a master of film. The only bad thing about this film is that it does not go for long enough..... 3 hours is to short for a movie. My favorite character was Aragon because he is the definition of badass. Legolas was also badass but gimli was lacking in badassness but that is was defined the characters. Peter Jacksons sneaky cameo appearances in these movies were also another highlight of the best trilogy of all time. Overall I rate this movie a 10 out of 10. If you have not watched this movie then I spit in your general direction I like turtles. #HALAMADRIDpositive,Great music superb actors. It is a pity that Forrest Gump which I consider another masterpiece  went out the same year and got all the publicity as well as the Oscars. It was not fair. The only reason for which I rented this movie two years ago was because of Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins. But it was a big surprise to see one of the best films ever made.  I have seen it 6 more times since then  It is a story of COURAGE PERSEVERANCE TRUE FRIENDSHIP HOPE AND REDEMPTION. ITS A MOVIE FOR ALL TIMES A MEMORABLE ONE. EVERYBODY SHOULD SEE IT. YO’_ WONT REGRET.positive,Great movie. A mustsee for everyone. The script the acting the directing... Its all topnotch. I can give a detailed review but it wont help you. You gotta enjoy this one yourself without any details told.positive,Great Movie The most amazing Batman film ever. After seeing this movie I was left speechless. The performances from every actor and actress was amazing. Just an excellent film.............. a must movie to see It has ACTION. It has LAUGHS. It has HUMOR. It has non stop ONE LINERS from the joker.If any movie has deserved a perfect 10 this would be it. Excellent work Thanks for that. The most amazing Batman film ever. After seeing this movie I was left speechless. The performances from every actor and actress was amazing.positive,Great movie It really expands from Batman Begins. I know that there has been a huge controversial topic when the movie first came out but Christian Bales voice as Batman was amazing. It really differentiates these films from the other Batman films. Its something people would do to hide their identity. Anyone would recognize you from your voice if they know you. Heath Ledgers performance is absolutely amazing and it saddens me dearly that hes gone. Especially at such a young age. The Dark Knight trilogy has become my all time favourite in the live action films of the comic book world and I hope that other movies that DC produces will follow. Ultimately Christopher Nolan has done an amazing job and with an amazing cast it became a huge impact on the way people see Batman. Great movie Deserves huge amounts of creditpositive,Great Move. Although the movie was slightly different than the book itself. The special effects and the intensity of the characters were remarkable. I would recommend this movie to all my friends. The movie got better and better since the 1st part. I have watched part 2 about 10x and will do the same with the 3rd. I hope they come up with the trilogy to buy it all at the same time.positive,Great film exposing Quentin Tarantinos expert directing talents and an all-star cast of brilliance The use of chronological order is perfect able to be understood by a wide range of viewers My favourite scene being when Butchin car sees Marsellus on the crossing and if youve seen the film the rest til the bit after the shop minus the violation youll understandpositive,granted i heard terrible things about this film before i saw it on video after watching this film several times i got the plot but i also get a little more each time i love watching dame vanessa redgrave as a female criminal mastermind in this role i also enjoyed a bit known actor rolf saxon an american expatriate living in london as william donloe remember hes the poor sucker that gets the blame for a breaking an entry that caught him off guard i like rolf saxon as the gullible american in this film hes the best part of the film in my opinion and the surprise to me since i became a fan of his in 1994 after watching old capital city episodes i believe did his job extremely well and deserved to be listed in both beginning and ending credits of the film i love john voight and cant imagine why angelina jolie doesnt want much to do with him i felt tom cruise was adequate i like vingt rhames and henry czerny in the their roles i forget the french actress who was voights wife thats too crazy to believe i thought that kristin scottthomas and emilio estevez deserved more time on screen but thats the movie for you i loved the prague setting virginia countryside and london as wellpositive,gone girl two words epic win david fincher just won film making hands down awesome story film acting soundtrack everything need a horror? here need a suspenseful plot that blows your mind? here need a love story that you simply adore? yep here and no this isnt a date night film or is it? the psychological seduction here was wonderful you get to see the situation from several perspectives as the film progresses and you cant stop second guessing what will happen next on occasion even whats actually happening now my wife and i cant stop talking about this film were trying to watch the daily show after returning from the theater and everything literally everything is just tuned out after that film so much to talk about so many spoilers but i wont i cant ill simply say this film was fantastic just ride it out if it doesnt grab you in the first thirty minutes by an hour in youll be helpless to do anything but continue and its sooooo tasty its such a delightful plate of betrayal seduction revenge conspiracy and humanity at its best and worst unlike every other film that came out in 2014 this one will stay with me for far too many reasons the biggest being this could actually happen which makes it far more frightening and closer to home it also makes you think about how easily truth can be distorted and more to the point wonder what the average person is willing to do to get what they want from life smiles 10 out of 10 amazing film a perfectly crafted movie for people who love good moviespositive,gone girl review 1010 oh my god janice from friends this movie was amazing gone girl is directed by david fincher and stars ben affleck rosamund pike neil patrick harris and tyler perry? ben affleck stars as nick dunne a man whose wife goes missing on the anniversary of their wedding and i wont say anything more because the best way to watch it is to not know anything i will say right now thisisawesome first david fincher fincher is one of if not the best director working todayall time i can not put to words how much i love finchers movies i mean se7en zodiac fight club the social network look at that list of movies come on but enough about fincher how about rosamund pike and we will get to ben affleck but to me she was the best part of the movie even beating out affleck she will and should win best actress for the oscars this year she is just great in this role and from what i have read of the book 20 pages she fits the character very well now ben affleck i unlike some people have always loved ben affleck especially now in his career with some of his recent films directing with gone baby gone the town and argo and acting with those same movies and now this i think peoples opinions of will change next our supporting actors neil patrick harris and tyler perry first neil patrick harris i personally am a big fan of his and himym but i dont think he really fits into the movie his character couldve been played better by someone else doesnt take away from my enjoyment of the film now tyler perry what the fpositive,gone girl marks finchers tenth feature film and his most mature work since fight club centering on nick dunne a husband desperately trying to find his wife all while having police and media accuse him of murder the story sounds straight out of the scott peterson case and the film looks unlike any film ive seen in recent years lead by an all star cast featuring ben affleck rosamund pike tyler perry and neil patrick harris gone girl rises above the pack with smart storytelling phenomenal pacing and perfect performances what gone girl does so brilliantly is taps into the audiences psyche regarding marriage and the ideology behind a sanctioned union that is corrupt it is really heavy stuff when the story really gets to the meat and bones of it all with plenty of twists and turns gone girl keeps you not only second guessing the whole idea of marriage but the intentions of every character in the film it is truly one of the most twisted films adapted from an even sicker and twisted book thats out there right now gillian flynn does wonders with her adaption from her own novel the dialog is crisp the characters are multilayered it truly is a pitch perfect script that doesnt have one false moment in it ben affleck and rosamund pike are excellent in this film this is a different affleck a very human and realized affleck nick dunne is a wonderful role for him and captivates just how good he can be with a terrific director harris and perry give well rounded performances as well but are nothing compared to affleck and pike david fincher and his long time collaborator and cinematographer jeff cronenweth create a dreary horrific tone for gone girl that makes every twist and turn that much more gut wrenching every shot is meticulously planned showing each shot as if it were a still frame that spoke a thousand words it is truly gorgeous filmmaking and now for the trent reznor and atticus finch deliver a perfect  besting their social network and girl with the dragon tattoo  if reznor won for social network i fully expect not only a nomination but a win for this film overall this is a mesmerizing film that demands multiple viewings to truly get the full experience it is impeccably made beautifully acted and an all around near perfect filmpositive,gone girl is the most exciting thriller ive seen in a long time ill be shocked if it doesnt end up my 2014 top 10 list before you go see this one you better apply ample amounts of deodorant because it is the kind of movie that will shake you and make you sweat a lot it begins on a strange evening nick ben affleck and his wife amy rosamund pike are celebrating their 5th wedding anniversary but when nick gets home his wife is not there the front door is open and there are signs of a struggle inside in the ensuing media frenzy the public fall in love with amy and everyone frantically searches for her with all eyes turned towards him nick begins acting suspiciously or at least not the way that the media thinks he should be acting the media turns on him in an ever increasingly torturous descent filled with devastating revelations gone girl is filled with so many twists and turns that im not going to be able to tell you much about the plot but i can tell you what my viewing experience was like imagine that you are walking down a dark alley in a seedy part of town you see someone hurriedly running through out of their pocket a ticket falls out you pick it up and on it reads the most dazzling show on earth unforgettable it will shake you to your core you notice the price on the ticket reads $100 and that the show is nearby you yell out to the stranger but they are already long gone so go take a look inside is a massive amphitheater but only a few people are attending none are in the front row and everyone seems to be keeping to themselves you sit down and notice that the stage is set up like a magic show a nervouslooking man enters fitted with a straight jacket and led by a beautiful femmefatalelooking assistant he is thrown headfirst through three rings of fire and into a glass coffin the coffin is slowly being filled with acid while walls adorned with spikes begin closing in youre awfully excited to see how this guy is going to get out of it when you hear a bloodcurdling scream in the row behind you someone has fainted you ask yourself why a show this grandiose and elaborate isnt being attended by more people then it dawns on you that maybe theres a reason that guy in the alley was running so quickly maybe the gentleman who has been thrown into a seemingly escapeproof solution isnt meant to escape at all thats what this movie is like its a nightmare that scares you but is addictive so you cant turn away you see our main character getting into a situation that just keeps getting worse and worse sometimes its his own fault sometimes it isnt it would be a dreadful depressing experience if it wasnt for two things the first is that there is a way out of this or at least in theory there is you dont quite understand what happened here but you know that its only a matter of time before this whole thing blows over and our hero sets the record straight right? the second is the mystery what did happen? where did amy go? what part did nick have in her disappearance if any? who is responsible and why? as the film plays out you will be treated to one devastating and headspinning revelation after another every time you think you have something figured out a new wrench is thrown in the mechanism and it begins to crumble all over again to give it a whole new level of intensity the film is incredibly realistic and airtight in its developments the characters feel genuine and have real depth to them the moments of incredible tension are often broken by moments of nervous laughter as the characters involved try to steel themselves against this nightmare they have found themselves in the script and the story are razorsharp in their wit and intelligence gillian flynn the author of the novel did an incredible job as an added bonus the performances are super intense i have unfortunately come to associate tyler perry with wooden performances unless hes in a dress but he is very good in this film everyone is really good in this film in fact you will see the cast list at the beginning of the movie and you will barely be able to recognize some of the actors because the roles and performances they are showing off here are unlike anything youve seen before i also really admire the  by trent reznor and atticus ross who did a terrific job in david finchers girl with the dragon tattoo and once again amplify the eerie and tense atmosphere of the film without distracting you from the action or resorting to cheap musical cues this film lasts over two hours and it left me wanting more i didnt see the time fly by at all because it is never slow in fact it only gets more intense as the minutes tick by and that ending absolutely perfect i was all sweaty nervous and fearful when i left the theater even though i had a friend to reassure me that everything was going to be perfectly safe i dont know what else i can tell you about this film i give it my highest recommendation there is a reason why every time i went to check this one out at the theater it was full to the brim this time i decided to bite the bullet and grab some crappy seats near the front just so i could finally see it it was worth it gone girl is so intense that i absolutely have to watch it again and soon theatrical version on the big screen october 18 2014positive,gone girl is fascinating and an interesting and amusing take on a dysfunctional marriage arent all marriages dysfunctional? i would rather recommend that one should not approach the movie as a mystery suspense or thriller movie because that is secondary the real story is the functioning of a couple the real genre is the marriage when two people passionately in love come together to tie the knot and say their till death do us part what happens? are those fairy tales we watch real? do we all live happily ever after? the brilliance of the movie lies in its surreal story that is told in an unambiguous definitive way there is not a shadow of doubt to as what happened in the movie but the story itself comes somewhere from the dark recesses of the emotional labyrinthine a thought we dared not to think an idea killed at its inception that is what gone girl does and that is exactly what fincher loves to do tap the darkness but its darkness is also why sometimes movie indulges in excesses it is as if fincher just couldnt get enough of it and overdoes it like a child bestowed with the toys he had wanted all along fincher just couldnt let it go also up to three fourths of the movie the scale seems to be nicely balanced between rosamund pike and ben affleck but after that ben affleck seems like a victim and the wife as the abuser which many may think to be misogynistic in portrayal but for me it was just unfair and a blot in otherwise a brilliant take on marriage in spite of these flaws gone girl is a fantastic movie gone girl ridicules the notion of true love set by the standards of our happily ever afters and the happiness in marriage that this society preaches our insatiable diet for the happily ever afters but then the movie also talks about the beauty of it as both confess they bring out the best of each other and it is what makes it so twisted and self destructive a deal with the devil apart from love and marriage the movie also sets out to give light to the illusory nature of perception propagandized by the media the movie in the first half is itself ripe of manipulation and debauchery feeding off the ideas that we are too eager and judgemental to make and how fincher mocks at us brilliantly acted by rosamund pike with an able support from ben affleck and rest of the cast it is a must watch i loved it and the ending was perfect any other ending would have just spoiled the whole movie for me for me the blood stained rosamund pike in the arms of ben affleck with affleck whispering bitch in her ears while the crowd applauds true love will remain the most iconic romantic scene ever that scene in itself is an antithesis to all those stories of soul mates and happily ever afters a necessary antidote to our misplaced modern lovepositive,gone girl is fantastic there i said it its one of the most thrilling american movies ive seen in the past five years however i cant say im surprised david fincher is known for bringing us milestones in cinema being responsible for classics such as fight club and seven and you can easily add his latest film to the long list of spellbinding and transfixing movies hes been a part of not only is it a genius piece of art but its daring in its storytelling especially considering how wide of an audience the film has set in a small missouri town it centers around nick dunne ben affleck a man who may or may not have killed his wife at least thats what everyones trying to figure out his wife goes missing hes suspected and we watch things unravel from there its riveting strangely creepy at times and isnt afraid to show sexuality which most mainstream films are too afraid to touch not to mention the exceptional performances from the whole cast mainly our two leads affleck and rosamund pike but also from other standouts like tyler perry and kim dickens one of my favorite aspects was the little splices of comedy that seemed to break up the more tense moments showing how impeccable the writing is and you when you couple that with the beautiful cinematography you have a near perfect film i urge you to the see this it may split audiences but i enjoyed it endlessly and cant wait to see it again its a prime example of what cinema can and should bepositive,gone girl is directed by the mastermind of david fincher amazingly written by gillian flynn whom wrote the novel the film is based on starring ben affleck as nick dunne and rosamund pike as amy elliot dunne on the day of their 5th wedding anniversary nicks wife amy disappears out of nowhere and this crazy intense and haunting journey begins david fincher and gillian flynns intelligent storytelling trough out this fantastic journey will keep at the edge of your seat from start to end the soundtrack and  is also very intense and haunting and has huge impact on the film the performances from all the actors especially rosamund pike are top notch which really helps the element of the realism stand out in this film gone girl is easily the best film i have seen this year so far and i have to give it a 1010 it is also one of the best films from david fincher in my opinion i strongly advice everyone to go and see gone girl it is one thrilling ridepositive,gone girl is a very dark mystery film it has all of the elements of a who done it story however this film has a twist the film has a big twist when the twist happens the film switches gears the film is about two and a half hours long but that doesnt matter when i watch the film i feel like time flys and im left wanting more thats a good thing the film is extremely fast paced so youre going to have to keep up i truly believe that this film deserves at least three viewings for someone to really enjoy it if you watch this movie again and again then youll pick up on things that you didnt know were there the  to this amazing film is eerie and also haunting i feel like the music really blends in well with the story and scenes being played out on screen the performances in this film are a mixed bag i feel like ben affleck does his job but he doesnt give a oscar worthy performance i also feel that all of the other actors in the film only did their jobs however rosamund pike knocks it out of the park im glad rosamund is nominated for a academy award in my personal opinion rosamund pike out acts everyone in this movie this is rosamund pikes movie rosamund is a rising star i hope she continues to get roles as juicy as her role in gone girl the film is full of twist and turns and i dont think youre ever going to guess what happens next this isnt your typical who done it movie this isnt your typical mystery thriller in my personal opinion this is director david finchers best work since seven if you really want to be entertained if you really want to be on the edge of your seat and if you really want to watch a film that will shock you then i highly recommend gone girl for anyone who likes to be surprisedpositive,gone girl is a tour de force of modern cinema it combines that best of both worlds those worlds being 90s fincher and 2000s fincher it has the intricate multiperspective narrative of the social network the interplay of media and crime reminiscent of zodiac the playful surrealism of the game the brash blood and gore of se7en and of course like fight club it had that indefatigable story twisting and turning at every point imaginable and taking the audience on an unforgettable cinematic experience it was particularly joyful to see such well written female characters the centerpiece being amy dunne played by the hollywood newcomer rosamund pike like an amoral lisabeth salander amy presents a terrifying image of female vengeance it was good to see a filmmaker known for his sausagefest films expand to include a more balanced cast where women arent reduced to sexual objects im looking at you the social network i hope this marks a new era of fincher one which balances intelligent sophisticated filmmaking with loads and loads of dark twisted fun 1010positive,gone girl could be the best film so far this year but viewer discretion is defiantly advised the film follows nick and amy dunn a newly wed couple settling into life in missouri but it that all changes when amy goes missing the entire country jumps on board to try and help find amy and slowly everyone starts turning on nick the back nice guy that is pretty oblivious to everything around him but if you think you have this movie figured out think again the good stuff its directed by david fincher one of the most ambitious dark directors of the modern age and hes done it again the script is very tightly written movies based on books tend to either flop or are critically praised but when you have the author of the book writing the screenplay not much can go wrong the dark humor that is sprinkled in is perfect for the scenes that its used in and is often hilarious the film has a mood surrounding it that is unlike any movie you will ever see through out you are at the edge of your seat yet also constantly looking behind you as a deeply unsettling feeling creeps over your body this is in large part thanks to the performances by the leads ben affleck and rosamund pike are so terrific in there roles as well as just about everyone else the bad stuff well like i said there isnt to much that can go wrong when the books author is on board helping write there is really only one thing that i didnt like in this film near the beginning there was a lot of nudity now dont get me wrong im ok with it as long as it helps to obtain what the film is going for which closer to the end its used perfectly but the nudity at the beginning feels completely unnecessary and forced and there wasnt much shortage of it either the verdict gone girl is without a doubt one of the best films of the year featuring outstanding acting superb writing and just an overall mood to it that is unlike anything in film but some of the nudity took me out of the movie because of how forced it feltpositive,gone girl begins slowly with a lot of questions and clues and progressively ramps up until it grabs a hold of you and doesnt let go this is not the first glowing review for gone girl nor will it be the last its an odd mix of thriller mystery and drama with enough giggleworthy dialogue thrown into it to make it truly unique it is gripping from the very beginning and hangs on to your attention until the credits roll gone girls running time is 2 hours and 29 minutes but it never feels forced or dragged out in fact the only disappointment was that it ended at all aside from affleck who is perfect in his role of the lost husband making all the wrong moves in the ensuing media storm the cast of females in the film is what gives it its punch rosamund pike is truly amazing and saying anything else beyond that would be giving too much away it is a film that relies on suspense and genuine shock so providing any more details in a review would be a disservice supporting actress carrie coon takes on the role as the bold tellitlikeitis twin sister margo and kim dickens is the bright lead detective assigned to the case both are very compelling and often funny as nick slowly pieces everything together surrounding his wifes sudden disappearance the movie is based on a best selling novel of the same name by gillian flynn and one can only imagine how good the book is based on the success and reception of the film so far given the detail in the movie its hard to believe there could be more to the story that just didnt make the cut the instant buzzing of discussion and the looks of pure astonishment and joy on the faces of the moviegoers once gone girl ended said it all its still early with oscar season right around the corner but this is easily the best movie of the year so farpositive,gone girl based on the criticallyacclaimed best selling novel of the same name by gillian flynn here we have a thrilling engaging picture that will keep you constantly doubting yourself just when you think youve sussed it out the story for those that havent read the book revolves around the disappearance of nicks ben afflecks wife amy with rosamund pike playing the titular role split into a solid three acts each one will have you confused  in a good way  more than the last with you either rooting team nick or team amy for who you think is in the right  or the wrong some powerful narrative is provided by pike which only aids in the deep story and gives insight into the characters inner thoughts at two and a half hours long its a lengthy sitter but being so engrossed in the film as you are you will hardly notice so an achey bum shouldnt be a worry each member of the cast are fantastic in their roles especially praising pike who  really stealing the show  convincingly shows us her idea of crazy bitch wife brilliant none the less neil patrick harris of how i met your mother fame also gives a great side performance as illfated creepy stalking ex desi this has to be one of if not the film of the year no fantasy no science fiction this is something that could happen which makes it all the more compelling david fincher  director of oscar winners the social network the curious case of benjamin button and nominee fight club  adds another picture to his impressive portfolio and with it a sure best picture winnerpositive,gone girl 2014 directed by david fincher i have been waiting for this movie for some time now being a david fincher fan and all and boy i wasnt disappointed ben affleck stars as nick dunn a writer that one certain night falls in love amy elliot played beautifully by rosamund pike it begins pretty well the love flows between the two however as time passes love fades away five years after originally meeting nick comes home to see that his wife disappeared from here on out the media begins to blame nick for the disappearance this is a great movie everyone on screen feels well placed however i dont think neil patrick harris was the best choice for his character he is by far the weakest point of the movie although tyler perry is great absolutely amazing choice the cinematography is wonderful youve come to expect that from a fincher film the  does justice to the experience and the screenplay done by the very author of the book it is based on is in fact fantastic it keeps getting darker and darker and well you got the point the movie is fantastic the weakest thing i can think of it is neal patrick harris castingpositive,Geoffrey Chaucers Canterbury Tales was a frame story: there was one overall story/link that binded all the characters they met at the inn on the road which is at the beginning and end of the story but in between are mini-stories about each of the travellers. Pulp Fiction is a modern version. The frame in this case is the Diner which is where like Chaucers inn the main characters meet. In between we get mini-storys like Butchs tale the Knight if you will Vincents tale the Sailor and Jules tale the Monk. Each is interwoven with the other except that chronologically they are out of synch Butch wastes Vincent in his tale but Vincent is in the Diner frame part of the story. The dialog is sharp and has some serious hidden meanings at times--Tarintino is notorious like Stephen King for lacing the dialog with pop-culture references. Witness the scene outside Jack Rabbit Slims where Mia asks Vincent Youre not a square Daddy-O are you and proceeds to draw a square in the air ala Pebbles Flintstone. This blurring of the films reality with our reality lets you know Tarintino is not some by the books director with no sense of what Joe Bagofdonuts does--he watches TV too Kevin Williamsons re-writing of the horror film rules owes alot to Pulp Fiction and its acknowledgement of just who is going to see movies these days. Rent it buy it... the bonus cut footage alone is worth a look.positive,FYI: The following is my very first movie review. After watching the trilogy for 100 literally times that was kind of a vow I finally decided to write a review on it. The very first thing I noticed the first time I watched it was NONE I couldnt understand a word of it because my English was so bad and the picture was so blurry that might seem awkward but the DVD I got at that time wasnt original. It was actually filmed illegally in a movie theater by the way that is quite usual in my country. Two years later I was a changed man. I became familiar with the IMDb and developed a particular interest in movies in myself. In my journey through the Top 250 list I gave the Dark Knight another try this time the DVD was genuine AND IT WAS UNBELIEVABLE The movie I never respected was actually the best again literally movie I have ever seen First of all there was technically very little CGI and that is absolutely respectable and special for a superhero movie. Secondly it really demonstrated the very nature soul and idea before all the superheroes: sometimes truth isnt good enough sometimes people deserve more sometimes they deserve to have their faith rewarded. We cannot live on our own we need and we deserve mythical superiors to help us. Sometimes the truth is too unbearable that we have no other choice but to replace it misinterpret it with a myth a lie. The myth could be A GOD GODS or even heroes: imaginary but inspiring. After all not to offend the ones who believe the God or gods is also made by the imagination of the Man although the passing of time might make us to think that they are real but they are not. It is also noteworthy to understand the magnitude and the immortality of an idea and the trilogy represents this concept perfectly just like V for Vendetta. Last but not least it does not help to pretend that you are strong and it might even bring horrible harm to you. If the reality is too dark you just need to open the door and go outside.positive,full disclosure ive read the book and think this is more than a cracking adaptation its a near total improvement across the board that said i became so caught up with the shape of the adaptation that a second viewing will better clarify the meanings at work what gone girl is about more than mystery misogyny money or any other mword if you think you have truth on your side youre clueless i spent so much of it grinning from ear to ear the humor is as pitch black as youve heard with one punchline near the end thats way too easy youll know it when you hear it but still finchers in fine form he and editor kirk baxter massage the 25 hour runtime into a steadily compelling thriller affleck and pike are both excellent each walking the emotional razors edge that fincher and writer flynn have established for them the script is a marvelous adaptation in the sense that it keeps so much of flynns original text and improving on it in more than a few cases still if theres a reason gone girl can occasionally strike its points a little too explicitly it can be linked to the script these instances are few and far between however the lasting impression of gone girl is that its a twisting and twisted popular entertainment likely to see few equals on american cineplex screens this yearpositive,From the beginning to the end this film is brilliant. The direction writing acting and music are all top rate and bring together a masterpiece of a film. The story-line does a fantastic job on reflecting the darker side of the Batman comics but still brings across Nolans own take on the characters as seen in Batman Begins 2005. This is my personal favourite of the the franchise and my favourite movie of all time and the fact that it has made its way into the IMDb top ten reflects this opinion. I have enjoyed every Christopher Nolan movie I have seen and this is definitely his best. Whether youre a Batman fan or not. I highly recommend seeing this film. 10/10positive,From start to finish this is a true masterpiece Tarantino is a genius and it comes out in this film one of the most inspirational films going Plus the only film that i seen which can make Bruce Willis into more of a bad ass this has some iconic scenes including when Mia takes Vincent to jack rabbit slim As well as amazing music Vincent is funny and the only Q i have is  is Vincent dead or not EPIC this lead onto some other great films such as Inglorious bastards  DJANGO AND many other iconic Tarantino Films If you want a laugh then this film is for you  if you want a life changing experience this is for you an all star cast including  Walken  Plummer  Roth  Thurman  Travolta and of course SAMUEL l Jacksonpositive,from start to finish i had nothing but fun with guardians of the galaxy it has one of the best soundtracks ive heard in a long time part of me cannot wait for the sequel just so i get to hear awesome mix vol 2 i can honestly say that i did not hate any of the characters which is very rare for me as their is usually at least one character that i just cannot bear to watch every character served their purpose and seemed necessary as soon as guardians of the galaxy becomes available on dvd i am sure it will very rarely see the inside of its case whilst in my housepositive,From my reading the books in school all the movies were kept as true as possible. And it was like following the books in synchro. The return of the king was the greatest movie of all time the beautiful land scapes and character builds kept me riveted through out the entire trilogy. Peter Jackson by far right now is quite possibly the most elite director to come to Hollywood. He is now next to James Cameron and also Cecill B Demile for Oscar wins from a movie. Gaining 11 wins with numerous other awards that has helped mold his career even more. This film is absolutely breath taking in scope as well as the deep camaraderie in the story line where not all soldiers are only made to fight. But they are made to understand life through combat. To see each others struggles and hopes and dreams nearly smashed by an ultimate evil. Yet triumph through poise and audacity to look evil in the eye and come through with a friends life in one hand and a sword in the other. A true pinnacle in movie making.positive,Frankly speaking i am not a great fan of American comic book heroes. i think it is mainly because in India we have our own bunch of comic book super heroes. yes of course they havent made their entry to the big screen till now but we can expect few of them in the upcoming years. i am 22 and have my own stuff to do. thats the reason why i never get time for super hero fantasies. There are only two international super heroes that i like the most. One is Batman and the other is Spider Man. one major reason due to which i like them is that they are practically vulnerable still fighting for the justice. i became the spider man fan after watching the 3 spider man films directed by Sam Raimi. And became a Batman fan just after watching The Dark Knight. The plot the action sequences as well as the soundtrack... all were exceptionally well done. This is certainly the best superhero film ever made. He is not just a hero.... but he is more than that. Most of the people believe that death is the ultimate sacrifice a superhero can make. but it is not true. few sacrifices are extreme than the death. this is what one can know about Batman from this movie. For him concern for people was more important than his ego. Thats the reason why he successfully protected the people of Gotham from the masterstroke of a sociopath known only as The Joker. In my viewpoint this is Nolans best work till date and Memento of course. Watch this film... youll never regret it. While concluding my review i would like to share a list of top 10 movies with everyone. I am not saying this is a perfect list but these films can deliver you the best worth of your time and money. 1. Rocky 1976 2. 12 Angry Men 1957 3. The Dark Knight 2008 4. Its a Wonderful Life 1946 5. The Godfather 1972 6. Schindlers List 1993 7. Citizen Kane 1941/ The City of God 2002 8. The Shawshank Redemption 1994 9. American History X 1998 10. Braveheart 1995positive,Forget these gentle little films like Lost in Translation or Station Agent -- this is what I call a REAL movie. It is outstanding in every way. While I felt the first two LOTR films dragged and I couldnt get into them this final chapter kept my interest from the opening scene. Truly spectacularpositive,Forget the great things youve heard about The Dark Knight. No matter how lavish the praise or how determined the hyperbole its all understatement. The Dark Knight is I suppose the greatest superhero movie ever made but its so far beyond the limited men in tights genre that attempting to compare it with movies like Spider-Man Superman or even Batman Begins is almost laughable. Director Christopher Nolans film trumps everything and everyone including himself. Its not just the best superhero movie ever made its one of the best movies ever to show up in a theater. More than a film about a man in a mask trying to stop the bad guy or save the innocent its the story of a city and its people trapped between an unstoppable force and an immovable object. Gotham City is at the center of everything while two men each mad in their own way fight to control the hearts and minds of its populace. The Joker Heath Ledger bursts onto the scene and correctly pronounces himself the living embodiment of chaos. This is a man who cares for nothing and wants nothing except to watch the world crumble around him. Nolan wastes no time explaining Jokers origin he is a force of nature and as such has always existed. Faced with pure chaos given form the people of Gotham turn to selfish terror and the Joker laughs gleefully as we watch them dance to his tune. Opposing him is Batman Christian Bale embodying the pursuit of single-minded justice and hoping for the best in mankind he seeks to inspire them to something better through living symbols like Gothams new District Attorney Harvey Dent Aaron Eckhart or top cop Lt. James Gordon Gary Oldman. In the end it doesnt matter whether Batman captures Joker or Joker takes out Batman. What matters is which of them wins the battle for Gotham Citys soul. The genius of Heath Ledgers performance as Joker is that in a way youll almost find yourself rooting for him to win. Let him burn it down if only so we can see how hell make it happen. Ledgers Joker is easily the best on screen villain since Star Trek IIs Khan a performance unlike anything else youve seen. He is at once funny and terrifying. Hell make you laugh at all the wrong moments and then cringe in unspeakable terror at all the others. His peals of laughter bounce through the film echoing long after the credits roll and leaving Jokers mark not just on this movie but on cinema. Hes an instant icon. The Oscar buzz for what Ledger has done is not premature. He drives the entire movie with his performance embodying something so out of control and his own way so true that the whirlwind of his mere presence destroys all comers. What Im getting at here is that most of whats going on in The Dark Knight is mental. Its not that there isnt action theres plenty of it but even when Batman is running around punching people in the head or racing through the streets on his incredible visually stunning gadgets its the psychology of whats happening pushes the story. Because of that the problems Nolan had directing some of the action sequences in Batman Begins are utterly erased here. Batman lurks in the shadows dispatching bad guys with a single punch. There are no extended complicated fight scenes for him to botch because quite frankly the movie doesnt need them. Theres plenty of fighting but it happens in quick encounters staged one after another with a kind of lyrical precision I havent seen in anything outside of the action-poetry in last years The Bourne Ultimatum. When Batman is forced into an extended showdown it takes the form of a brutal economical beating with punches landed with vicious force and battles being waged by men who have made themselves blunt instruments. What makes the action so arresting is the force of will behind it the philosophical battle driving it. Youll be on the edge of your seat for every single moment whether its a simple conversation at Bruce Waynes office or a balls to the wall brawl inside a gangster-infested Hong Kong skyscraper.positive,for years I have been hearing about this movie pulp fiction I would always hear about it see references to it and Id ask people what the movie was about and none of them could explain so years pass and Im scrolling through Netflix I see pulp fiction and Ive been a fan of Quentin Tarantino for a long time and his great works from inglorious basterds to kill bill so I start watching and from the first talk about robbing banks without robbing them and just the whole idea of it all made me wanna robs bank to without robbing it hahaha and you realize what makes this movie is what makes every Tarentino movie and thats why I love his work the DIALOGUE dialogue dialogue dialogue very movie is all about the plot just shoving and cramming the plot down your throat but Tarantino can make a movie on how to bake cookies and itll be so good by diolague alone and now I understand why people couldnt explain it this movie really has no plot this movie is just about 3 interconnected events not in order one about a hit-man who gets more than he bargained for when he takes his bosses wife out on a date upon his bosss request 2 about a washed up boxer who makes a deal with the said hit-mans boss to fix a fight and screws him over which hints at the honor among thieves theme later that episode and lastly the hit-man and his partner accidentally kill their informant and have to get rid of the body  while it doesnt have the innocence of Reservoir Dogs or the maneuverability of the Kill Bill series it definitely stands on its own It is also one of the more charming and highly appealing of the Generation X stoner flicks Let me just say that if I could give this movie beyonder points Id give it a 16 for eerily supernatural Great great work positive,For years Batman fans and film fans alike had been waiting for the ultimate Batman film a film that embodies everything about the character from the tragic story to the humane methods. Christopher Nolan finally gives the fans what they crave in this film right from the beginning the tension builds the action gets bolder and bolder the stakes get higher and higher there are pulsating battles there are heartbreaking losses. We get to see Batmans fall from grace what it truly takes to try and save a city. Spiderman 2 was previously the pinnacle of superhero films this film raises the bar even higher if only Nolan would of given us a fourth entry to his series  Darn what a good movie But I need to say this sometimes it happens.. So WHY do people love this movie and rate it high when or WHY isnt the smart people declare it like a a peace of art Or do they Still I think its darn good...but I bet the producers didnt expect that Like when we vote for anything we need to follow our heart. This is a typical movie that is worth every penny every letter... and its a typical 90 movie Oh.. there we have it Between gone with the wind and now we NEED this love me as I am.. says the storyline in my head anyway. And I do yes I do positive,for tom cruise fans and nonfans alike this wonderful thriller is so well crafted that it took my breath away many people even profession film critics didnt understand it perhaps it is too well written yes it is complex yes it is written for people with an attention span greater than a 3 year olds  you must pay attention but it does make sense every single second of the film is important director brian de palma gives us the unexpected at every turn his visuals as always are exciting the entire cast is fine but it is de palmas movie all the way one of the best films of the 90spositive,For those unfamiliar with writer/director Quentin Tarantinos cult masterpiece Pulp Fiction it is a twisted combination of plots that capture the very pulp of society that are evident in its title. The plot is a non-linear combination of three main stories that intertwine with the five main characters popping in and out of all of them. All three of the stories are very simplistic in theory and purposely made stereotypical by Tarantino. However his goal was to take these classic mobster stories and add a twist to all of them. It is these aspects of Tarantinos stories that change the formula from something generic and unoriginal to three of the most intense and memorable stories of film history. The glue that progresses and ties all of these stories together is the sharp natural dialogue that Tarantino is so well known for. He is at the top of his game in Pulp Fiction providing the most natural and genuinely interesting dialogue that not only serves as something to listen to but also actually progresses the story just as much as the characters actions do. These actions are actually what the film is most criticized for with the movie being rated R for almost everything. Some claim that the movie is just an excuse to set up extreme situations of violence and substance abuse. This has caused the film to be known for its excessive and brutal nature. However when paying closer attention it is quite easy to see that it is largely a story of redemption. Since the film revolves around less than moral individuals it is not surprising to say that everyone who is killed in this movie could easily be considered a bad person but when examined one will notice that every character that seeks forgiveness for their actions is alive when the credits roll. The soupy morals and excessive nature are what this movie is known for. For good reasons too further supporting the choice for the title of the movie. However the reason this movie has reached a certain level of greatness over the years is not only from its drugs and violence but also from its tangled story superb dialogue. With Pulp Fiction being the masterpiece of a director as talented as Quentin Tarantino any movie fan owes it to themselves to see it.positive,for those of us who have wondered if there will ever be an action thriller without the usual mixes seen over and over all these years yes this is the one do not wait to read till the end of my review go grab your tickets and watch it already in case you still havent throughout the movie pretty much only these happened with the audience in repetition laughing a lot wolfwhistling  clutching head a little bit of shock and lots of awe must mention  taron egertons jaw will make you swoon i guess it was so good thanks to that charming crisp script detailed character sketches incredible cast and and that bgm  and stunt sequence i should add a bit of the violence may not be well received but it is exactly that which makes it better for some of us this has easily got to be matthew vaughns best yet in fact the freshest new age action thriller in a long long time euphoric was how i felt in comparison other mass entertainers will fade in leaving that lasting feeling long after the movie gets over but not this one no as quoted several times throughout the 2 hour run time this aint that kind of moviepositive,For the people who are not aware of the concept and the style that Quentin Tarantino uses for most of his movies Tarantinos films involve a lot of blood violence strong language and profanity and most of his films are not told in a continuous manner they keep on switching between time periods like Past and Present Tarantino takes his style and concept and pushes it to the absolute max in Pulp Fiction and this resulted in arguably the greatest film he ever made Pulp Fiction tells 3 different interrelated stories with one main character the first storys main protagonist is Vincent John Travolta the main protagonist of the second story is Butch Bruce Willis and Jules Samuel L Jackson is the main protagonist in the third with Vincent playing a very strong supporting role The film also includes a prologue and epilogue and these stories are also shown non chronologically This film uses such a unique format that chronologically the events of the epilogue take place just moments after the prologue and the three stories told in the middle take place before or after the events of the prologue/epilogue Pulp Fiction is one of those films that would have perhaps not been as entertaining if it had been shown in a chronological order its non linear format of storytelling is definitely one of its highest points keeps the viewer thinking and interpreting This is a major benefit because the viewer can just choose to watch one story at the time and still be entertained and will still feel like that he watched a short flick and there will be a sense of completion All storys can also be re-watched chronologically to watch the film from a different perspective The film can also be re-watched in the current order it is in to comprehend the film in its entirety The films replay value is tremendously high I watched it around 10 times and always found it entertaining Pulp Fiction does not hold the viewer on the edge of his seat to find out what will happen next but to think about what transpired earlier and what led to the current situation For example: Vincent and Jules went to do their job all dressed sup in suits and couple of hours later they go to bar to meet their boss in shorts and t shirts at first I thought it was a glaring oversight but this is heavily explained later on and I was extremely surprised with the events that led to this sudden change of attire The films three stories are not that in depth or engaging neither is the overall plot of the film but the plot is still funny interesting and keeps us engaged throughout the three stories also inspired by short films that Tarantino is a fan of brands that Tarentino loves and B Grade movies that Tarentino likes they all appear this is a Quentin Tarantino movie through and through and his fingerprints are all over it he himself makes a cameo in this film and despite not being a trained actor does a decent job The dialogue is the films greatest point some really awesome fantastic and memorable dialogues are spoken throughout this entire film that they are being quoted to this very day This film does not want to directly take you into the action when Vincent and Jules first went to do their job they didnt get directly into they talked about a series of unrelated events which were all interesting to listen they are criminals about to commit a crime but to them it is just another day at work they are co workers and friends and they are gossiping Another example is Bruce betrayed Marsellus Wallace and killed someone he is on the run but decides to smoke in the hired cab and discuss with the taxi driver in detail about what he just did Another example would be us Bruce Willis going around his houses yard rather than the film directly starting the scene with him entering through his houses front door in the yard scene the camera focuses closely behind Butch to keep us on the edge of out seats and expect someone to attack him although nothing happens Pulp Fiction has many pop culture references and also involves some serious and controversial subjects likes miracles drugs mob bosses taking dives betting homosexuality rape all these subjects are depicted in the film The soundtrack and full length songs that are used are really good and just are fun to listen the main theme and ending themes are also excellent tracks The acting is fantastic Samuel L Jackson steals the show with his natural roles as Jules John Travolta regains his former glory and fame with his excellent performance as Vincent Uma Thurman as Mia Wallace was also great and Bruce Willis is also portrays the Butch character very well There are many awesome cameos throughout the film where the actors deliver their lines and perform their roles almost perfectly my favorite however must be Christoper Walkens short cameo and the sentimental story he tells about the Golden Watch All other minor characters like Tim Roth and Amanda Plummer also do a commendable job n their short roles In conclusion I want to say that Pulp Fiction is an astonishingly unique film which does not have a deep story and there is hardly any morale to the story but a tremendously entertaining film with a fun plot brilliant and absolutely mind blowing dialogue with tons of pop culture references and social commentary It is simple a Masterpiece without a message and arguably Quentin Tarantinos best movie Overall: 95/10positive,For the past week Id been pining to complete my rewatch of The Lord of the Rings 2001-2003 viewing the films for the first time in years. This wait however arduous was nothing compared to the 360 days I originally endured between The Two Towers 2002 and The Return of the King 2003. The drought came to an end on December 26 2003: I remember the exact date because it was the first night of release and Id been counting down for the past year. We bought our tickets weeks in advance waited in line for over an hour and my brother emptied a packet of jelly lollies over the row in front of us while trying to get the damn packet open. And so it is that Peter Jacksons trilogy-to-end-all-trilogies finally came to a close in truly spectacular fashion. With the armies of Mordor marching on Minas Tirith Gandalf Ian McKellen and Aragorn Viggo Mortensen must recruit the aid of alternative reinforcements if the land of Gondor ruled by the callous steward Denethor John Noble is not to fall before the Great Eye of Sauron. Meanwhile this epic conflict is contrasted against the image of two little hobbits Frodo and Sam dutifully trundling across the wastelands of Mordor two innocuous Halflings carrying the weight of a million men. Once again the film excels at these stunning contrasts. The death of Denethor a powerful intimate moment of self-realisation unexpectedly bridges into the Battle for Minas Tirith the loss of one man suddenly absorbed into the slaughter of thousands. A word of warning: arachnophobics should be weary of Frodos excursion into Shelobs Lair a magnificent work of grotesquerie visual effects topped only by the insect pit in Jacksons own King Kong 2005. Andy Serkis as the computer-generated Gollum once again brings pathos and fragility into the role of the tormented former Ring-bearer. The Return of the King has perhaps the most unforgettable final hour Ive ever seen as the fate of all that is good comes down to a scrappy scuffle on the edge of a fiery precipice this one-on-one conflict somehow more epic than the entire Battle of Helms Deep. But Peter Jackson isnt done yet. While excising Tolkiens somewhat anti-climactic Scouring of the Shire he nevertheless brings the trilogy to a graceful and wonderfully satisfying close his leisurely winding-down approach doing justice to one of the richest fantasy sagas ever told.positive,For the first time since its theater release I have just finished The Lord of the Rings Trilogy. Which is by far the greatest trilogy ever made. There were too many spectacular traits of this film that it was almost impossible to remember all of them. There was a terrific musical  epic battle scenes that last for about a 1 hour span time great characters and greatly succeeded on making you feel the worst of everything then comes back around for all hope to be regained. This is basically speaking upon the entire trilogy since it is pretty much one big film. It is completely understandable why this film won every single Oscar for which it was nominated in but one thing that was wrong was that it wasnt nominated for enough things. This film should have been nominated and won all categories that it would be qualified for. There were amazing visual effects and spectacular set design. I was blown away by the fact that I thought such effects and designs could ever be achieved by anyone. There were no flaws in any part of the film no revealing mistakes and it was absolutely flawless. The characters in The Return of the King were the same as always marvelous. There was a spectacular build up to feeling the proper emotions in which were meant to be shown and perfectly developed them in every way possible. There was hatred feelings and emotions attached to each character to feel everything that was meant to be felt. Each actor was phenomenal in every aspect and seemed to be a perfect fit for everything. The greatest thing above all though was the epic tale. There were subplots that made the movie much more epic and entertaining than anything I have ever seen before. There were suspenseful moments with a giant tarantula attacking the characters battle scenes that last for a seemingly eternity and made you feel the very worst of everything that could happen. This truly is a masterpiece that can be seen over and over again but will keep you right where you sit and you will not leave your seat until the very end.

of its time not to mention times thereafter It was followed by a deluge of copycats and wannabes none of which quite matched the staggering bravura of this film Š—– we really are talking here about a movie which epitomises that old dictum the original and still the best In this nonlinear trilogy of gangland stories Š—– stuffed to the brim with crackling dialogue pop culture references stylised gunplay and jet black humour Š—– Quentin Tarantino delivers an audacious and endlessly watchable movie at once rewriting and redefining the whole style of the crime genre The first story deals with hit men Jules Samuel L Jackson and Vincent John Travolta as they track down a briefcase full of something valuable stolen from their boss Marcellus Wallace Ving Rhames by a group of young opportunists Later that evening against the advice of Jules Vincent escorts Marcelluss wife Mia Uma Thurman on a dinner date which spirals out of control with almost tragic consequences The second story follows down-at-heel boxer Butch Bruce Willis who has been bribed by Marcellus to throw a fight Butch doesnt keep his end of the bargain pummelling his opponent to death in the ring before making a hasty getaway Later Butch attempts to flee from the city but first needs to retrieve a family heirloom Š—– a precious watch Š—– from his apartment His attempts to recover the watch set into motion a crazy

little problem And even then their eventful day is far from overŠ—_ as next they inadvertently get caught up in an impromptu coffee shop heist masterminded by Pumpkin Tim Roth and Honey Bunny Amanda Plummer While the narrative structure of Pulp Fiction is devilishly clever the plot itself doesnt matter much in the grand scheme of things The plot merely provides a backdrop against which the characters can interact Š—– the film generates infinite fascination in its rich yet random conversations where the characters chat casually about things like foot massages European fast food joints classic TV shows piercings and why pigs are filthy animals plus much much more Whatever else you say about Tarantino hes the best there is when it comes to writing terrific passages of dialogue Š—– theres nothing in cinema quite like a Tarantino conversation Choosing a favourite performance from the remarkable ensemble work is almost impossible  everyone is in dynamic form though it is perhaps Jackson as the bible-bashing smart-mouthed hit-man Jules who leaves the most lasting impression His career post- Pulp Fiction has been quite simply a twenty year success story Theres an abundance of terrific individual scenes too Š—– the adrenalin- shot-to-the-heart sequence in which Vincent saves Mia from a drug overdose  the clean-up of Marvins corpse after being accidentally shot by Vincent

had seen this movie move up the IMDb ladder and make its way to becoming #1 I was a bit irritated being that it took the spot of The Godfather however this was before I had ever laid my eyes on even a trailer for this film so I researched through the credits and found out that it was based on a novel by one of my favorite writers Stephen King I know what your thinking how could he be one of my favorite writers if I didnt even have a clue about this Masterpiece. July 24 2010 was my movie day I promised myself I was going to stay up 24 Hours watching some of my favorite Films I started of at around 12:45 with the controversial sadistic genius masterpiece that is A Clockwork Orange then after my brain was through with Ultra-Violence I proceeded watching the best sequel ever made in the History of cinema The Godfather Part II then after I felt like a Corleone I started watching the Coen Brothers Masterpiece No Country For Old Men then after feeling lost I started watching Pulp Fiction and after that the time was around 4:30 P.M. and I broke my promise to myself and took what I thought was going to be a 2 Hour Nap which turned into a 6 Hour Intermission I woke up around 10:00 deciding which movie I was going to watch and I wanted it to be a Classic I had never seen I was thinking 12 Angry Men but for some reason I wanted to see what the all this fuss was about when it came to Shawkshank Redemption so I rented it and started watching around 11:45 P.M. Let me just say after this movie left an Impact in my Life and Mind I now actually know why it is #1 on this site and it is for good reason this movie made me laugh hysterically at times like in Animal House it made me think like Fight Club does at times it made me frightened like The Shining at times and I have no other movie to reference my Sobbing emotions with because no other film has made me Cry and that should tell you that after a day of Great Films this one had the biggest Impact on me.positive,For a long time movies about super-heroes havent had much off an effect from regular movie going audiences aside from the people who have interest in it. But in the year 2008 super-hero movies not only got bigger but also better. It was with the release of the much acclaimed Batman movie The Dark Knight which broke many box office records as well as earning two Academy Awards. So in knowing why its such a phenomenal film The Dark Knight succeeds from its great ensemble cast and screenplay. Without a doubt The Dark Knight is largely a great movie due to its cast. Just take a look at who all is in it. In his second turn as Batman Oscar-winner Christian Bale leads the cast while supporting roles come from other acting giants Michael Caine Morgan Freeman and Gary Oldman. Although theres one role in particular that has become iconic in cinema Heath Ledgers posthumous Oscar-winning role as The Joker. For certain everyones good but Heath Ledgers performance is the most memorable. With the creepy facial tics sadistic sounding voice and devilish laughing it gets under your skin. In fact I remember watching The Dark Knight in theaters on its opening day seeing him sticking a knife in the mouth of a mob boss or with the scene where he sticks a pencil through someones eye socket I was on the edge of my seat. The Joker that we see in The Dark Knight is probably the best movie-villain since Hannibal Lecter. Even though The Dark Knight has a great movie villain Christian Bale also delivers the goods as Batman. By now everyone knows the Batman growl he does in the movie which has been referenced plenty of times in pop culture but one of the big reasons it works is the intimidation factor he brings. The voice sounds animal-like and combined with the imposing all-black costume youre able to buy that criminals would be afraid of him. Bale also does the alter-ego Bruce Wayne with gravitas often sharing funny one-liners with Morgan Freeman and Michael Caine whore also of course great. Also with scenes such as the one where hes mourning over the loss of Rachel Dawes were able to see a well-rounded performance coming out of him with action humor and drama. And of the actors who also were perfect in the movie are that of Gary Oldman as Commissioner Gordon and Aaron Eckhart as Harvey Dent/Two-Face. First off to any of you that have seen Batman Begins we can see how Gordon has changed since that movie being a more tense and serious person than before and I cant help but feel as if Oldman evokes Al Pacinos performance in Heat another great movie but also there are the more sincere scenes he has. One in particular that usually gets to me is the one where he returns to his family who thought he was dead we really feel for the character as in the fact that he has to be constantly be surrounded by danger in his job but hes really doing it because hes a genuinely good person who want to protect and serve and Oldman blends so well into it that he really becomes the character. Then we have Aaron Eckhart playing Harvey Dent/Two-Face who almost in the end is the main protagonist in the movie as well as its tragic hero. As I read from the book The Art and Making Of The Dark Knight Trilogy Chris Nolan described heroes as characters that go through a major change and this is very essential to the origin of Two-Face and almost seamlessly Eckhart really makes the character transformation buy-able. Giving more strength to the already great movie is its screenplay penned by director Christopher Nolan and Brother Jonathon. Since The Dark Knight is based off of the seventy-four year old comic book series Batman theres a large canvas of source material to pull from. But rather than doing a straight on adaptation the Nolan brothers add themes that parallel todays world as well as themes about moral choice. Notably the theme of how society reacts to terrorist threats is smartly woven into the chaos The Joker brings into Gotham. As you see images of large buildings blowing up or Batman standing with firefighters at a destroyed site its hard not to think about 9/11. How this affects the rest of the characters can be summed up with the word fear. We were afraid of the horrific event 9/11 and responded aggressively by declaring war on Iraq similar to how Batman Jim Gordon and district attorney Harvey Dent had an aggressive response to both the mob and The Joker in trying to eradicate all crime in Gotham. Upon the terrorist themes in the movie the theme of moral choice is used to further show how these characters react to The Joker. Depicted in a scene where The Joker has two ferries rigged with explosives he gives the passengers on both boats triggers to blow each other up and whoever used the trigger first would be the boat of the people who survive which as youd think puts these people at this near impossible choice of whether to save their own skins or let the other passengers live. If a scene such as that actually were to occur itd be fascinating to know how wed react to that but for a film based off of a comic book to do this is stunning. The Dark Knight is a movie that ascends preconceived notions of what a comic-book movie should be and holds its place in cinema as an astonishing achievement. Aside from the Oscars and praise it has gotten the film was able to take a childhood favorite character of everyone and present him in a mature context. Altogether The Dark Knight is a phenomenally well-made film thats more than just entertaining.positive,Following several interlocked tales of criminals Pulp Fiction is about as well-written well-acted and well-directed as any film out there The first storyline centers around Jules and Vincent Samuel L Jackson John Travolta who are sent to retrieve a briefcase for their boss Marsellus Wallace Ving Rhames The second story line focuses on Vincent taking Wallaces wife Mia Uma Thurman to dinner and the final storyline is about Wallace bribing a boxer named Butch Bruce Willis to take the fall is a boxing match Of course the story is extremely complicated and is not in chronological order but going through everything that happens would take a while Tarantino won a Best Screenplay Oscar but the movie should have won many more awards including Best Picture Best Director Best Supporting Actor Samuel L Jackson and Best Supporting Actress Uma Thurman In most years I would say that John Travolta should have won the Best Actor Oscar but I give the nod to Tom Hanks in Forrest Gump The acting nonetheless is still as good as you will find anywhere Travolta Jackson Thurman Willis Rhames Christopher Walken Tim Roth Amanda Plummer Harvy Keitel and Eric Stoltz are all terrific The only sub par performance is that of Tarantino himself The style of direction that Tarantino uses is one of those love it or hate it kinds If you love few different camera shots and long focuses on a character then you will like Tarantinos style of direction In conclusion Pulp Fiction is the best movie made in the 90s I was skeptical of the film at first with its long running time but after sitting through it there really is nothing in the film that is not necessary and that should be edited out This is a film that once you see you will want to watch over and over again That is the true sign of a masterpiecepositive,Following Batman Begins Director Christopher Nolan continues the story of Batman and Gotham Citys war on crime in the 2008 The Dark Knight. Batman/Bruce Wayne Christian Bale along with Lieutenant Gordon Gary Oldman and new District Attorney Harvey Dent Aaron Eckhart are eager to destroy Gothams organized crime gangland. Their attempts are quickly halted however when they cross the mastermind and commander of the criminal world The Joker Heath Ledger. After being outwitted by The Joker anarchy hits Gotham Batman full force. As if there were not enough chaos in Bruce Waynes life there was also the motif of the love triangle between Batman Harvey Dent and Rachel Maggie Gylienhaal Bruce Waynes long time love and childhood friend. While Bruce Wayne continues being Batman and fighting crime there is no future for Rachel and himself. While waiting for Bruce to come back to her she finds herself falling in love with Harvey Dent who can provide her with the future that she desires. The love triangle between the three characters adds to the plot of the movie. Another technique relevant to the theme of the movie is the use of the camera. During a few scenes with The Joker the camera is used remarkably to intimidate viewers. In a particular scene where The Joker is threatening Rachels life by holding a knife to her head the camera focuses on them by blurring the other characters in the background. The result of this technique encouraged viewers to feel the same feeling of fear that Rachel felt in that moment. Throughout the movie the camera also shoots scenes that add to Batmans character of being fearless and gallant. For example there is a shot of the tall building and the long drop that Rachel is about to face. When she drops out of the window Batman swoops out after her. The camera shot reflects how courageous Batman is by showing the audience the risk he took. Although maybe not quite as memorable as The Dark Knight Batman Begins continued the theme of good VS evil. The 2005 film was necessary in order to lead into The Dark Knight. And at the end of The Dark Knight Nolan left viewers with questions to be answered and the need for a sequel. My personal review notes the many unexpected twists and surprises that keep viewers on the edge of their seatsŠ—_.the scenes are vivid and picturesqueŠ—_.and the shots are impressive and breathtaking from the beginning till the end. Truly a movie made for high definition and for the big screen.  friendship despair hope redemption and happiness. The musical  is nothing short of fantastic and really elevates some of the more moving scenes in the film. Firstly this film is about hope. Andy is wrongly accused of murder and is sent to Shawshank prison. He has no friends and is quickly picked on at arrival because of his quiet unassuming nature. But as time passes the other inmates begin to respect Andy because he doesnt allow prison to break him. Andy perseverance is so strong that it begins to rub off on the others. I think to really get this film you need to step away from the context of it just being a prison movie. You could say the prison is life. The warden and the guards are problems trials and troubles in life that can test and possible break you.No matter how bad things yet no matter what brutal things you have to endure youve gotta hold out hope you gotta hang on you have to believe youre gonna get through it. This is about the very nature of the human spirit told in a very simple straight forward way. This film is also about the power of friendship. I think Hollywood seems to have a hard time portraying a meaningful male friendship and just resorts to endless buddy and stoner movies. Shawshank does a great job of this. I felt this aspect of the film was told in 2 parallel stories. The first was the old librarian Brooks. When he was released he struggled to adapt to the new world. As Red says he had become institutionalized so much so that without Shawshank he felt alone afraid and had no purpose. In the end it was just too much for him to bear. Easily one of the more heartbreaking scenes in the film gets me every time. When Red is released he faces the exact same challenges that Brooks did. And he too struggled and almost lost hope. The only thing that kept him him going was his friendship with Andy. As Freeman narrates: Theres a harsh truth to face. No way Im gonna make it on the outside. All I do anymore is think of ways to break my parole so maybe theyd send me back. Terrible thing to live in fear. Brooks Hatlen knew it. Knew it all too well. All I want is to be back where things make sense. Where I wont have to be afraid all the time. Only one thing stops me. A promise I made to Andy. It was literally the only thing he felt worth living for and a key part of the film I think people forget. And before Andy left prison you could see how it deeply affected Red. He had lost his friend and the heartbreak of it was written all over Freemans face fantastic acting if you ask me  it was subtle quiet suffering. And finally the film is about Redemption. Some people feel the redemption is Andys. But I believe that Andy was just the agent of Reds redemption. At the start of the film Red was pretty much redesigned to life in prison. He had accepted that these were just the cards he was dealt and there was no real reason to feel otherwise  he had given up hope. The first few times he went for his parole hearing Red was just going through the motions he was just saying what he thought he had to get to be let out. It was completely insincere. You can see an the film progresses Andy changing Red. Theres a great scene where Red mentions that he used to play the harmonica. Andy gets him one as a present and later in a small but important scene Red picks up the Harmonica and he quietly plays a note. For me this is where Red begins to believe again. But the key scene for me is the last parole hearing. Red has been so affected by Andy that for the first time he has a genuine moment of repentance where he honestly admits to his crime: Theres not a day goes by I dont feel regret. Not because Im in here or because you think I should. I look back on the way I was then: a young stupid kid who committed that terrible crime. I want to talk to him. I want to try and talk some sense to him tell him the way things are. But I cant. That kids long gone and this old man is all thats left. I got to live with that. Rehabilitated Its just a bullshit word. So you go on and stamp your form sonny and stop wasting my time. Because to tell you the truth I dont give a bleep. It really is just an incredible moving scene one of my all time favorites. Red is completely broken and regretful its nothing short of movie magic. And the ending Well lets just say it leaves me with a smile on my face. In my opinion this is the greatest film ever made. An incredibly powerful uplifting story.

I simply cannot put into words the sheer awesome epic-ness of this third instalment The Lord of the Rings film trilogy is one of the greatest achievements in filmmaking... Peter Jackson & co did an excellent job and should be immensely proud of themselves. Stunning visuals a perfect  great acting memorable scenes and more. The film does deviate from the book a bit. Why Shelob couldnt have done what she did in TTT is beyond me. It could have shortened the running time a bit. Ah yes the running time...My one gripe is the running time & multiple endings as others have pointed out. Its a very long movie but i enjoyed every single second of it and i think it could not have been done better. Simply epic 10.1/10positive,First thought.....Excellent work by Christopher Nolan and Heath Ledgerfeels bad to miss a great actor....This movie might be considered by masterpiece by manyincluding me and some people just give 1 rating because they dont accept it as the masterpiece....Its OK but giving 1 rating is too harsh.... This is a kind of movie of movie that has something for every fans..Its really a great thing to combine actionmessages to peopleentertainment and giving it in a fast paced way..There are lot of thoughts in each character Batman - Wants to save his city Bruce Wayne - Using his resources to save the city Jokerthe best - Wants to prove the ugliness deep inside every human Harvey Dent - Even the beast can go wrong Gordon - A uncorrupted cop and a lot of good characters....If u r a casual watcher u will enjoy the movie...If u watch it deeply and closelyyou will feel the greatness in the movie...I watched the movie around 3 times....and every time i find something more interesting and deeper thought......Hatz Off Nolan....No matter Wat other users have to say....Ill go with the the critics...Its my favorite movie of my life time....positive,First things first I am a huge LOTR fan and a love all of them even The Hobbit films. I have read all the books and they are one of my favorites as the Hobbit is my favorite book of all time. LOTR in general are my favorite movie franchise of all time. They all are so well written and directed but the best of them all in the Lord of the Rings films as I liked The Desolation of Smaug more by a hair is Return of the King. Return of the King had the best battle scenes and the best cinematography and acting in it although they were all well acted. Return of the King to me had the best visual effects and the best bad ass parts. When Eowyn and Merry take down the Witch King of Angmar that was one of the best scenes in a movie ever. All in all I cant fathom the love and compassion that I have for this film if I could give it a 12 I would but alas I cant. RETURN OF THE KING IS AMAZING. YOU HAVE TO WATCH ALL OF THEM ESPECIALLY RETURN OF THE KING.positive,First thing to review about the movie is the depth of acting by Heath Ledger as Joker. The induction of terror and fear along with outstanding sound effects with Hans Zimmers ground breaking s. Strong dialogues and well crafted dynamic direction of the movie creates an immense feel to the movie. Batman costumes is having deeper feels and style. Christian Bale performs his class performance. The Nolans representation of joker is not like the original animated series joker but far better scary and have a strong attitude. Perfect villain for a perfect guardian. Many scenes have a direct implication about overcoming the fear from within. Which is truly motivating. Use of many motivating quotes boost the value of the movie. We can get the feel of the strength and responsibilities of Batman. Strong emotional sense and decision making is well depicted towards the end of the movie. How the choices have different outcomes and what a Hero means. Sacrifice and fall of a super hero. A must watch in my opinion if u like action comics superheros etc. Thank you.positive,First off why Batman Begins is better than the Dark Knight. First reason is because of the Gotham/Batman feel to movie. Christopher Nolan definitely worked hard on a Gotham city in Batman Begins with Artdeco buildings but in the Dark Knight it is Chicago and Hong Kong with all modern buildings. I recently went to Chicago and found at least a dozen places that were clearly in the Dark Knight. Also the Bat cave is lost and so is Wayne manor and I know they are both destroyed but at least in the third film they should bring those back. Second reason is because there is a more variety of villains in BB and you feel like he is almost cleansing the city which he also does not yet succeed. You expect that in the Dark Knight but you get a lighter feeling rather than a dark cruel city that needs saving. Filming mostly in the daytime really affected the film. Also the only villain you get is the Joker i guess Two-Face but you do not get them at once and he is just one person trying to make the city his. The villain is to clear you do not get a dark and confused world. In BB you have Scarecrow Victor Zsaz Ras Al Ghul Carmine Falconi and Henri Ducard. Thridly I have heard that the reason if any why they did not like the Dark Knight is that there was too much action. The action scenes were not even memorable in terms of hand to hand combat which there were few of. All the training he got seemed to go to waste against the Joker. Now about the movie. This cast is also stacked like the Dark Knight. Batman Begins is a great and entertaining movie especially for the comic reader. I first saw the movie before I read comics and played video games on Batman. Watching it again I was blown away absolutely amazed about how much detailed was put into the movie  which the Dark Knigh lacked. This was Christian Bales best movie yet. For a third movie it would be awesome if they did not let go of the Joker but instead get a Heath Ledger look alike to play various cut scenes of him escaping Arkhum Asylum and ruling Gotham. This time it would be harder for Batman to get to him because this time the Riddler and the Penguin are in his way. The Riddler is forcefully employed by the Joker and the Penguin is persuaded. The Riddler should be a Jigsaw type character spying on Batman and making him solve his riddles. The Penguin on the other hand is almost tricked by fighting Batman because he has started racketeering and business fraud which he come across Wayne Industries. The Joker is ruling all of this. Maybe a third villain would come in handy. Also bring back the Gotham look and it should be the start of the Batman we all know the Great Detective and the Dark Knight.

reality check here if you had told people some 100 years ago we had men walking on the moon and that air travel would be a very common thing these days they would have thought we were crazy so try to think beyond the current human knowledge and youll understand that there is yet so much more for us to discover to explore interstallar deals with this perfectly and gracefully in my opinion and it is very correct in physical terms too eg no sounds are audible in space  when the explosion occurs fot me at least this is an excellent movie well worth its current rating and more than worth the one oscar it got if you are an avid scifi fan especially one who enjoys the deeper mystery stuff this is one movie not to misspositive,First of all this is probably the greatest superhero movie ever made. Chris Nolan out did himself on this one. From the acting to the action this movie is perfect. Nolan does an excellent job in each of his Batman films of encapsulating the essence of the caped crusader. And if the movie didnt have enough going for it before you factor in the Joker and Ledgers performance. This is honestly one of the greatest acting jobs I have seen in a film period. Heath Ledger effortlessly becomes Mista J with his own twist. It is such a dark and convincingly terrifying portrayal of the Joker it gives any view the chills. The Dark Knight is not only an amazing movie but quite possibly may go down as a top ten film in general when its all said and done.positive,First of all things i should say i am a comic-book fan. From Eastern Europe. Why is this important Because here its something really different then in the USA. In the USA comic-books are part of the everyday life. Here it is not. Here it is an underrated genre and most of the people still think it is something sissy for small children and contains only fighting and dialogue no higher level then Kapow and Boom-Boom. And it was even worse when i was little. It was always a little treasure hunt to get some. And most of them was bad rip-off cheap junk from the above mentioned category and it was only Batman who continually represented quality and was available for a kid like me too. And i was amused and loved it. Not Batman in the first place but the amazing villains. And especially Joker. He was the best of the best. Maybe the most complex interesting and remarkable character ever created. And to tell the truth i wasnt entirely satisfied with either one of the Batman films made up to the Dark Knight. Especially considering that there was an absolutely brilliant animated series: Batman the Animated Series check it out if you like Batman well worth it. They first 3 movies were okay but the Batman and Robin and Batman Begins both sucked big time but for different reasons. I lost hope i will ever see a really good and faithful adaptation of this comic. Then along came this one. Yes it has some overdone parts some flaws here and there a bit rushed and corny ending but its good meaningful and Heath Ledger who i disliked before i saw this is the absolutely perfect Joker. When i saw the casting i thought it is a disgrace. After i saw the movie i thought he was unearthly good. The film has suspense great acting emotions and a very interesting and coherent plot which is very rare in Hollywood blockbusters. Well worth watching for anyone and everyone. Especially for people who think comic-books are sissy things for little children...positive,first of all a great thanks Peter Jackson to make people to re-live Tolkiens EPIC-Lord of the Rings trilogy. All the 3 three movies comes with a great cinematic experience an experience that rule the hearts of millions forever an experience that take you back to the middle earth. The direction of the the movie is perfect and the acting is treat to watch specially Sean Astinsam and Viggo Mortensenaragon. All technical aspects of the movie are good. The war scenes are so perfectly created that people will love to watch. Although the movie is not as good as book but it is the best that can be created out of book and also you cant expect everything in 200 mins movie.positive,Finally after a series of magical books by J.R.R. Tolkien and after the first two movies in a series that redefined cinema The Lord of the Rings series finally comes to a close with The Return of the King. Im so pleased to be saying the following words. This movie is not just the best in this magical series but its also mostly one of the greatest movies ever made on screen. The final story picks up where The Two Towers left off where Frodo and Sam are still traveling to Mordor while Gollum might set them in a trap to capture the ring at last. Then Gandalf and the gang are still trying to defeat the wrath of Sauron and finally be able to destroy this deadly ring. Thanks to the incredible masterful directing by Peter Jackson and thousands of artists and technicians they all help us dig deeper into this magical world that only at the movies we can be able to escape to. The performances are just brilliant and electrifying to watch on screen. Elijah Wood and Sean Astin are just brilliant continuing their roles as Frodo and Sam and they still have a lot of heart and soul into their on-screen friendship. Ian McKellen and Viggo Mortensen improves once again with fine and brilliant performances. But out of all that its Andy Serkis that should have received a Best Supporting Actor nomination in 2003 for his work as Gollum. Serkis has portrayed such a brilliant character and the visual enhancements made to create him was all quite super. From an opening flashback involving Smeagol a.k.a. Gollum thats super thrilling to a final setback Gollum is by far the best character in this movie. Although this movie is set during a long 200 minute run-time I was just distracted for what this movie had to offer that I didnt care about how long it was. It has everything youd expect to see. Its got heartbreak action comedy drama fantasy and magic. The special effects are exhilarating from beginning to end and it made me wanting for more. The beautiful art direction and costumes made me feel like I escaped to a more beautiful place. The cinematography is challenging in such perfection and the original  is really with a treat. I also adored the wonderful sound effects and the memorable film editing. The love stories are touching the friendship scenes are heartwarming the fight scenes are groundbreaking and the finale blends with a perfect mix of heartbreak and hope. I could tell you a thousand reasons why this movie is excellent. This is a movie that loves movies. Its a movie that keeps you wanting for more. All this movie needed was a talented director a brilliant cast groundbreaking special effects incredible art direction amazing music and an inspirational storyline. This is such a crowning achievement in cinema. Its one of my all-time favorite movies and Im glad this movie won the Best Picture Oscar in 2003. LOTR: The Return of the King in my review an epic and groundbreaking cinematic masterpiece.positive,Film director Nolan really is crossed with this  I work One teacher nail Batman saga That hardly could be overcome.

I say goodbye and thanking the Work Done That the great cast Create esta could work together .positive,Fear can hold you prisoner. Hope can set you free Š—– These words inscribed on the poster of The Shawshank Redemption sum up whats at stake in Frank Darabonts chef-doeuvre. The Shawshank Redemption shows us that there is hope even within the restricted walls of a prison. Andy Dufresne Tim Robbinsis a prominent banker wrongly convicted of killing his wife and her paramour who spends many years in the Shawshank prison. He forges an unforgettable friendship with Red Morgan Freeman a veteran of the penal system who helps him to cope with the frightening realities of prison life. While the prison walls shield Red and the other prisoners from the depredations of an ever-changing world it has the exact opposite effect on Dufresne who exploits every possible opportunity to bring a taste of the outside world to himself and his fellow convicts. Their bond forms the backbone of the film. Tim Robbins is right at the top of his game as he paints a fascinating portrait of an unjustly incarcerated inmate and brings an innate humanity to Stephen Kings principal character. Freeman is exceptional as Red and his narrative much of which is taken verbatim from Kings story holds the story together and like a skilled conductor waves a baton to orchestrate our emotions. Frank Darabont uses his powers as a supreme storyteller and an astonishing craftsman to breathe life into a genre that I thought had been dead since The Great Escape. He leaves us a poignant film with a powerful message of hope and redemption masterfully told. The films greatest triumph is its earnestness that makes even those moments that might have felt slushy achieve the dignity of genuine tragedy. It is deeper than most filmspositive,fashions fade style is eternal  yves laurent filled with superslick visuals and impeccable compositions this bigbudget thriller looks better with each passing

alive. They have stories and dialogue to be sure but you dont get the feeling that anybody is actually thinking or feeling. Pulp Fiction is the antidote to those films. It is one of the most unique films ever made and it is brimming with fascinating dialogue with original humor with energy and with life. Writer/director Quentin Tarantino has made a masterpiece of dialogue tone and setting. Like the characters we have to be on our toes to appreciate the richness of the story. Time lines and story lines intersect with sex drugs violence and humor in ways that we dont fully understand until long past the credits role. This film also stays with us long after the credits role appreciating its audacity intelligence and Tarantinos boundless energy.positive,Fabulous one of my favorites. One cant but expect great things from the final film in The Lord of the Rings trilogy. But that isnt really fair because its very hard to top what is already very good and highly rated. With this in mind I expected the third film to be about the same as the rest with some people being let down because they had unrealistic expectations. And so it is - its more climactic more emotional and more bold but not necessarily better. The special effects are strained by the demands of the story more so in Return of the King. Dont expect miracles and you will appreciate the film for what it is. Even more has been changed from the book than the first two films but of course the key elements are all there. As a fan I almost wished I didnt know the story because I was looking for too many elements rather than letting the film flow. But the second viewing cured me of this. Bring on the extended version.positive,eying that this film starts where Two Towers left off is somewhat misleading for the film starts a great distance from the walls of Helms Deep. Return of the King opens with a flashback of Smeagol Andy Serkis obtaining the one ring of power and an origin of his deterioration into the creature Gollum. This opening recaptures an emphasis that was somewhat lost within the epic battles of Two Towers at thats the ring. The first installment The Fellowship of the Ring provided heaps of exposition on the rings importance and influence and in Return of the King we see it pay off big time. After the armies of Isengard have been defeated due to an allegiance between Theoden Bernard Hill the king of Rohan and the elves the main threat to middle earth is now concentrated in the kingdom of Mordor controlled by the dark lord Sauron. Sauron has turned his eye towards the realm of Gondor the last free kingdom of men and the wizard Gandalf Ian McKellan must warn Denethor John Noble Steward of Gondor of the impending attack while Aragorn Viggo Mortenson heir to the throne of Gondor and Theoden gather men to aid against the armies of Mordor. The dark lord Sauron needs only to regain the one ring of power to conquer all of middle earth and two hobbits Frodo Elijah Wood the ring-bearer and Sam Sean Astin must continue their journey directed by Gollum to Mount Doom the only place where the ring can be destroyed. Got all that If not you need tone up on your Lord of the Rings before expecting to follow this film. I want see this movie again and again  theres a lot of emotion on display and its frequently overwhelming. Jackson gives the audience what it wants and gives himself the pleasure of having created a work of art that is deeply personal as well embodying as it does notions of chivalry and honor that go all the way back to `Heavenly Creatures. In order to bring the massive story to closure Jackson is forced to concentrate more on plot and battle the films centerpiece the oversized battle at Pelennor Fields is enthralling with plenty of swaggering action drawn from the Warner Bros. swashbucklers of the thirties and have his cast shoulder the responsibility of maintaining interest in the characters--but fortunately everyone is up to the challenge with Sean Astin as Sam for whom the story is ultimately about and Elijah Wood as Frodo sensitively handling the supporting role to which he has been relegated being the moral centers. Jackson and production designer Grant Major for the finale have combined the best design schemes of the previous two films the warm colorful textures of the `The Fellowship Of The Ring with the rocky monochromatic landscapes of `The Two Towers and the result is a breathtaking moving cinematic experience that delivers the trilogy into movie legend  the fact that its now over means that audiences will feel an acute loss at Christmastime from hereon in.positive,Everything from themes to dialog to underlying storyline is a modern-day classic One can watch this movie 10 times and come away with some new perspectives each and every time Even the music is totally engrossing SEE THIS MOVIE A one time viewing is not enough Its like an onion Each viewing peels another level And each new level reveals insights you didnt notice before The film strikes deep emotions and introspective tones without being overly intellectual You never feel like your sitting in a literature class but nonetheless you find yourself diving deep into the characters Most remarkably it does all of this Deep Thinking while keeping a wonderful sense of humor Its a real trick to be exploring these engaging powerful and even violent characters and yet keep you laughing too Bottom line its like a 10 course meal with all different flavored levels that still manages to keep the watcher wanting more A modern

But certainly as entertaining a film that it is being a personal favorite does not necessarily make it a great film or dare I sayŠ—”the greatest film ever made. But what then makes a film great First and foremost if it sets out to entertain the general public it must do that and Shawshank certainly does that. Its pure entertainment value is essentially a stipulation in its inclusion in the great IMDb greatest movie debate. The serious nature of its central plot pointsŠ—”a wrongly convicted murderer who assists the corrupt warden as means to affect his own escapeŠ—”is contrasted by some truly funny scenes. Although by no means a comedy the splendid screenplay is wrought with witty dialog. Theres nothing fancy about this filmŠ—”no special effects spectacular scenery or even a bunch of pretty women. No its just the telling of a story mostly through the narration of Morgan Freemans character Red that almost lulls viewers into believing that nothing really interesting or important is going to happen here. But after all of the subtle plot twists I think what makes this film great for me is I feel like Im actually sharing in Andys redemption. Now if that isnt what they teach in Film-making 101 then they should just close up the classroom. Ultimately there cannot be a single motion picture that is the greatest film of all time because as art and in an art form as varied as cinema greatness must be measured by each individual. Greatness as beauty truly is in the eye of the beholder. But in this beholders eyes I think The Shawshank Redemption is truly the greatest film I have ever seen.positive,every so often there is a movie with full originality great acting great filming and wide twists in the plot actually this isnt fully original since it is about a disappearance but the subplots and curveballs thrown are good enough it follows a seemingly happy couples affleck& pike journey after the wife goes missing throughout the movie secrets will be revealed and the unexpected will ensue as we find out what really happened to the wife and how the marriage already was the themes of dishonestly media and perceiving are what make this movie important to see if there wasnt important themes there would not be importance and the movie itself would not have been as good this movie is a firstrate thrill ride that has not been done amazingly since inception back in 2010 inception was an actionthriller whereas gone girl is a mysterythriller and i honestly cant remember the last mysterythriller that was this good alfred hitchcock would have been impressedpositive,Every once in a while you come across a movie which touches your heart in a way you cannot describe. It moves you and affects your take on life. This is one such movie. It will fill you with an undefinable happiness and youll never be able to get enough of it. The Acting: Splendid acting by Tim Robbins. He carries the role of an educated lawyer partial to music with enviable charm and subtlety. Morgan Freeman of course is as good as ever. His narrations are always a cherry on the cake. The Soundtrack: An elegantly restrained balance between the grim tones of the Shawshank Prison and the more melodic influences of hope. Perfectly in conjunction with the acting. I hope anyone who hasnt seen this movie sees it. I Hope...positive,Every minute of the film is epic the visuals the dialog and the . The film alone is a masterpiece in the way the story is brought to its climax the music brings it to another level of emotion. The first two films build the momentum for a huge finale the battle of helms deep was incredible but the real battle is yet to come. We see man and beast collide over numerous battles whilst we see Frodo and Sam struggle on their quest meanwhile the other members of the fellowship face their own obstacles and ultimately fight to survive. The ending really creates a roller coaster of emotions regarding particular characters some of their lives are in jeopardy. I must conclude that this has been my number 1 since its release and I doubt I shall see another film as good. Greatest Film to end the greatest trilogy.positive,Every mind has billions of ideas and each one of us do things that no one expects us to do some of those things are visible some notŠ—_ but one of those things that make our life worth living is FREEDOM Tim Robbins stars as Andy Dufresne a young man who faces a long long time in prison after he is wrongfully found guilty of murdering his wife and her lover. While inside he learns an awful lot about what a man can hold onto and let himself be put through if there is still an ounce of hope in his soul. Bottles of cool drink on a hot rooftop a slowly building library collection the moment of musical joy that sees Dufresne severely punished for his overstepping of the mark and many other scenes spring to mind as classic moments in a movie almost chock full of classic moments. Andy quickly gets befriended by Red Morgan Freeman actually the narrator of the story both soon prove that even in the worst circumstances within the hell on earth they can maintain human dignity and strive on their own way to freedom... Morgan Freeman is the films secret strength playing the guy who can get it for you with a note of welcome ambiguity. Watching him in an early scene when a fat new convict fresh fish is being beaten by cruel head guard Captain Hadley Clancy Brown you dont know whether Red looks so crestfallen for the victim or for the packs of cigarettes he just lost betting the guy wouldnt break before Dufresne James Whitmore was equally memorable as a prisoner who was unable to adjust to the outside after his parole following a 50 year stint. This shows that people who have been incarcerated for such a long period need some sort of readjustment training before they rejoin society. For Whitmore freedom meant ultimate doom making the scene one of my all-time favorite displaying the ultimate dark side and a certain fear in freedom. Tim Robbins Morgan Freeman along with James Whitmore etched unforgettable performances as prisoners charged with crime. The film shows what prison life is all about. Subjects dealing with prison survival brutality corruption and ultimate redemption are well shown. An outstanding film dealing with prisons as seen by several prisoners. Many social problems are discussed here. The picture earned a well-deserved best picture Oscar nomination. It certainly should have tied with the winner the equally good Forrest Gump. My Rating - 10/10positive,every generation of movie goers sees one film maybe two that changes the game for them it becomes a signature moment that they remember years to come they remember where they saw it who they saw it with even where they were sitting christopher nolan has proved to be a film maker who works best with a big canvas and he has never been given a canvas bigger than the one he used for his latest film interstellar i feel i cant even call going to see a nolan piece a movie but more like an event for the average movie goer they most likely arent familiar with the directors of the films theyre seeing but most know nolan most know of nolan because he has made some of the biggest thrilling and thought provoking films of the past decade from the dark knight trilogy to inception its almost not worth trying to do a plot synopsis of interstellar because it is difficult to try to condense the happenings in a film this huge because i know that i will leave out something big anyway the film takes place in a potentially nottoodistant future where the earth has become unable to produce all but a few crops and it will get to a point where none will be able to grow and man will die out in comes an engineerpilotfather cooper matthew mcconaughey who is entrusted to be part of a space expedition to venture beyond a newly discovered wormhole to try and find a new planet capable of inhabiting the human race astronauts from previous missions have supposedly landed and have been sending signals for them to come mcconaughey has always had that movie star potential and i think this is the film that puts him in that title this was a truly star making role due to the size of the film and i honestly believe he is the only man who could have done it interstellar was originally supposed to be done by steven spielberg before he dropped out and nolan stepped in nolan clearly influenced by past spielberg films like close encounters of the third kind and jaws puts mcconaughey in a role in the same vein as richard dreyfuss in close encounters or roy schneider in jaws they needed an actor who could be looked at as an everyday guy who is experiencing incredible circumstances and mcconaughey is able to display the emotion required for a man who has to drop everything including his family whom he knows he may not see again and try to save the human race you can see it in his eyes and hear it in his voice and your heart breaks and lifts with his simultaneously this isnt necessarily a role that wins oscars but it should be the effects are obviously amazing this much like gravity last year is a film that needs to be seen on the big screen especially in imax this along with the haunting  of frequent nolan collaborator hans zimmer almost transports you to that necessary place that makes the events happening on screen seem possible kind of piggy backing off of that point there will be those who will trash the film for the science isnt accurate those comments are nonsense because no matter what science tells us there is just no way for us to actually comprehend what is beyond a wormhole or what would happen if we attempted to go through one could we really transcend time and space? would we discover new worlds and new civilizations? impossible for us to say at this point but what makes this film so great is that we are able to see the ideas of what can be its the mystery of the unknown that both frightens and enthralls man and few films have been able to capture those feelings like interstellar in a time where there are no more explorers were fortunate to be put in a position where we can feel what is like to discover and explore new worlds people will remember interstellar for either being a truly great film experience or not as good as 2001 a space odyssey this is one of most popular slights against the film so far as it is the closest thing to 2001 and defenders of the kubrick classic will argue to the death that it doesnt live up to it this is an argument that no one will win because it is a generational issue people see these landmark films during their youth and they leave such an impression on them that it almost becomes blasphemy to hear of another film made years later rivaling the one they saw people want to believe that the film from their time was the best and that no film will be able to capture those emotions they first felt and the memories that it created for them i respect and detest this because i will most likely feel the same way when future space adventures in the same vein as interstellar come out and i fear it is something that is out of my control much of the film circles around the idea that love is the one true thing that travels purely through time and space because it is that connection we feel with one another that makes us human and that can be applied with our love for certain films the connection we feel with our favorite films is almost unshakable and those who think they can make us waver from those feelings are exercising in futility in the end interstellar is one of those landmark films its a chance for us to escape reality and feel sense of adventure hope and amazement that rarely comes around dont miss itpositive,Ever since I was a little girl Batman has been like my role model. I absolutely love Batman When Batman Begins came out I waited for the sequel I was too excited I knew it wouldnt let me down I mean Christopher Nolan is the director and with an amazing composer like Hans Zimmer I had very high expectations for this movie. When I saw it I was blown away. The Joker portrayed by Heath Ledger was something else. Something so sinister dark unique He really captured my attention and everyone elses. My favorite scene was when he was being interrogated. His view on civilized society and just his view in general about anything really played around with your mind. Rest In Peace Heath Ledger.It is a long movie but it has the right for it to be 152 minutes. Just when you think it might be coming to an end when they capture The Joker and save Harvey BOOM plot twist because thats just another part of his plan. Then BOOM Rachel dies it really sets in an emotion one of the sparks for the final outcome of the movie. The cast was amazing amazing directorcomposeramazing everything. I have watched this movie so much TOO MUCH. Great movie it really has a major significance in my life no kid or person that love Batman will be disappointed. My favorite movie of all time and I highly suggest you watch this moviepositive,Even when this trilogy of movies directed by Peter Jackson isnt entirely faithful to the books in which it was inspired I think that it does capture the essence of the monumental epic written by Tolkien managing to be solemn and magnificent but keeping all the exciting fun from the original story. All the elements that made the original book a timeless work in the history of literature are present in three movies from the epic background to the most subtle subtext elements a quality that makes this trilogy of movies being something more complex and significant than any other fantasy movie that I had seen before in my life. The production values are superb being able to recreate all the grandeur of the Middle Earth. Every single scene from this movie has an incredibly level of beauty without comparison having all of them the perfect mood and atmosphere for each part of the history. All the scenes are wonderfully directed showing a great love for the original story and the characters from it: The music the performances the visual effectsŠ—_Every single elements fits perfectly creating in that way an outstanding cinematic experience that possess the timeless greatness and magnificence from the original books. While The Fellowship of the Ring serves as an excellent introduction to this fantasy world and the main characters of this story The Two Towers works incredibly well as an inner exploration of the personalities of the characters as they struggle against their personal conflicts. Finally The Return of the King closes the story in a more than satisfying way with a moving resolution that is happy sad and nostalgic at the same time. Those three films will always have a very special meaning for me being not only a great trilogy which is incredibly well done and its very entertaining to watch but also a unique cinematic experience that at least in my opinion couldnt be matched. Personally I consider this trilogy the ultimate example of the genre of fantasy in the history of cinema. 10/10 I would rate the 3 films with eleven stars if I could.positive,Even though this movie is over 10 years old the message about friendship and not ever giving up will be relevant forever. The lessons that the main characters teach us in the face of adversity are timeless. This is also one movie that does not get old and I have watched Shawshank many times. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman were spectacular in their performances. They teach lessons that are extremely memorable and have quotes that you will never forget. The one quote in the film that is a stand-out is Get busy living or get busy dying. Who would not feel the impact of that quote This is one movie you have to have in your library and I am not one that usually buys DVDs. This is a MUST SEE Dont miss this one and also keep a box of tissues nearby.positive,even though im a huge fan of movies based on comics especially when its marvel i wasnt quite sure what to expect about this one yet my mind has been made up pretty fast during the first minutes of this movie the fun laughter and entertainment awesome soundtrack starts pretty much right away by minute one even though i see myself as a bit of a critic when it comes to jokes in action movies  had a blast during the whole 121 minutes  including the credits yep the characters are lovely the music as said fits just perfect and the action isnt missing either if youre looking for a good time  guardians of the galaxy brings it positive,Even after the second installments grand success I was still afraid that it will fail. The trailer was brilliant and promised a thousands things to come. And then in the next 3 and a half hours I was proved wrong This was the best conclusion to a great trilogy. I never imagined that they could make it bigger and better than the last two. The previous movies were just picnic. Not only the action sequences but also the emotions run high. The battle scenes were really great. But I was more concerned about the people we knew from the last two films who were in it. You really get that feeling of The Return. Unlike the first two this movie is stylish. The elements are more elegant the story more bold the  more experienced and bold and the dangers more troublesome. As Frodo and Sam march towards Mount Doom the movie gets more darker and hope really seems to fade away. One thing I learned in this movie is: Never give up. No matter what happens you have to finish the task because your cause is important. For me and all the LOTR fans this is not a movie. What we thought of as an action movie-of-the-week turned out to be an important lesson on hope friendship conquering your fears and love. Its a cinematic achievement that will never be defeated. This really is the king of all movies and the 11 golden statues prove it. Go for it Only if you have seen the first two movies 10/10positive,Essential viewing This film is an absolute heavyweight I must have seen it dozens of times by now and it doesnt really ever stop being entertaining A lot of the most well made movies dont really allow themselves to be fun They try to be more of a statement and I love that it brings me an immense joy to watch a classically structured no-nonsense beautifully artful film But Pulp Fiction is just so much fun that it managed to infiltrate the ranks of the elite and when it got there it decided to throw a party Whats not to love about Pulp Fiction Every aspect is built like a roller coaster  the film is just a big crazy amusement park Most important to me though and Im sure many others would have to be the storys structure Have you ever seen a chronological timeline of the film Its crazy Its like when the film is in the correct order it doesnt make sense anymore It wouldnt fit the film because its too much fun for an A to B The way Quentin Tarantino weaved the films content together is so extremely impressive because it works so well The film just flows The transitions are so fluid And the story itself is just so interesting that the way it shifts around itself creates so much intrigue and makes it so thrilling Just as integral as the way the story is presented is the characters that present it Vincent Jules and Butch are really just normal people in the world of Pulp Fiction but to the viewer theyre so much larger than life Not only do Vincent and Jules have an unforgettable chemistry as partners but what was really incredible to me was the chemistry Vincent and Butch had as enemies without even really knowing each other The conflict between them created by just two encounters is astounding Jules though Jules is excellent A great character played by a great actor Samuel L Jackson steals every single scene hes in His monologues are legendary This man must have needed some great vengeance AND furious anger to be able to deliver those lines the way he did He was one bad mother I remember seeing parts of the film as a kid and wondering what the rest of it would be like I thought seeing the whole movie would be like opening pandoras box on my concept of what a movie could be Looking back I think I was right positive,Epic Batman gets the film we have all waited for masterpiece. I must say many comic book movies have neither the depth or interest to get you involved in the film this had everything. The cast are the strongest of any film of DC/Warner to date and Ledger is mesmerising as the chaotic joker. I first saw this on opening night in Leeds the cinema was packed and people were sitting on the floor it was that full The film stands head and shoulders amongst the other two Nolan batman films and for good reason. The reason this is such a strong film is the direction Nolan knows how to weave the correct story and place the right actors into their affiliated roles. Bale is great as the brooding batman and Ledger is a worthy opponent mentally. Gary Oldman is great as commissioner Gordon and the acting is out of this world good from all involved. You can see why they chose Ledger as he has brought a whole new joker to the world. The story concentrates some time after the events of Batman Begins and Batman has been successfully cleaning the streets of Gotham with great effect.

This truly is my favorite movie of all-time because no matter how many times I see it I still get the genuine feeling of hope the film has delivered since the first time I saw it. Everything about this movie is perfect  the story is always first What is impressive is how for an original story with such scope of themes and ideas to be explored not much is really missed in the film and it is so expertly adapted one cannot fail to overlook any of the flaws purists might make a point of and be simply overwhelmed by its power positive,EDITED In 1946 a banker named Andy Dufresne Tim Robbins is convicted of a double murder even though he stubbornly proclaims his innocence. Hes sentenced to a life term at the Shawshank State Prison in Maine where another lifer Ellis Red Redding Morgan Freeman picks him as the new recruit most likely to crack under the pressure. The ugly realities of prison life are quickly introduced to Andy: a corrupt warden Bob Gunton sadistic guards led by Capt. Byron Hadley Clancy Brown and inmates who are little better than animals willing to use rape or beatings to insure their dominance. But Andy does not crack: he has the hope of the truly innocent which together with his smarts allow him to prevail behind bars. He uses his banking skills to win favor with the warden and the guards doing the books for Nortons illegal business schemes and keeping an eye on the investments of most of the prison staff. In exchange he is able to improve the prison library and bring some dignity and respect back to many of the inmates including Red. Based on a story by Stephen King The Shawshank Redemption was the directorial debut of screenwriter Frank Darabont. what a spectacular movie it is. i remember seeing this movie when i was a child but couldnt remember much of it so i decided to watch this movie now once again. people are not crazy when they think it is one of the best movies of all time. almost half of the world population might have seen it maybe the second most loved movie after The Godfather. one of my very most favorite movies of all time one of the best movies ever made a highlight of 1994. this truly is an Masterpiece a pure work of genius. a near perfect classic movie. a movie that will never get old a memorable movie. will always be remembered. it was nominated for 7 Oscars unfortunately didnt won any Best Picture Adapted Screenplay Cinematography Editing Sound Original  and Actor in a Lead Role Morgan Freeman. Best Picture that year went to Forrest Gump. story of this movie just so wonderful with so much to say in layers. it is story of Tim Robbins as Andy who is been falsely accused of murder is being jailed in Shawshank there he meet Morgan Freeman as Red he and other cellmates becomes friend. Andy is a weird and unique inmate there which when i found what he did or was doing just shocked me he is jaw dropingly genius. he becomes a personal banker to a corrupt and very cruel warden sameul played by Bob Gunton and his other men. he secretly works on his own legal case while he is educating and trying to improve lives of his other cell mates he makes them read and study since he himself is an educated man. he escapes from jail too in the end which is an epic scene to me. this movie stars Tim Robbins Morgan Freeman Bob Gunton Bill Sadler Clancy Brown  James Whitmore  Gil Bellows  Mark Rolston  Jeffrey DeMunn  Dion Anderson  Ned Bellamy  Bill Bolender  Larry Brandenburg  Brian Brophy and others. Tim Robbins gave a good performance just like he did in Mystic River but this time you may see him smile too. i like his performance did justice to his character. i liked him when i saw this movie first. then there is Mr. Morgan Freeman as Red which according to me was a 100% perfect casting he was very good in his character delivered a very good performance. this movie overall features good performances. and i like both the characters of both Andy and Red memorable characters they are. and also their chemistry was so good in this movie. Directed by Frank Darabont whose only movie i remember after this one is The Green Mile and TV Series The Walking Dead. he really did a good job in this movie superb work indeed. truly impressive. screenplay of this movie is excellently written. superbly executed. you will love the way this movie grows on you completely and completely takes over. i was hooked to this movie. Editing of this movie was really good. good cinematography and art direction. just a good of everything. good  too ofciurse. this is one of the best prison movies a truly heart touching inspiring uplifting thought provoking timeless sad movie that will be loved by every person with a soul in them. a very moving movie. i loved it truly very lovable movie that i dont even need to recommend it to you. Most of you have seen it but if by any chance not THE A MUST MUST WATCH.positive,Dont know how many will ever see the 2086th comment in this site - but just saw a friends DVD of this film again. I had missed it due to being in Europe on an extended business trip when it played first-run and caught some portions of it a few years later and then completely sometime following. This was the third or fourth time Id seen it straight through and it is one of those very rare films which is as good - maybe even better - on successive viewings. Robbins Freeman Gunton and all of the remaining cast - whether in larger supporting roles or smaller - are outstanding without a single exception. My friend is a computer whiz with an IQ of probably 150 and widely-expert expert in this area. But hes so immersed in this realm that whenever forced to use pen and paper instead of mouse or keyboard he does so on about the 5th-grade level. After the film he had bought the DVD but had never seen it before he stated he didnt feel the Robbins character could have pulled-off all the shenanigans with the money from prison via mail and perhaps sometimes using a messenger of the wardens the way the film depicted -- whereas today if such an inmate had a computer terminal available it would be more possible. I told him I felt certain the opposite was true. In the era of the story a very intelligent financially-adept individual - especially a former whiz-kid bank V.P. - could have done what was shown even more effectively and successfully than via computer today with all the firewalls and in-house computer nerds any bank has. Someone with both tremendous financial and hacker ability might - but not as easily as Tim did during a period when signatures and figures on paper and the like were the governing elements. This aspect is one of the most critical and climactic for the story and its very satisfying ending. And Gunton a tremendous actor who has done many sympathetic characters presents one of the best performances portraying a truly evil person - more so for the quieter and nasty-nice elements of this portrayal. He juxtaposes quiet demeanor often even pious with completely selfish vicious amoral actions as well as humanly possible with his performance in this role This is a film for which the term perfect piece of entertainment does not exaggerate.positive,dont be fooled by my review guardians of the galaxy wont help you achieve enlightenment fall in love or lose weight especially if youre the chick who sits beside me crushing a popcorn tub singlehanded but if youre looking for a great movie this weekend you wont find anything better on the big screen guardians delivers what it promises and more that being said as is always the case with marvel studios productions some wont enjoy it guardians isnt part of the superhero genre however its science fiction none of the characters are superheroes technically thus comprises the ragtag band one human two aliens one genetically enhanced one anthropomorphic raccoon and one humanoid plant it belongs in the intergalactic genre the same barrel as star wars and star trek if that sounds displeasing you may be in the same boat as the douchey dude two seats down from me the opening scenes a tearjerker and im swept up so to speak it takes place on earth and involves nothing extraterrestrial at the emotional climax he speaks is this when the raccoon shows up?

Take heart however that there are good reasons for every entry on this list because most of the scenes were known to have been filmed as still shots have turned up in various books that have been published on the film and even the official movie site. Also apparently not long ago Jackson gave an interview to a German magazine and gave a ballpark running time for the extended edition of 4 hours and 15 minutes. This may just be a rumor but if true the EE will then be roughly 50-55 minutes longer than the theatrical release. Things most likely to be seen in the Extended Edition: 1. The wrap-up of the Saruman-Wormtongue story line. Jackson has already gone on record that this 7-minute scene will be the EE. Sarumans and Wormtongues fate will be spelled out here. 2. The confrontation between Gandalf and the Witch King. This doesnt happen at the breaking of the main gate but instead on the walls of Minas Tirith. Pippin is with Gandalf on Shadowdfax and the Witch King is riding a fell beast. 3. The Houses of Healing. Many missed the part of Eowyn and Faramirs relationship. The Houses of Healing will show Aragorns healing ability and help fill in this beautiful sub-plot that resolves Eowyns unrequited love for Aragorn. 4. The trek across Mordor. Think that Sam and Frodos journey seemed a bit compressed once they were inside Mordor The official movie book provides a two page spread of pictures and explanation of Frodo and Sam getting caught up in the orc armies and forced to march with them as they are mistaken for deserters. Its reasonable to assume that this and other scenes with flesh out the final trek quite a bit more. 5. Merrys pledge of service to King Theoden. Pictures exist of this scene but not much is known about how it is fleshed out. 6. Confrontation at the Black Gate with the Mouth of Sauron Mordors chief human lieutenant. Although no pictures of this scene have surfaced The Mouth of Sauron was credited in extended cast lists to the same guy who played the Train Master in Matrix Revolutions. 7. Eomers discovery of King Theoden and Eowyn where they fell on the battlefield. If there is indeed 50-55 additional minutes then this list is by no means exhaustive. There will probably be a lot of longer scenes like in the Two Towers EE as well as several wholly new scenes we know nothing about as yet.positive,do not go gentle into that good night old age should burn and rave at close of day that was one hell of a dialog from the movie #interstellar even though it was inspired from a poem chris nolan made a film which makes even science freaks also dont know some of em which he implied in the film it is evidently clear that he doesnt like this 3d world which instead he created 5d world and made time as a physical quantity in his world literally there is no words to explain the ingenuity of chris the way he crafted the characters and effectively using technical expertise and screen writing definitely make us to taste transcendence once again he proved that he is not a contemporary director but a director who evolved from unrealistic future matt did a splendid job by portraying cooper and express his emotions as a destitute and griefstricken father was incomparable hans zimmer he is at his best anne and jess made justice to their roles matt damon and michael caine played a pivotal role as well chris also made india as part of his film because of mom i think even though it is little about india i think overall film is astoundingly superb with intense screenplay unless you detest physics or you lack keenness but its better to study a lilbit before bon appetite remember do not go gentle into that good movie #interstellar and #inception are the best scifi masterpieces ive ever seen in this decade take a bow chris nolan and orgoglioso di es sere un fan di christopher nolanpositive,Director Quentin Tarantino gives us a cinematic master piece with the film Pulp Fiction an anthology movie that is not told in chronological order which is what I think is a great idea to keep the audience on their toes to see what happens next. The first story titled Vincent Vega And Marcellus Wallaces Wife follows Vincent Vega played by John Travolta who is told by Marcellus Wallus played by Ving Rhames to take care of his wife Mia Wallace played by Uma Thurman. They go to a 50s style restaurant titled Jack Rabbiit Slims where the famous twist contest happens. The story really escalates when Mia has a heroin overdose and has to have an adrenaline shot. Fun Fact: the scene with Vincent sticking the needle in Mia was done by having John Travota taking the needle out and running the film backwards because if he had actually jabbed it in He would have broken Uma Thurmans Ribs. The Second Story titled The Gold Watch is about famous boxer Butch Coolidge played by Bruce Willis who is supposed to throw a boxing match but does not and ends up killing his opponent. He and his girlfriend Fabienne played by Maria De Medeiors who are on the run by Marcellus Wallace.

And I think that the entertainment value a certain film may hold is largely over-looked among film critics and most people who watch films with a critical eye. But I hold it as probably the single most important feature in movies in most cases. And by entertainment value I do not only mean how it feels when you are watching the movie but also the picture it leaves on your mind that makes you want to see it again and that you can look back at and actually experience the feeling you gain from actually watching the film. And this is where Shawshank really shines. The 2 hours just went by and left me with a really good feeling after wards for some time. But the other features should not be ignored either in any case. I really like the way Shawshank makes you think. For me it was mostly about how good I actually have it and about life in general. It really made me want to better my ways in all sorts of ways. But unfortunately it wont last forever but thats why its good you can see the movie again. And when you do it will still have the same impact on you as it did the first time around.positive,Despite all the hype I never liked The Lord of the Rings in fact I thought they were stupid. However one day I decided to give it a try and I watched Fellowship of the Ring-one of the greatest movies Ive ever seen. The next day I watched Two Towers and loved it more than Fellowship. Now I just finished watching Return of the King AKA: A masterpiece. Return of the King has everything including 11 Oscars it is tied for the most with Titanic and Ben-Hur also receiving 11 great acting great script and a good story that is exciting almost every minute great heroes great villains Ahem Gollum and a great script. Now you may be expecting me to say So this movie is great but its not its fantastic and by the end you just want to give anyone involved in the making a BIG hug and a Congratulations This movie is one of my favorites Watch this movie after youve seen the slightly worse prequels youll be doing yourself a favor.positive,Deservedly ranked at the top of IMDbs all-time best 250 films ever. The casting is superb: Morgan Freeman is Red a wise observer of people and an entrepreneur inmate whos made connections so he can get contraband to other inmates for a pricepositive,Definitely worth watching again I would say Although it was released 1994 the storyline and the acting were good This movie is a mixture of humour and violence Though the plot and storyline does not really go smooth in a way There happened to be those intersecting story lines in this movie but that is how it attracts the people to watch it isnt it The dialogue and lines in this movie are priceless They were so good and you cant seem to get it out your head I specifically enjoyed the part where Uma Thurman comes into picture I liked her since the movie Kill Bill She is beautiful and she has shown her talented acting portrayed in this role And Samuel L Jackson which I do not really have to elaborate He has this unique way of making appearance and playing a role that no one would be able to forget his rolepositive,Decided to check out IMDb topper as a time pass and was i glad i did.One watch and The Shawshank Redemption has been added to my all time top movies...The golden year of 94 which gave the world some of the best films of all time didnt disappoint with this one...The cast was superb...Tim Robbins is amazing and Morgan freeman again shows why he is at the top.The bond between the main characters is well developed and the climax is mind blowing.The movie gives genuine inspiration and is more than suitable for repeated viewing when one feels down.I give it full 10/10 as it gives u more than a regular film does.It shows the importance of hope in life and why one should never loose it.The Tagline tells it all - FEAR CAN HOLD YOU PRISONERHOPE CAN SET YOU FREE...positive,david fincher is one of those directors i get excited for as soon as a one of his films gets released he just knows how to make a bloody good movie his track record of films is just getting better and better with time so gone girl based on a book by gillian flynn is probably the best film i have seen this year so far it keeps you on the edge of your seat for so long and while it may not have a ground breaking original idea nothing really does nowadays it does it well ben affleck and rosamund pike do great jobs as well as the rest of the cast especially rosamund who really does smash it out of the park i got the same feeling off her as i did from rooney mara from the girl with the dragon tattoo hey look another film mr fincher directed its just an intense thriller with themes that go along with it like marriage and relationships and how we portray ourselves for people in our lives and the public not much to say really apart from watch this moviethe only criticism i can find with the film it is quite long and the opening is slow a build up to a great pay off i feel the book would fill any gaps that other people may find with film and i heard the book has a different ending also so if you do not like the ending maybe read the book for a more satisfying conclusion? the ending for me made sense and maybe open up for a sequel? meh who knows anyone watch this film thanks and hope this was useful for anyone who reads thispositive,david fincher has always been one of the top directors hollywood has to offer and his newest title gone girl helps to showcase that fincher is still at the top of his game fincher gets the most out of his actors ben affleck plays the sympathetic yet deeply flawed nick rosamund pike perfectly captures to sociopathic amy tyler perry gives the best performance ive ever seen from him neil patrick harris plays the stalkerobsessed role extraordinarily well and relative unknown carrie coon is fantastic as nicks sister margo the script of gone girl is fantastic in that it drafts characters that are both sympathetic yet simultaneously deeply unlikeable fincher pays great attention to detail and it really shows in the overall presentation as the film looks beautiful gone girls sound is amazing and helps to build tension and quicken the pace at appropriate times the plot is complex enough to be interesting yet simple enough to be bluntly understood by its audience *spoilers* gone girl revolves around the main character nick affleck who is framed for his wifes pike murder early on there is some ambiguity about if nick had killed amy but this is quickly dispelled as it is seen that amy is alive throughout the movie there had been splices between present day and the story of amy and nicks romance yet these flashbacks dont tell the full story as amy reveals that she was attempting to frame nick for her murder as revenge for his infidelity and because well shes a psycho the story then revolves around the media circus that follows nick and margo around as a witchhunt led by the nancy grace inspired ellen abbott threatens to tear their lives apart all the while nick lawyers up perry plays tanner bolt the lawyer and attempts to prove his innocence the true value in gone girl lies in its social commentary finchers main point comes from the rapid shifting and manipulation of the media the massive character assassination of nick by abbott and others leads to him being portrayed as the most hated man in america when in reality he is innocent the media has massive power and its ironic that nick is eventually loved when amy returns and isnt dead in fact abbott nicks biggest enemy even interviews them to end the movie gone girl is a 1010 movie for me because of how deep the storyline is the movie flies by and i didnt want it to end because of how drawn in i was the performances and writing are fantastic and this movie has to be in strong contention for best picture this yearpositive,david fincher has a longitude of successful booktoscreen adaptations under his belt already fight club and the girl with the dragon tattoo to name some his most recent gone girl based on the best selling 2012 novel is no exception _ and if anything a career best gone girl begins on the fifth anniversary of nick and amy dunne upon which amy goes missing in a sought out search the media circus quickly converge on the investigation and as it escalates pushes nick into the criminal spotlight and accusing him of her murder readily bulked up for batman ben affleck plays writercometeacher nick  whose life gets flipped upside down after amys disappearance known as much for his direction than acting affleck thrives whilst presenting the likable  unlikeable public mask did he kill her?

Christopher Nolan and his co-writer Jonathan Nolan deserve a standing ovation. I dont usually go for loud movies filled with mindless gore and violence. The Dark Knight is certainly loud and violent but its not mindless. It has depth and soul. Even the Joker in an extraordinary creation by Heath Ledger is deeply human. The natural petulance of Christian Bale makes his ego and alter ego the most fascinating and complex of all film superheroes. Part of the genius of this movie is that Batman himself in screen time is not really the lead. My attention was captivated by Heath Ledger and he determines and inspires the breathtaking atmosphere that envelopes Gotham as well as us. The aplomb of Christopher Nolan as a director is mind blowing and his secret I believe is his obvious respect for his audience. What hes done is to elevate a popular genre into Shakesperean proportions. Excellent workpositive,Could a movie be any more perfect This movie is just absolutely stunning in so many ways. Acting perfect storyline perfect soundtrack perfect emotional drama perfect everything about this movie is perfect. When this movie first came out it did not reach the expectations that many people expected it to. But as the years went one it was nominated for seven Academy Awards and as it was available for rent everywhere more people started appreciating it and its popularity grew. Eventually after many years in the top 5 of IMDbs top 250 movies of all time list it hit number 1 with over one million votes. The story is about a well educated vice president of a large bank being wrongly accused of murdering his wife and her lover and is sentenced to spend life at a large prison in new England called Shawshank prison. As the years go on in his new home he makes friends enemys and a dramatic twist at the end which became one of the most legendary scenes in movie history. I love this movie. The acting is just so passionate and their performances increases the drama and horror of life in prison. The soundtrack is one of the main reason behind the emotional drama this movie. Many scenes in this movie almost left me in tears mainly because of the soundtrack in the background which increases the emotion. The cast of this movie include Academy Awards winners Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins. And also William Sadler Bob Gunton and many other who made this movie what it is. Overall it is defiantly the Greatest movie ever made with passionate acting great storyline and plenty of emotional drama about how hope overcomes fear in a beautifully crafted film about the strength of the human spirit.  theyre either angels or devils or souls beset by the latter and in dire need of the former to show them the way out. But who would care if PF hadnt been so well written directed produced or even acted in the first place positive,considering it took 4 separate films to lay the foundation for the avengers what guardians was able to pull off is quite remarkable while i thoroughly enjoyed the avengers what that film lacked was drama  you knew the avengers were going to come out on top with guardians all bets were off because none of the main super heroes are really marvel mainstays like iron man hulk et al this lead to a much more suspenseful film while the film does an excellent job developing characters that the audience is emotionally invested in where guardians truly shines is as a comedy chris pratt does a great job being a lovable goofball super hero add to all this beautiful visuals  the nova corps battle scenes are sensational and you basically have a perfect family filmpositive,Comments on the now completed film - not just ROTK. Say friend and enter else let your prejudice prevent your respecting what is categorically the greatest cinematic achievement to date. Imagine having the arrogance to believe that you have the vision and imaginative energy to put together a ten hour film that does justice to the seminal work of fantasy literature..... Take a step back my cynical friends and measure this extraordinary accomplishment against the mountains of uninspired patronizing Holywood rubbish with which we are daily assailed. Consider the sheer hotspur and determination required to see the work to its conclusion and to remain consistent and steadfast to the vision over many years. Think of the thousands of actors and technicians with whom you must have the energy and communication skills to share your vision. No. No one has come close to this as an achievement. Even if the end product were merely so so Id be saying the same thing. But regardless of the quibbles that you are bound to have with something this provocative - Jacksons The Lord of the Rings is a far better movie than anything this long has a right to be. LOTR is comparable in breadth and success with Wagners Ring Cycle or the Michaelangelos Sistine Chapel and with Tolkiens original novel of course. To bring together convincingly all the elements required to make the film a success is no less a worthy achievement than these gesumptkunstwerk. Many criticisms arise from judging the three movies separately. This is incredibly unfair imho. The ending of ROTK is not too long when considered the end of a ten hour movie. Similarly the final Opera of Wagners Ring cycle is fairly pointless without the proceeding three and is rarely performed or judged on its own. Now Im not a Wagner nut myself - but this doesnt stop me from appreciating what is an incredible work of art. Its a shame that small rather petty prejudices - born often out of loyalty to other movies as much as basic fantasyphobia - prevent some a tiny minority for sure from appreciating the film for what it is. Id ask the cynics to take the time and effort to stand back and admire LOTR from an objective distance. For some this is a long walk. However the view like the location in which it was shot is breathtaking. Youve shot straight at your friends headAnd when you wake upyouve taken s--t in the car and its full of blood and skull pieces.What will you do to hide from the copsThere are many things like this.Well its great.Enjoy the acts and screenplay.Some dialogs are so funny some are about bad things.Pulp Fiction is a real pulp fiction.PULP FICTION IS THE LORD. positive,Comic book movies as we know them are over. Gone are the special effects laden cartoons like The Incredible Hulk and Fantastic Four. Consider this the official death of a movie like Superman Returns which was beyond terrible. The Dark Knight redefines the comic book movie and changes all the possibilities of where superheroes go and what theyre capable of. There should be no doubt that the driving force in this film is the ever maniacal Joker. I wouldnt doubt the fact that hes probably going to go down as the greatest comic film villain of all time after being portrayed so brilliantly and effortlessly by the late Heath Ledger. The Joker never fails to deliver the most diabolical and sinister games that force all the films heroes to have to make sometimes painful choices. In his own words Im an agent of chaos. Bruce Wayne Christian Bale realizes that to stop the Joker he has to become something he swore never to be. This results in an interesting turn of events that really cant be put into words but I will tell you it involves a chase scene. The film really crosses the line in terms of the traditional comic book film in its exploration of human nature and raises implications on social political and moral levels. The last time I saw a movie with that many themes was the multiple Academy Award winning Children of Men. Personally Ive always felt films that use fiction to explore the current reality we live in or the ramifications of our decisions usually give us a cold harsh reality check. Christopher Nolans screenplay and choice of dialog is more complex than any comic film not to mention considerably more poetic. Gotham City let Batman operate without having to answer to the law. What happens when you give one man all the power Gotham City District Attorney Harvey Dent Aaron Eckhart explains When their enemies were at the gates the Romans would suspend democracy and appoint one man to protect the city. It wasnt considered an honor it was considered a service. His girlfriend who also happens to be Bruces ex-girlfriend Rachel Dawes Maggie Gyllenhaal shoots back Harvey The last man to protect the Republic was named Caesar A lot of these implications wouldnt be relevant if we werent living in post 9/11 America so I recommend you read up on something called Executive Unitary Theory to get the full effect of giving one man all the power. Apart of what made this film so hard hitting was the stellar performances. None of them were actors this time they were actors who completely lost themselves in the characters they built every one of which we come to care about. Lieutenant Jim Gordons Gary Oldman promotion to Police Commissioner is well deserved. The movie also allows Oldman to take Gordon to new heights and really shows how Batman and Gordon are in this together and Gordon as a character really comes of age. The Dark Knight in the end wasnt merely about good and evil. It was about the fight for Gotham and showing the citys people that you could overcome evil with good. Early on someone mentions that Harvey Dent is Gotham Citys White Knight. Dent is a handsome well educated elected official. The people paint the picture of him as this incorruptible force of good. Batman on the other hand is a vigilante  and worthy it was. The fascinating performance of Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins the direction and everything puts you in the place of the actors making you feel the way they felt. This movie doesnt have any dirty romance or impossible actions rather it focuses on a greater philosophy - Hope to live when there is no hope survival -- This is one movie that will leave you talking about it even many days after watching. I wont say anymore the rest is up-to you to find out when you see the movie positive,Christopher Nolans work is amazing. visually stunning powerful and moving. Too bad heath ledger couldnt make more like these. Dialogues are equally lifted by beautiful acting. I cannot imagine anybody else replacing any of the current cast and end up doing it better. Neither could this have been made a better movie had it been directed by anyone else. It raised the expectations so much that to me the sequel seemed weaker. dark knight beats dark knight rises hands down any time of the millennium. watched it more than once especially for the joker. this is one of the movies where i would be eagerly waiting for the villain. have to rate it 10 on 10. too bad that it was only a 3 movie contract.positive,Christopher Nolans The Dark Knight is my favorite movie of all time. This movie created my love for movies and even for Batman and the Joker. From the moment that Hans Zimmers gripping  beings in the opening scene to the first time we see Heath Ledger give the performance of a lifetime as the clown prince of crime I was hooked. The setting feels dark gloomy and even evil at times but yet I am compelled to buy a plane ticket to the city. I would like to say that this is because of Batman that I want to fight the crime in Gotham and be a member of the GCPD but less corrupt. But the truth is that I want to see the Joker from a safe distance. The Joker offers such high levels of charisma and dark humor that you dont have to fool yourself by saying you love to hate him. Be honest you hate that you love him. In this city of corrupt cops dirty money white collar crime and gang activity who better to look to than someone who makes even the most wicked of people look sane. Nolan has presented a world where the joker isnt so much a mad clown as he is a mad scientist. Maybe he lacks morals but even his most convoluted plans are artfully crafted. The Dark Knight is not a comic book movie. The Dark Knight is an action movie based on comic book locations and characters. That seems simple enough but I stand by the fact that it is the only film of its kind including the other two in the trilogy. Even the best of comic book movies such as Iron Man or The Avengers are still very much comic book movies. The Dark Knight was able to rise above that title to become something more than that. Christian Bale gave us the best performance as Bruce Wayne as seen on the big screen to-date and Heath Ledger gave us possibly the greatest performance of all time as the joker. I do not give this  to films very often but The Dark Knight is undoubtedly a 10/10.positive,Christopher Nolans The Dark Knight changed things forever. Theres no going back. It is one of the few films that was thought to be one thing and ended up becoming one of the greatest films of all time. This was the first movies I saw where I talked about things that were discussed in the film itself and what it must mean to be a hero like Batman. But more importantly the acting writing directing and the cinematography make this a rich and tragic film that will forever stand the test of time. The story begins a couple months after the events of Batman Begins in a noticeably more realistic Gotham City and batman has petty criminals and the mob running scared. The determined new D.A. Harvey Dent emerges as another symbol of hope for Gotham City albeit a more lawful position as Batman. Then enter The Joker a demented terrorist who sets up unbelievably dark and twisted situations to test the moral compasses of Batman Dent and even Commissioner Gordon. As a man Bruce Wayne has a crisis is Batman doing more harm than he is good he learns that he may become something more awful than the Joker just to stop him. Director Christopher Nolan leaves behind all the jokiness and sometimes unfulfilled soul searching of the previous Batman films and with his trilogy this more than others redefines what a superhero movie can be. He shows the characters for what they are flawed but idealistic as well as struggling to deal with the Joker as they themselves descend into a very dark place. Nolan and his brother Jonathon have given us a very polished and well thought out story by itself. This is the second film where I actually paid attention and love the story characters and became emotionally invested the first was Toy Story long ago And then there is the acting. The acting is top notch by all actors. The real star of this movie is the scene-stealing Joker played by Heath Ledger. He transforms the Joker from all previous incarnations and puts a very demented and modern twist on it. He truly believes he is humanity fully realized and an agent of chaos the theme of the film He wants to turn the Gothamites into wild animals who will according to him eat each other when the chips are down. Ledger very deservedly although posthumously won the Oscar for this portrayal and is still being hailed as one of the best villains in any medium. Christian Bale is in top form as Bruce Wayne/Batman and gives you a tender and heartbreaking side to the character. He does begin to build his mythos but struggles when people doubt him and push their fears onto what he stands for. I will say the actor who really got me invested was Harvey Dent played by Aaron Eckhart. Two-Face is one of the more tragic villains of the Batman rogues gallery. He is a truly moral and good man fallen from grace by tragedy in his life losing Rachael to one of Jokers vicious traps It hurts Bruce too in a love triangle that for once in my life I thought was very well constructed and perfect He becomes an evil and twisted brute who relies on a coin to make a decision to kill for him. Chance. Unbiased Unprejudiced FAIR. He too was a villain I thought equal to the Joker but in a different way. it is rather emotional when things happen to him and that is the sign of a great storytelling and acing approach. Commissioner Gordon played by Gary Oldman presents a man who knows the system is corrupt but remains idealistic and knows that Batman is doing good for the city. And at the end knows he will have to atone and be accountable for any sins he may have committed over the course of the film. The action scene are a wonder to behold. They look real and was pulled off with little to no computers all real stunts. Nothing was over the top at all even Two-faces design looked scary and oddly enough like he got burned by something on one half of his body. Every incarnation before this looks awful by comparison. Every scene in this film showcases cinematographer Wally Pfisters rich color palette/lighting scheme and his keen eye for detail even in the simplest scenes. He and Nolan will go down as one of the great cinematographer/director duos ever. This film is a a perfect work of art. The Dark Knght really was a game changer when released in 2008 showing the industry and fans what a comic-book movie can be just as Richard Donners Superman had done in 1978. This is a movie that I loved dearly on my first screening and one that will not disappear off my list.positive,Christopher Nolans sequel to Batman Begins is absolutely brilliant. The Dark Knight offers everything you want in a film. A hero who must push himself to stop a criminally insane man who only enjoys chaos. The cast did such an amazing job. Returning from Batman Begins is Christian Bale Michael Caine Gary Oldman and Morgan Freeman. Coming aboard we had Aaron Eckharts character Harvey Dent. With also Heath Ledger who played the villainous Joker who was absolutely phenomenal. This movie had me on the edge of my seat the entire time making me wonder Whats going to happen next If you have not seen this movie yet watch it. You will not regret it.positive,Christopher Nolans sequel to 2005s Batman Begins is one of those rare films that transcends the boundaries and preconceptions of its genre and becomes something much much more. From the very opening shot you know youre in for something different - something special. Batman is not alone in his fight to rid Gotham of organized crime and poverty-driven violence teaming up with a hotshot district attorney and his ever faithful friend in the police department Jim Gordon. But none of them see whats really coming - a dark malevolent force of nature called Joker. This isnt your fathers goofy wise-cracking clown...this Joker played iconically by the late Heath Ledger is a maniacal anarchic nihilistic beast hell-bent on the dismantling of civilizationpositive,Christopher Nolans second bundle of joy The Dark Knight EXCEEDED all of my expectations With the success of 2005s reboot of the Batman franchise they took what was already established and expanded it amped it up and gave a deeper darker and brooding story that is more gripping and the suspense is likely to catch you of guard several times throughout. Christian Bale delves more deeper into Batman sworn to fight evil and injustice though also quite reluctant and uncertain if his crusade can ever end and cleanse his inner turmoil from his fractured soul due to the murder of his beloved parents. But with the help of his trusted butler/ally Alfred played superbly by Michael Cane grounds him gives him moral support and keeps him in check. But the real star of the show is Heath Ledger as Batmans most deadly enemy The Joker. I can HONESTLY tell you that: as good as Jack Nicholson was in Batman89 he is CHILDS PLAY compared to this Joker. He is sadistic psychotic and downright SCARIER and PSYCHOLOGICALLY disturbing than the previous incarnation of The Clown Prince of Crime and Ledger gives it his all to do him justice. Along with the original cast comes some fresh faces such as Aaron Eckhart Maggie Gyllenhaal and more. I must say though I liked Katie Holmes Gyllenhaal gives a much better performance and is a far cry from the damsel-in-distress stereotype though theres a little of it THANKFULLY thats common in films. Bale and Gyllenhall have MUCH better chemistry this time around more so than Holmes. Even better the fight sequences are vastly improved and feature more brutal and bone crushing combat than Begins in addition to new technology at Batmans disposal. Also worth mentioning is screenwriter Jonathan Nolan who gives the film an added frosting to an already delicious cake. Simply put The Dark Knight is totally more bad ass than Begins. The action is great and the plot is more deeper and engrossing. I applaud Christopher Nolan Christian Bale and especially Heath Ledger who sadly passed away earlier this year and all those aboard for believing in Mr. Nolans talents for this second installment. Although some may feel a bit of melancholy over Ledgers death but as a final note I will say this sincerely from my heart: Remember Heath Ledger and honor him in your minds and hearts not only for his performances but as a human being and father to his daughter Matilda Ledger. May we issue him best wishes for his family and friends and his daughter for years to come. Remember . . . Honor him not only for this role and past roles but as an incredible individual and talented actor. Rest in peace. Heath Ledger: 4/4/1979-1/22/2008.positive,Christopher Nolans latest film in the batman movie franchise is superb. The acting is some of the best i have ever seen you really feel like you know these characters at a personal level by the end. The joker really pushes batman closer and closer to the line the separates crime-fighter and vigilante. And Bruce Wayne struggles to keep his personal life away from his batman side. Heath ledger is amazing as the joker he does everything correct even the signature laugh. At one part the joker is sticking his head out of a police car enjoying the chaos that he just put upon Gotham. Throughout the movie Batman constantly struggles to thwart the jokers plans of mayhem before they can take effect and he fails for the most part until the end but i shant spoil that. This movie is the darkest batman movie ever this new take on the batman franchise is great. And this movie really embodies how Nolan wants Batman to be. And the movie is just overall amazingpositive,Christopher Nolan steps back into the directors chair for this sequel to Batman Begins which finds the titular superhero coming face to face with his greatest nemesis -- the dreaded Joker. Christian Bale returns to the role of Batman Maggie Gyllenhaal takes over the role of Rachel Dawes played by Katie Holmes in Batman Begins and Brokeback Mountain star Heath Ledger dons the ghoulishly gleeful Joker makeup previously worn by Jack Nicholson and Cesar Romero.

Christian Bale returns to the role of Batman Maggie Gyllenhaal takes over the role of Rachel Dawes and Brokeback Mountain star Heath Ledger dons the ghoulishly gleeful Joker makeup previously worn by Jack Nicholson and Cesar Romero. Just as it begins to appear as if Batman Lt. James Gordonplayed by Gary Oldman and District Attorney Harvey Dentportrayed by Aaron Eckhart are making headway in their tireless battle against the criminal element a maniacal wisecracking fiend plunges the streets of Gotham City into complete chaos.Nolans inspiration for the film was the Jokers comic book debut in 1940 and the 1996 series The Long Halloween which retold Two-Faces origin. In addition elements of Steve Englehart and Marshall Rogers Dark Detective miniseries as well as the unpublished follow-up were reportedly cannibalized along with other elements of Batman mythology for the story. In Gotham City the Joker and accomplices rob a mob-owned bank the Joker killing off the others and escaping alone. Batman and Lieutenant Jim Gordon decide to include the district attorney Harvey Dent in on their plan to bring down Gothams mob currently led by Sal Maroni. Batmans alter ego Bruce Wayne meets Dent and Rachel Dawes deciding to host a fund raiser to show his support for Dent. The Joker approaches the mob offering them his services should they need it. Corrupt accountant Lau working for the mob flees to Hong Kong but is dragged back to Gotham by Batman agreeing to testify against the mob.Maroni and the Chechen turn to the Joker who begins murdering people on a daily basis unless Batman unmasks himself. Among the casualties are Commissioner Loeb. The Joker targets Dent at the fund raiser Bruce hiding him. The Joker tries to assassinate Mayor Garcia during Loebs memorial service Gordon taking the bullet and seemingly dying. Rachel is targeted Bruce and Alfred Pennyworth looking after her. At a press conference Dent claims he is Batman instead of Bruce who planned to confess to the public and is escorted by police to county prison. The Joker intercepts but is caught by Gordon who faked his death. Gordon is promoted to Commissioner as a reward. However Rachel and Dent both disappear Batman confronting the Joker and learning both are in building filled with explosives. Batman and Gordon go to save them Batman finding Dent and saving him but Rachel is killed when the explosives detonate. Dents face is set on fire and half of it is left severely scarred. The Joker escapes from the Gotham police department with Lau.Coleman Reese an accountant working at Wayne Enterprises under Lucius Fox realizes Bruce is Batman and plans to publicly expose him. The Joker who kills Lau and the Chechen threatens to bomb a hospital unless Reese is killed. Gordon rescues Reese while the Joker visits the crazed Dent in hospital convincing him to get revenge on those who truly killed Rachel. Dent kills Officer Wuertz and spares Maroni and Officer Anna Ramirez using his lucky coin to decide their fate. The Joker threatens to takeover the city putting two ferries of citizens and Arkham Asylum inmates against one another giving them to decision to blow each other up. Batman confronts the Joker aided by Lucius using a machine able to detect phones across the city and use them as a locator. The ferry passengers refuse to kill each other and Batman captures the Joker but not before he learns of Dents rampage. Dent lures Gordon to the building where Rachel died holding his family hostage and threatens to shoot his son. Batman arrives tackling Dent off the building to his death.Deciding to take the blame for Dents victims Batman forces Gordon to make him a fugitive and portray Dent as Gothams true hero. In the closing scenes Gordon destroys the Bat Signal and Lucius watches the locator machine self-destruct and Batman flees the police Gordon considering Batman the citys real hero. Dark complex and unforgettable The Dark Knight succeeds not just as an entertaining comic book film but as a richly thrilling crime saga.It becomes more than just a superhero film unlike the others released like SupermanSpidermanGreen Latern and many others as it was more than a comic-book adventure but a sprawling crime epic.Allusions to our current struggles with surveillance public perception and terrorism are thrown into the mix adding political immediacy to Nolans psycho noir.The acting of the cast was simply superb and outstanding particularly the late Heath Ledgerwhose last role the Joker would still go down in cinema history as one of the most creepily unhinged big-screen bad guys of all time.Finallythis also proves that Christopher Nolan is much much smarter than your average filmmaker.It was simply one of the best films ever made and the best superhero film ever made.positive,Christopher Nolan has effectively raised the bar for movie makers everywhere Including the big American cojunasin terms of execution and for movie goers in terms of expectations. This film works on every single level. The cast is excellent.. Christian Bale delivers again as the best batman the franchise has ever produced.Although not perfect Mrs Gyllenhal does a very good job as The Vigilantes love interest and not as aesthetically appealing as Katie Holms but much more credible .Aaron Eckhart comes as the dark horse of this film who would have thought Mister cool had those types of acting chops in him credit to the whip of Mr. Nolan.The screenplay is pure goldThe dialogue are cunning straight and emotionally mature.you couldnt find any clich’© or meaningless word in here. It is a pity this movie did no receive the academy nomination it has been a long time since the last time i watched a movie as good as this. In true Mr Nolan has anointed himself new king of Hollywood This movie is indeed pure cinematic artit has action dramacomedy it has everything and it also has a great uplifting ending. Hail to the new king of movies and keep on making thempositive,christopher nolan has created a superb film that can be enjoyable for those of all ages the story was rich with emotions action and excitement as matthew mcconaughey gives us an oscarworthy display of acting the special effects were absolutely wonderful and the amazing audio that hans zimmer provided only added to the movies toptier development ive seen the movie multiple times and in each of those fullypacked theatre moments i was in people stood up clapping and cheering and then left with the largest smiles on their faces which achieved the actual point of movies pleasing the people and giving them something to remember not to meet standards that grouchy and lonely so called critics set to make it boring and stupid it seems like many nolan haters and so called astrophysicists all criticize the film by attacking nolan not the film this is laughable because for one no one will pay attention to their comments besides other nolan haters who will vote yes agree by filtering for and finding fellow worst reviews this film will stay in the top 50 or maybe even reach the top 10 as things are looking right now and the haters will drown in the crowd of people who acknowledge and can see that this is a great movie as interstellar soars high haters can look up wave goodbye and stay on the low ground that they cant leave frompositive,Christopher Nolan comes back to direct the 2nd Batman movie which finds the titular superhero face to face with his greatest nemesis - the dreaded Joker. Christian Bale returns to the role of Batman Maggie Gyllenhaal takes over the role of Rachel Dawes from Katie Holmes. Heath Ledger makes the appearance as the Joker previously stared by Jack Nicholson. Just as it appears that Batman Jim Gordon and the DA Harvey Dent is making progress against organized crime they face their deadliest foe yet a complete maniac turns Gotham city into chaos. Four opposites makes an excellent blending to create one of the most perfect movies ever made.  Believe me this film is made for multiple viewings...Dont hate this after viewing it once or twice give it at least more than 2 viewings before you make up your mind. Im POSITIVE it will become more and more better after each viewing and probably you will end up loving it. If not maybe it was just not your Cup Of Tea. I hope this film satisfies everyone and I really dont care if its No.1 on the IMDb or outside Top250. Its not fair to hate a film because your favourite is not above it in the rankings Its a deeply satisfying movie that makes you understand the importance of HOPE. 9.8/10 P.S. Technically{all round film-making} it may not be the greatest movie of all-time{that honor can go to Godfather/LOTR:ROTK/Star Wars 4etc.} BUT it certainly goes down in my book as one of the finest and a movie to savour for ages. positive,children i shall be talking about interstellar but before i do i think i better give you a little context just to show how high my expectations were for this film i love christopher nolan i am a nolanite or nolanoid or whatever people who like christopher nolan are called ive pretty much loved every film hes ever done it confuses me when people slag him off because hes clearly the best writerdirector to be working on mainstream blockbuster films since steven spielberg only i think that his films are much better than stevens his films are only so thrilling because of the intimacy he creates between the audience and the characters as soon as i heard christopher nolans next film was a scifi film called interstellar i was excited i was so excited that i only treated myself to one viewing of the teaser trailer and first trailer it was enough i was sold and i didnt want to see any other trailer because i wanted to know and see as little as possible i decided that interstellar needed to be seen in imax so i booked my ticket to see interstellar on the biggest screen in the uk even though the film had garnered some mixed reviews i was hoping for fullon rave ones like when the dark knight and inception came out i still put my trust into christopher to deliver me something extraordinary i dont know if its the gigantic screen talking but interstellar absolutely delivered this was the best experience ive ever had at the cinema the huge screen and earpopping sound made the experience incredibly intense and by the end of it i felt like i had been for a little trip out in space im not sure if this will translate quite so well on your tv screen at home however the film is unmissable whatever you choose to see it on whilst a lot of the film does rely on extraordinary visuals and heartstopping setpieces at its heart its an intimate family drama which suggests that your children are your one and only important universe i was absolutely sucked into the film from the moment it started the stuff before matthew goes into space is probably some of the best stuff in the film we learn so much about coop and he becomes a worthy character to invest three hours into three hours which fly by i might add theres a strong focus on the relationship between coop and his daughter and its this relationship which drives the film right up to and including its jawdropping conclusion the first hour is also quite funny too which was a nice surprise as nolan doesnt normally dabble in too much humour theres a really emotional scene where coop wants to say goodbye to his daughter who he doesnt know when hes going to see again before his space travels its beautifully acted by both matthew mcconaughey and mackenzie foy and is at the powerful centre of the whole film after this the film adopts an entirely new setting literally were blasted off into space and the fun really begins the less you know about the space scenes the better as its a lot of fun to try and work out just where the film is going suffice to say that interstellar is jampacked with eyepopping visuals and intense thrills which dwarf last years gravity into a speck of space dust by comparison with the dark knight rises christopher proved that he could direct on a big scale and interstellar is his biggest yet he has an ambition which most directors lack and instead of kicking him down for it we should be nurturing it interstellar presents us with new and exciting ideas which colossally blow other mainstream films out of the water the action is also elevated to unreachable new heights thanks to hans zimmers astonishing  its a haunting piece of music that will be ringing in your head for hours after the film has finished hes left the big drums and strings behind and reinvented himself with a bizarre church organ which perfectly matches the dark atmosphere of the film a lot of people have expressed a strong disliking to the final 40 minutes of interstellar i can see why as up until then the film is more or less possible to understand its complex but its still easy enough to follow however christopher completely rips up the rule book and interstellar goes seriously barmy in the last 40 minutes personally i loved the third act and it just goes to show the sheer creativity and ambition which christopher nolan has going inside his head i found it all very interesting both on a visual and intellectual level i dont understand it all but i have my theories and im sure that there will be a mountain of theories cropping up on the interweb interstellar is a truly remarkable experience it boasts awesome ideas and visuals but it never forgets its heart im a tough cookie to make cry but im not going to lie ooh poetry there were three occasions when i had tears filling up in my eyes there are some astonishingly powerful and moving scenes in there which reminds me why i go to the cinema i dont just want crazy visuals and excitement i want to be moved and i want to be invested in characters so that i care what happens to them at the end interstellar more than achieves that ill need to give it another watch to work out where id put it on christopher nolans mesmerising filmography but he hasnt let me down i hope that interstellar is seen as a scifi classic in years to come because it really does deserve that accolade read

He praises the performances direction and writing and says the film redefine the possibilities of the comic-book movie. Ebert states that the key performance is by Heath Ledger and pondered whether he would become the first posthumous Academy Award-winning actor since Peter Finch in 1976. Ledger ultimately won the Oscar he awarded the film four stars out of four.Ebert named it one of his twenty favorite films of 2008. Peter Travers of Rolling Stone writes that the film is deeper than its predecessor with a deft script that refuses to scrutinize the Joker with popular psychology instead pulling the viewer in with an examination of Bruce Waynes psyche.Travers has praise for all the cast saying each brings his or her A game to the film. He says Bale is electrifying evoking Al Pacino in The Godfather Part II and that Eckharts portrayal of Harvey Dent is scarily moving.Travers says the actor moves the Joker away from Jack Nicholsons interpretation into darker territory and expresses his support for any potential campaign to have Ledger nominated for an Academy AwardTravers says that the filmmakers move the film away from comic book cinema and closer to being a genuine work of art citing Nolans direction and the gritty reality of Wally Pfisters cinematography as helping to create a universe that has something raw and elemental at work within it. In particular he cites Nolans action choreography in the IMAX-tailored heist sequence as rivaling that of Heat 1995. Manohla Dargis of The New York Times wrote Pitched at the divide between art and industry poetry and entertainment it goes darker and deeper than any Hollywood movie of its comic-book kind. Entertainment Weekly put it on its end-of-the-decade best-of list saying Every great hero needs a great villain. And in 2008 Christian Bales Batman found his in Heath Ledgers demented dervish the Joker. It is one of the best movie ever from Christopher Nolan. All in all though these are fairly niggling complaints. The Dark Knight isnt perfect but no film really is or could be. Still while someone someday might make a better superhero movie the bar has been set very very high. The Dark Knight isnt just the best movie of the summer its the best movie of the year so far and everything else is going to have to try very very hard to top it. Verdict Ledgers performance is monumental but The Dark Knight lives up to it. Nolan cements his position as Hollywoods premier purveyor of blockbuster smarts Š—– and the Batbike is kinda cool too. Rating - 10 out of 10 t care as hanks did as much as a good job as freeman did if better. Tim Robbins was also amazing and likable with the supporting cast doing perfection to the highest level. The  is beautiful the mies en scene the scripting writing is gold and genius making this a classic. This film is not complex and it is something that makes it just so darn good. The pacing is perfect and the narration from freeman is timeless. The iconic shots of Andy raising is hands in the air after escape is timeless as and should be attempted when finishing school as i have did. A film highly recommend by me and others as well touched me to the point of joy and laughter and will bloom your day as it always will live as cinemas most beloved classic ever. 5/5 positive,Can Hollywood usually creating things for entertainment purposes only create art To create something of this nature a director must approach it in a most meticulous manner due to the delicacy of the process. Such a daunting task requires an extremely capable artist with an undeniable managerial capacity and an acutely developed awareness of each element of art in their films the most prominent  that he had wished you had died instead of your brother. Youd feel grief-stricken. The look on Faramirs face in conjunction with the sorrowful music playing in the background makes it such a powerful scene. With watery eyes Faramir then says Since you were robbed of Boromir I will do what I can in his stead so then Faramir gathers his men to ride back out to Osgiliath in a fruitless battle to reclaim the city. Its such a sad scene because you know Faramir does not have enough men to reclaim the city but he goes anyway to uphold the honour he has for his brother and halfwitted father. The whole scene is in slo- motion with Pippin singing sadly in the background as the Orcs draw their bows to kill Faramir and his men charging towards the overrun city. Its just all so sad and Im pretty certain this scene will be very potent and indelible in my mind. In the battle for Minasterith Aragon saves the day with his army of the undead which to me pretty much felt like him putting in a cheat code and just demolishing every Orc Troll and Mumakil on the battlefield. And this leads me to another point - Gimli and Legolass friendship. I loved watching their friendship grow stronger and seeing these two characters learn to tolerate each other over the three films. I also cherish the humour in their relationship I mean how can you not laugh after Legolas impressively takes down a Mumakil all by himself and Gimli apathetically comments That still only counts as one I love scenes like this that lighten-up the mood of solemn situations. One of the stand out performances however in the entire movie is by Samwise Gamgee. As the voice of reason in Frodos head Sam tries to tell him that Gollum is plotting to kill both of them and take the ring for himself but because Gollum can empathise with Frodo he believes Gollums stories. When Frodo is poisoned and paralysed by Shelob the giant spider I really enjoyed seeing Sam battle her and be all courageous and brave and dexterous. As Frodo becomes weaker Sam needs to become stronger and thats exactly what happens. When the two Hobbits finally reach the volcano Sam determinedly carries Frodo up the mountain to the entrance that really demonstrates his development as a character in which the ring is later finally destroyed. It was interesting to see Gollum hold the ring close to his chest as he falls down into the pit of lava yet even as hes sinking and burning and dying his one thought is to try save the ring. It just shows how evil can be tenacious and follow people to their death. In essence I felt this movie was the perfect way to end such a memorable trilogy. Peter Jackson did a superb job to make all the characters unique and significant in their own way and encapsulate what life is like during Middle Earth. The setting the costumes the characters the CGI and the story were all presented perfectly in a trilogy that will never be forgotten. positive,Bye far the best movie in the world and by far Tarantino best piece of work to date  The cast for the movie is outstanding and even the cameo from the main man Harvey Keitel was the dogs This movie deserves to be number 1 positive,By the conclusion of the first scene I knew I was in for something special The film is successful because all factors of the film are brilliantly executed. The screenplay which is written by the Nolan brother is magnificent with many a remarkable scene. The costume and makeup correspond well particularly the joker his makeup and costume ensures that his physical appearance is all but unforgettable. Christopher Nolan and his crew shoot spectacular fast paced action sequences throughout the film we witness batman not once but twice used cars to break his fall and he outdoes himself on the second by catching his love interest Rachel in midair. The joker uses a mans to aid him in his magic trick  making a pencil disappear. Batman is nearly torn apart by dogs while Harvey Dent suffers serious burns to half his face although perhaps the most extravagant action sequence is the destruction of the bat mobile and then witnessing whats left transform into a motorbike. However the true beauty behind this film is the acting. Every actor delivers a strong performance with noteworthy mentions to Aaron Eckhart with his unfortunate heartbroken and twisted Harvey Dent Michael Caine and his loyal wise and heartwarming butler as well as Christian Bale and his tormented determined and smooth billionaire as well as his fearsome awe inspiring alter ego The Dark Knight. Nonetheless the highest praise must be given to Ledger. Ledger transforms himself into this psychotic villain becoming unrecognizable as the smiling humble actor we all knew him as delivering one of the greatest performances I have ever witnessed. In conclusion during the whole 2 hours and 32 minutes not once did I take my eyes of the screen. Christopher Nolans The dark knight is entertaining inspiring and terrifyingly beautiful.positive,By far the best movie ever... No Doubt this is the best ever movie you will ever see It is easily the best movie of my life-time so far. Morgan Free is a legend and Rest of the Crew did a marvellous job as well. Well written / narrated and directed movie of all times. 10 out 10. It has been on number one ranking on IMDb and most of the other movie rating websites forever now. The best past of the movie is narrated voice by Morgan Freeman. The character Andy Dufrain is a very well composed and the Warden character has lot of punch into it. Escape from prison was the best it can ever get. Marvellous piece of Art.  Pulp Fiction. Its pertaining to old comic book strips usually containing lurid subject matter with a modern day twist. The film conveys this perfectly through the eyes of characters: Vince Jules and Butch played by Travolta Jackson and Willis. The non-linear time sequence also allows the audience to become more submerged in the multilateral plot by understanding how each characters actions eventually effect anthers causing the plot to intertwine narratives. The cool 1950s - 1970s rock n roll music also saturates the film in a cool and eccentric atmosphere which is then juxtaposed with gratuitous violence sexual violence and drug themes. This feeling is perfectly described by one scene of Travoltas character Vincent driving a cherry red convertible cadillac down a road at high speed with Mia Wallace Uma Thurman overdosing on heroin in the back seat. This is how the film makes you feel when it reaches its climax. On the other hand the relief comes with witty dialogue and great humour which makes you think about pop culture and society. The whole film is an absolute ride and my favourite of all time. positive,By far the best comic book movie todate. But the The Dark Knight is also one of the best movies ever made. Unfortunately it sets a standard for movies that few can ever surpass. Batman is no longer a comic book character. Torn from its comic book pages Christopher Nolan has taken Batman far beyond anything the original creators Bob Kane & Bill Finger could ever Imagine. One of the few Blockbuster Summer movies That is dynamic Thought-provoking intense and Fun. Heath Ledger gives a performance that is unmatched by any other actor. His portrayal of the Joker is so perfectly disturbing it is almost scary. Directing Story Acting and  are superb. 10 out of 10positive,but... in the end of the movie when the hobbits arrive to the shire in the original book they encounter to the shire ruled by Saruman.. in my opinion its a total offense to the book and their fans because the fight between the hobbits and saruman his very important to the hobbits. They leave the shire being a cowards but when return they are totally changed in the sense of warrior spirit and courage. Anyway the movie is excellent.positive,Brilliant movie Unbelievable acting Incredible effects And a creepy evil that truly feels like a threat. Nolans magnum opus The Dark Knight focuses on the psychological aspects of the characters and takes you on an unpredictable unbelievable ride you wont soon forget. The film does well in introducing characters and developing on them while also weaving a dark story of organized crime and chaos. Ledger was well deserving of his Oscar Nolan sure does know how to make a completely engrossing film. The cast has done a superb job in portraying their characters without going overboard. Christian Bale returns giving both sides of Bruce Wayne equal attention the playboy and the hero as he did in the first film. Aaron Eckhart and Maggie Gyllenhaal also give fine performances. But it is the Joker that really makes the film terrifying. He is insane but believably played by Heath Ledger.positive,brilliant breathtaking thrilling these are some of the words that describe mission impossible the plot is really interesting although it may seem confusing if we take our eyes off the screen for some seconds brian de palma one of my favourite directors adds one more masterpiece to his career the cast leaded by tom cruise in a great role has important names as jon voight jean reno vanessa redgrave emilio estevez and kristin scott thomas emmanuelle bart is also great definitely not to be missed my rate 910positive,brilliant breathtaking thrilling these are some of the words that describe mission impossible the plot is really interesting although it may seem confusing if we take our eyes off the screen for some seconds brian de palma one of my favourite directors adds one more masterpiece to his career the cast leaded by tom cruise in a great role has important names as jon voight jean reno vanessa redgrave emilio estevez and kristin scott thomas emmanuelle b_art is also great definitely not to be missed my rate 910positive,brilliant absolutely brilliant from start to finish this was an all around great movie and is pretty much the film im always looking to find every twist and turn was completely unexpected which can be pretty rare in a dramathrillerif your reading these reviews most likely you want to watch or already have and if your in the category of wanting to watch do it you will not regret iti really didnt think i would even enjoy this for some odd reason but after the first ten minutes that changed and for me to be able to say that thats a total plus in my book ps for all the lovely ladies ben affleck and tyler perry are some serious eye candy to boot enjoypositive,Breathtaking Mesmerising Shocking Brilliant These are just a handful of words you can use to describe Pulp Fiction without doubt one of the best movies of modern cinema Describing its non-linear plot is tricky it has to be seen to be fully comprehended Basically Pulp Fiction is really three different stories two hit men and an eventful morning trying to deliver a mysterious briefcase to their boss another is one of these hit men Vincent Vega played by John Travolta taking the boss wife out to dinner to keep her company while he is out of town and the third is an experiences boxer trying to earn some big bucks before retiring with his girlfriend The brilliant thing about the plot is the fact that it is presented out of chronological sequence and at times from different perspectives Dramatic biblical monologues are repeated threefold and we see characters who have died in a previous scene reappearing in the next scene Combined with this is the sublime screenplay written by Tarantino is perhaps the best ever committed to film With defining performances from John Travolta Samueal L Jackson and Uma Thurman as well as Bruce Willis only add to the films brilliancepositive,Bravo finally this truly was a quality film the acting directing and writing this film is like something youve never seen from a superhero / comic book adaptation films. Let me start with the acting Heath ledger... everything has already been said about this performance yet he still managed to surprise me what a performance hats off he really does get under your skin created togather with writers of course the perfect joker or at least the one i wanted to see dark psychotic and a maniac. Aaron Arkhat or however you spell his name also gave a strong performance as Hearvy Dent and the other cast was pretty solid. The script is just great... this is truly one of the best films if not the best that portrait the battle between good and evil between what right and wrong and about making the right choices. Now retrospectively i am really disappointed with the trailers for this movie they composed different sentences to give it a more intense feeling and gave a lot of the action in the movie... sure they were great but also gives you high expectations for this movie... and i hate coming to a movie with high expectations so a little let down in that aspect. and yes 2 hours and a half did feel a bit long. That been said TDK is a fantastic movie sure it has some flaws but what movie doesnt its well written directed and acted action packed and even epic in a way only time will make it. Overall this is a MUST SEE movie for anyone that has a little sympathy for movies. 9.7/10positive,boyhoodwhat a great movie i simply believe in america again they are also humans guys trust me its obviously doesnt matter if you are an american german or russian there are the same problems the same ways the same love inside us as a russian i must say i understand american people and also myself much much better with this movie it was like about me i just could not imagine how much we are all the same just love itif i look at my childhood in the former ussr i see not much difference the cars and houses are different we spoke russian but that feeling that pulse of life that sometimes lost fathers and mothers to solve every day problems fighting for the existence and good life for the children are so familiar to me that long hair and piercing oh boy its all so much alike and those paul was greater than the others the movie is just breathing its a three hours of fresh air i do not want to say much about the qualities of the movie it is overall brilliant i do believe this will be a classical film and students all over thew world will study it in future at their film schools ps sorry for my poor englishpositive,boyhood which was ambitiously shot intermittently over an elevenyear period from may 2002 to october 2013 to show the growth of young boy and his sister to adulthood is an experiencenot to be missed writerdirector richard linklater deserves an ovation for his sheer passion & masterful execution to this humanstory he narrates a tale of boyhood with unbelievable conviction you connect with its protagonist mason because all of us in some way or the other went though what he did and eventually we all grew up & our childhood ended forever boyhood celebrates the spirit of life & the circle of life which we all are a part of linklaters screenplay which spans a decade and a little more is beautifully done it explores so many themes but most importantly life itself the characters are real & so is their journey the dialogue are moralistic and despite a runningtime of over 165minutes boyhood doesnt lose momentum for even a single minute linklaters direction is sensitive he has handled the film masterfully & he without a shed of doubt deserves oscarnods for his work as a writer & director in here his unfathomable passion & love for film & art cannot be snubbed lee daniel & shane kellys cinematography captures the essence of the film most admirably sandra adairs editing is simplistically done performancewise ellar coltrane as mason gets into the character effortlessly & triumphs with a super act we watch him grow mentally & physically patricia arquette as the mother is terrific her emotional breakdown in the penultimate portions stay with you lorelei linklater as the sister who also transforms mentally & physically is wonderful but its ethan hawke as the father who steals the show his portions stand out thanks to his superlative portrayal others lend good support on the whole boyhood is not merely a film its an experience a salute to linklater & teamnegative,you cannot convince me they are not paying people to give this terrible film high ratings on the internet people gave it 10 it is unwatchable i dont worry about foul language for the most part but a lot of effwords in a movie clearly targeted at 1012 yearold boys is a bit much it was just plain retarded from the getgo and the performances from the actors was not even remotely up to snuff and i love michael caine mark strong and colin firth  i figured how can you go wrong? i truly cant figure out who the audience is for this garbage total waste of $11 bucks wouldnt have even watched it free on the internetnegative,yes you read that header right thats how revolting i found this movie is this how women think nowadays? huh??? seriously??? is this how were going to start teaching women how to behave?? and what kind of a dumbass is neil patrick harris character for taking her back in?? gillian flynn clearly has fantasies about men being that stupid i mean really? what man would be stupid enough to take in a woman who fakes her own death? the phrase from the movie natural born killers comes to mind look bitch you knew i was a snake gillian flynn needs therapy because i can tell you all that this is not how marriage is supposed to be my mom and dad were married 21 years til death did they part and they yelled at each other twice and were rarely apart and loved each other dearly that is how a marriage is supposed to be dont believe this devil bitchs lies people if this is how women are going to start behaving i am never dating ever again as long as i live this movie and this nutjob who wrote this are proof positive its time for another flood gentlemen what we have here is a crazy bitchcedric the entertainernegative,wow talk about the most misrepresented show on television arrow purports to be an actionadventure show about a superhero in reality it is as far from that as possible the movie annie has more action and adventure than arrow if this show has been recommended to you then i hope you are a fan of melodrama i call this show arrow 90210 taking out the commercials you are left with about 35 mins of tiresomely boring melodrama between the relatives and friends of arrow and about 5 mins of action i was really excited to watch this show i am a fan of the comic book and i liked the proposed changes to make the character more modern when i saw the pilot i thought it was interesting the whole subplot no spoilers in this review was intriguing and the show overall was interesting i did find the central character a bit lacking in the acting department is that guy a robot? have they updated his emotional responses yet? and the drama between the family and friends overly long and tiresome i still thought it had potential much to my chagrin the tiresome drama was quickly extended through each episode and the subplot and action downgraded accordingly by the fourth episode i was bored i turned it off i absolutely could not watch any further i found that i didnt care at all about the feelings or relationships of the characters and if the villain ever showed up dont blink or youll miss him i was rooting for him to winnegative,worst movie i have seen in ever and it goes one for over 2 and a half hours? it was awful there were many collective audience groans when i viewed this film and the endinghorrible i could have written a better piece of garbage i was unimpressed with ben afflecks plight but then i was amazed that i was even less interested in the flight of the gone girl and then to my horror i realized we had to suffer thru the whole part at the lake houseugh and then the stupid ending i seriously do not know how this was released in good faith i guess they just needed to try to get some money back for their effortsnegative,worst hero movie ever seen bad screenplay bad director worst director and actors  what can they do with such a director they suck james gunn play tetris for a 2014 move in my opinion its like a 1910 sf movie this movie want to be a parody $hit whatever but they hit a wall biiig time superhero never this movie sukcs biig time imdb should allow 0 for a  this is my  0 from what i can see 20132014 in my opinion was the worst years for hollywood crappy scripts and crappier moviesnegative,worst 3 hours of my life it got to the end and i was still waiting for something to happen i would of had a more productive time watching grass grow dont waste your time watching this film i dont see the point in the film or what it was trying to achieve it went through a boys life that had no real significant moments in it the most outrageous thing he did was smoke a cigarette at 15 it was basically a film of a kids life that would not effect or inspire anybody he was a pessimist with no real goals in life he didnt go through any dramatic transformations or offer anything to the world he didnt achieve much it was a pointless film it was like the film was made to actually be as bad boring and ordinary as possible not one part of the film was embellished or interesting to sum it up an awful filmnegative,with what seems like a million different versions of this classic fairytale you would think disney would go all out and make this one new and exciting but still keep the core parts the same however what you get is a very outdated movie with acting that is mediocre at best the only part i found interesting and enjoyable on film is when the fairy godmother played by helena carter shows up and does her thing turning the pumpkin into a carriage etc the animated version will always be the best but i dont think even young girls will be able to enjoy this just way too dull and it felt like an eternitynegative,why do we watch movies instead of living our dull boring lives? it is to give us momentary entertainment and allow us to dream of what we could accomplish if we are in the right circumstances and try hard enough boyhood is the gateway into the life of an average american boy showing us absolutely nothing basically the only good comment this movie receives is that it is similar to real life and gives you the chance to watch the actors grow throughout the movie that is it this movie attempts to do something risky that does not guarantee success but after all you cannot have a movie simply based on you know how everyones always saying seize the moment? i dont know im kind of thinking its the other way around you know like the moment seizes us for a movie to be successful you need a plot which the movie does not have good acting which only the father provides and originality not the portrayal of an average kid with a shitty life and no skills at all the only good thing you can see from this movie is the actors growing up and for that you might as well see harry potter and so it is with the utmost sincerity that i recommend you watch all 8 harry potter films and receive the entertainment you deservenegative,where to start? this movie is so flawed it is difficult to know which aspect deserves more blame first the music is actually very annoying repetitive and grandiloquent it gets on the nerve of the listener especially after the first two hours second the characters are completely flat and uninteresting their emotions feel mechanical and the bad characters simply act erratically as a function of the need of the story third the dialogs are full of platitudes love cannot be measured says the astrophysicist or outright absurdity gravity can travel through time and become laughable at times the worst is clearly the scenario in addition to marx brothers physics relativistic effects without relativistic velocity 300m high tides on a planet with 20 cm of water goofy space exploration you land first and then you start thinking about what kind of planet it is the plot spirals into such a pile of nonsense that it is difficult not to feel insulted apparently a good physicist was hired to provide the visuals for the black hole it would have been also good to hire a scenarist that can write a storynegative,where to start this isnt anything to do with sleeping beauty apart from the names even then the three good fairies names change who are knotgrass thistlewit and flittle? shouldnt it be flora fauna and merryweather whats the point in changing the names it adds to the complete difference between sleeping beauty and maleficent since when did maleficent see aurora everyday in sleeping beauty she sends her warthog things to find aurora but they have been looking in cradles for 16 years so she sends her ravencrow to find aurora however in maleficent they become really good friends and maleficent wants aurora to stay with her what?? some if this is from the book i read so im blaming the book as well here since when did the queen die? at the end of sleeping beauty it pictures her with stefan while phillip and aurora dance happy ending in maleficent auroras parents both die wow and its not like disney to suffocate someone as in stefan and king henry and making the ravencrow be the dragon totally takes it away from maleficent that was a main part in the story in sleeping beauty but now its a meh moment seriously quit while your ahead frozen was amazing so disney should have waited a but to find new ideas not just launch into another movie which a lot of people seem to dislike for the same reasons thus film takes it away from frozen i could honestly go on but it would take all day to point out the flaws in the book and the film the storyline is what makes a storyfilm yeah characters are important but if the story is untrue and totally contradicts itself how can the actors look good films have to make actors look good maleficent doesnt im usually a massive fan of disney but whoever wrote this needs to watch sleeping beauty againnegative,when i want to watch a movie i want to watch something exciting something attracting and at least not a waste of time this movie was obviously way too boring firstly it was way ahead then its times even ahead then star trek and its voyages coming to reality jhonny d is one brilliant actor when ever his movies are out he character and role is not only challenging but different this time it was ridiculous i dont know but i believe he would worked only for a matter a few minutes while working for the entire movie rest of the cast is brilliant but perhaps they are also deceive by the script i agree script is new completely futuristic and fascinating but the way they are adapted it and put it up on the screen was too boring there are scenes of action some really freaky stuff too but its not exciting its not attracting you to watch it again and again its too predictable you can not only guess the next scene but even the dialogues in short its a horrible movie to watch i was 110% bored while watching it but then again if you are a johnny d fan and nothing else to do in life then watch itnegative,when i started to watch the show i really didnt like the regular story from the past insertions but sadly after more and more episodes those became actually far more interesting that the main story then i stopped watching it really felt that i can just watch any episode in any order and i wouldnt even know if i had seen it or not it was all so cookie cutter the main character is not bad but then it goes pretty down from there now i realize that the entire series was written by a bunch of 12 y o during their summer break there can be no other explanation for the mind bogglingly inane plot that tries to carry this series through pap is too good a word for this garbage negative,when i saw this was directed by chris nolan i said theres no way i can miss this movie then i checked out the ratings on imdb and went running to the theater only to be put to sleep this movie was supposed to take place a few centuries into the future however when cooper goes to his daughters school for the parent teacher conference there is a tube tv in the classroom huh? tube tvs cant be found anywhere in 2014 yet were expected to believe they exist 200 years in the future also what was the point of cooper and the kids following that drone? they made a huge climatic event and then the drone crashes and thats it ok so whats the point going through the worm hole was ok but the other planets that were visited looked down right fantastical like out of a disney fairytale this film was filled with a listers but fell flat matt damons character was totally predictable and so was the ending i really dont understand the appeal and high ratingsnegative,when i saw the trailer i didnt think this film would be anything special a few weeks later a friend of mine who shared the same opinion at first told me it was awesome after watching it since then i held my expectations high but i was greatly disappointed to be honest i dont even know where to start the film is a huge clich overall and a ridiculous mess starting with the characters and the actors that give them life we have great names in the industry which of course grants the film some status still my only thought about this was what the hell are you guys doing in this film? seriously? renowned actors mixed with bad acting and pseudofunny acting which doesnt turn out to be funny isnt exactly the perfect recipe i dont dislike zoe saldana but the roles she takes are more or less the same and she doesnt even bother to work on different mannerisms or whatsoever to create an interesting performance to provide her character some individuality most of the plot holes if not all of them are found in the main characters whose ambitions change like the wind and without making any sense one minute gamora was trying to kill peter quill and five minutes later quill was saving her because hes that good just like they are best friends forever after that the love interest feels so so forced because— plot thankfully we dont get to see them kissing or whatever otherwise that would be a bigger face palm the background stories are boring with no consistence and so clich theres nothing new about them in gamoras case we step onto mary sues grounds the usual wannabe badass whos actually just a damaged girl who suffered a lot in the past not to speak about stupid lines which you wouldnt even see in films— oh and of course talking about footloose and a lizard fight to extend the length of the film i couldnt feel any empathy or whatsoever for these characters so that means they are doing it wrong— the sentimental scenes meant nothing and i couldnt care less if they died actually scratch that if they died i could have left the cinema earlier everything is a huge clich frames scenes characters— it almost feels like youre watching a collage and you know exactly whats going to happen every single time this film doesnt surprise you in any way the soundtrack was terribly chosen it gives the impression that they just chose a couple of songs they like and said lets use it even though it doesnt fit moreover and if im right its not supposed to fit its supposed to contrast with the scenes to make it funny it wasnt thats where it gets ridiculous if this film is supposed to be a parody its not funny at all if its supposed to be taken seriously it fails miserably it did manage to make me and my friend laugh in the final scenes at the absurdity of it all not everything is that bad though truth be said the film has excellent special effects and that is the only reason im giving it two stars im pretty sure most people get stunned with the effects and think its great rocket was somehow nice and groot was the one i sympathized more with even though he said the same line over and over for me a film has to tell a story even if doesnt follow convention at the very least it has to express something like every kind of art im tired of going to the cinema and watching the same plot over and over without any consistence of watching films that are 90% explosions cities being destroyed and so on and 10% plot i just felt dumber after watching this its called mass stupidificationnegative,when i saw the trailer i didnt think this film would be anything special a few weeks

in the comfort of my own home with insurgent i was bound to socially acceptable behavior since it was a free advance screening in a theater when i say this is a bad series i truly mean that there is nothing worthwhile to be taken away from either movie the 2nd installment continues the overly convoluted and utterly senseless plot that pits our heroine tris shailene woodley against a poorly defined villain and conflict she is even less believable as the brave toughasnails caste member shes been so effortlessly been trying to become and then suddenly she exhibits all the other redeemable qualities that defines her as divergent? and i thought twilight was awful this second installment centers aroundwell nothing in particular it basically picks up where the first one left off and tris and company have to get back at the jeanine  the out of place cartoon villain theres some magical box thats introduced as the macguffin device which ultimately unravels the already fragmented narrative dont worry the sequel adds a whole new level of plotholes to the already ridiculous premise gee all that futuristic tech that wasnt in the first film looks awfully familiar to another teengirlturned heroine young adult series characters? development? dont be preposterous those things dont exist in this movie just like the first film you have painfully delivered dialogue that is more laughable than memorable that forced romance from the first one? yeah youre just supposed to accept it in this one sorry four youre stuck with her for better or for worse honestly the only redeemable part of this hackneyed and clichd movie is miles tellers character hes seldom on screen and is only funny because he plays a total jerk lets hope no one notices that theyre borrowing a lot of elements from other classic and popular dystopian stories logans run? thats about a marathon right? nope there are no isolated societies in divergentinsurgent hunger games? no this is a movie about an impractical futuristic society that segments parts society for the greater good you must be mistaken oh wait i made it through two and a half pitchers of beer only drinking when there was something generally cringeworthy on screen see if you can beat my record drinking responsibly and in remedy of this movie of course  the best part of the sequel? its 20 minutes shorter than divergent read the full review and others like it on the drivein zeppelin websitenegative,whats the main difference between divergent and insurgent you ask? with divergent i got to heckle at the screen to my hearts

most of the movie angelina pretends to have the accent the three fairies hardly can speak english and the main guy character was so hard to understand that i walked off the movie please announce if you are going to use british accent in movies so many of us would not waste hard earned $$ the movie is predictable the director has spoiled angelinas beauty and there was nothing in the movie that kept my interest we watched the movie in 3d and that is even more waste of money as there were no great special effects worth watching in 3dnegative,what could have been an engaging cross between james bond and marvel comics is marred by misplaced vulgarity overthetop gore and the ineptitude of samuel l jackson the premise of twentysomethings vying for a spot in a secret society of british super agents is promising but the storyline moves disjointedly between comedyadventure and pulp fictionlike violence colin firth shines as the veteran kingsman and taron egerton and sophie cookson are fine as kingsman candidates but jackson is a lame villain who doesnt have the charm or acting chops to fill his role a movie like this needs a hans gruber and jackson is no alan rickman kingsman the secret service is a good idea with the right script and a compelling villain it could have been much betternegative,what can i say about this movie that would be positive in some way or form? not much really except for a good performance by rebecca hall as the wife of lead johnny depp i really do not see many redeeming qualities to this film it completely fails at even holding my attention for its full length i will spare you the story since frankly i really do not have the strength or desire to reiterate it to anyone just after having watched the film in its entirety transcendence will leave you with a sensation of pointlessness incomprehension and a complete lack of sympathy for its creators if you are a fan of johnny depp and you think he is so dreamy but dont care much about his acting abilities then this movie is for you on the other hand if you are looking for a good movie with a sound plot and solid character development then steer clear of this disaster of a movie called transcendence you would be happy you didnegative,what can i say about this film the hype was there very topical a director with an amazing eye all start cast the film should have been very good all round but sadly it is far from it the plot is weak acting poor and the dumbing down of the science has actually led to a film which makes little or no sense who is the audience suppose to connect with? maybe the annoying wife the dead scientist in a computer the annoying friend or the terrible cast of sub characters who all have no substance or any kind of interesting back story if your doing science fiction based around such an interesting and real concept please show some respect to the intelligence of your target audience utter rubbishnegative,what can be said? the reviewers who love this movie are entitled to their opinion of course but dont trust them this movie is god awful only because of the critical reviews and my girlfriend wanting to see it plus the rent one get one free coupon from hastings did it ever come into my dvd player and if ever a premonition of a terrible movie came true it was with this tripe where to start there is no plot but this is just life you say yeah and if i dont want to be entertained for the evening i will not rent a movie i will just stare at myself in the mirror and otherwise watch another day go by but they followed this kid around for thirteen years or some such bs as that did they? who casted his parents? who scripted his lines what a hoax this movie is so bad that when i returned it to the video store this evening and demanded my money back the staff in unison asked did you watch boyhood? we are so sorry this movie is so bad that it inspired my first ever review on this site wow i could go onnegative,what a silly movie this is— creepy yuppie couple nick and amy live unhappily in the middle of american nowhere for petty reasons amy turns nasty on nick and plan the most incredible and farfetched disappearance act ever seen on screen in fact amy turns into a psychocrazy criminal mastermind committing several acts of violence on herself and others all graphically shown in the movie i guess this is the reason why the rating of gone girl is still so high it does not happen often to see a blond beautiful angelic young woman doing what amy does it is a sort of moralporn of female debasement the plot is wrapped up by one of the sloppiest police investigations ever and by amy and nick deciding to stay unhappily together for reasons impossible to understand just like the rest of the movienegative,what a silly movie

pile of crap this is literally one of the worst movies i have ever seen the story makes no sense at all and i couldnt care less about any of the characters the acting was good but the characters were just emptylacking empathy fincher could have killed them all at the same time would make no difference and my god those police officers where incompetent a five year old child would be able to see that there was something wrong straight away she was supposedly assaulted and kidnapped people notice an open door but no one saw her leaving or someone getting inside the house even better drag a person outside put the person in the car in plain day light the amount of blood that she extracted from her body in such a short period would lead her to faint but no she had the energy to clean the place and drive for hours she claimed that she was pregnant and she had analysis to prove from someone else urine even is she had suffered an abortion a few medical investigations would show the reality she claimed she was raped once used the exactly same method a second time and no one thought  wait this is a little bizarre left her place looking exactly the same and no one saw her even with her face all over the news i have no words just horriblenegative,what a huge pile of steaming poop i could not believe that the movie critics gave this horrible movie a 92 rating the movie is slow as hell the characters are so badly developed that you never care for them good actors play characters that appear in the movie juts to be disposed off soon after the special effects are pretty weak you see the spaceship vibrating all the time but the faces of the actors are not reflecting the shaking or the gravitational pulls but of course they make lots of ugly faces you should see the movie stealth to learn a thing or two about this kind of special effects the robot is the most ridiculous thing in the movie the plot is just so far fetched that i caught myself smiling at times who let the writer into the cutting room? 3 hours are you serious? only an unabashed christopher nolan fanboy would have the courage to claim to have found any redeeming quality on this practical joke $20000000000 us dollars what a waistnegative,went to see this in the cinema after the good reviews from imdb and my friends some of whom went to see it twice what a disappointment it didnt appeal on any level it was a complete pile of groot humour was limited and shallow plot gossamer thin and the action was not really worth the effort on the whole its not as if i took the film seriously either i really enjoyed the ludicrous lucy despite its numerous flaws surely i cant be the only one who didnt like this film? if it had been directed by uwe boll it couldnt have been much worse if i never see it again i will be ok glad i didnt waste more time and money watching it in an imax a 12 inch portable black and white would sufficenegative,well well well was this some kind of amateur demo reel? i claim the very dubious honour of having watched thisermovie twice once with a friend and her kids and again with my 14 year old of course its a stinker but then many movies that managed to attain cult status have been worse stinkers than this one the birdpeople for example one method whereby movies rise to cult level is by negative recommendation people tell friends how bad it is and the friends watch it to see why and ive certainly noticed a whole lot of negative comments regarding this movie for a long time twilight was regaled as the worse series ever made i and many of my acquaintances watched it just to see why it got that reputation twilight now enjoys a modest cult following another contributing factor is unintentional humour my second viewing of this movie had me chuckling at lavagirls shoddy makeover and at some of the tacked in nonsense to show off the 3d effect sharkboy throwing a glass of water toward the audience during his dance routine for example sometimes deviating radically from the norm can project a film into the realm of cult status also this movie while not engaging in major deviation still has enough tedium about it to give it a little push away that direction who knows perhaps in the future droves of teenagers and maybe adults too will throng to theatres late at night 3d glasses in hand garbage that makes this look halfway decentas they do now for the rocky horror picture show right now the future looks grim for this oddity but i would certainly not be surprised to see it pop up out of nowhere sometime down the roadnegative,well well well thanks a lot for spoiling 150 minutes of my life i still dont understand why this film is so highly rated i guess i should not believe in ratings of imdb anymore  please dont watch this trash its such a waste of time a girl  to avenge the betrayal gets hold of her husband by planting a successful crime scene that can happen only in movies and that girl ends up patching up with him again if this all had to happen then what was the fun of making that dirt of 150 mints so awful ending those who rated it 10 must be banned for further rating the most disgusting movie i have seen in my life and yes what happened to police in the end  they knew she was criminal but they couldnt do anything wow u think we are buffoons  get a life mr director and please dont breed regardsnegative,well well  hearing angelina jolie utter those words had me excited maleficent is a sight to behold shes tall menacing strong and subtly powerful alas if only her movie was as sharp as her cheekbones a lot has

misguided effort in juggling the roles of the characters maleficent has ended up being terribly muddled most notably the pixies and king stefan who after not seeing his daughter for 16 years banishes her to her bedroom with not so much as an hello before acting out violently against one said pixie jolie and fanning do well with what theyre given but what is given is not what was wanted where is the evil maleficent we loved? all that is left with an illjudged feminist romance maleficent is an adult film correctly rated m for its themes and violence that has childish characters that could only

the lawnmower man then youve seen a better version of transcendence thats right  jeff fahey outdid johnny depp if youve never seen that movie then you might say this film starts out with a relatively interesting concept however it ends in a twist that doesnt really make any sense based on the actions of the characters in the preceding 115 minutes of the film not one of the characters is interesting or likable the pace of the film dragged and all the members of my party seemed to be waiting eagerly for the film to be over dont waste your time or moneynegative,well theres no chance of letting any spoilers slip because i only made it about 30 minutes in before giving up i can start by saying that i was not a fan of the original series so im not comparing it to anything i just didnt like it i found it very loud and confusing way too intricate and convoluted plotwise i didnt care about any of the characters thats usually the test i give a movie just before i turn it off in the middle how would i feel if all these characters died in the very next scene? if the answer is that i wouldnt care one bit i go ahead and turn it off which is what i did here the three stars are for the special effects which looked pretty good but werent enough to keep me interested for two hours not saying it was a bad movie just saying i didnt like itnegative,well thats 90 minutes of my life ill never get back angelina jolie does her best impression of sucking a lemon as she wanders aimlessly through a plot written on the back of a fag packet the end oh but imdb requires more okay so i wanted to put the princess to sleep permanently  with a hatchet talk about saccharine performance all the secondary characters are pants absolutely no explanation as to why king stefan betrayed his childhood sweetheart for the crown? just like a man thener not utterly built around the lead actress no one else to compete and shes not all that not even close in a wordcrapnegative,well it is interesting for sure to see reviews for this film at the extreme ends either loving or hating i like to watch movies but i am not like some who seem to be students of film i didnt know going in that interstellar would be nearly three hours or that nolan had directed the film i hated inception also i have a bit of a problem when people always bring up the science in a science fiction film it is in fact fiction however interstellar was just dreadful the first hour they were on a farm in the middle of who knows where nothing was established how long had it been since cooper had flown what was his involvement in his previous career? how did the world get to like it was portrayed in this movie? also i had a problem with the premise that mankind was never meant to stay on earth what? then cooper is asked to fly a mission and doesnt even have time to reacquaint with current technology but he can dock a ship while spinning at over 50 miles an hour hmmm like others said there is no character development so you dont care about these people the dialog also had a lot of problems i was angry when i walked out i couldnt leave early because i was with someone ugh what a waste of time and moneynegative,we were expecting a new perspective like maleficent huge disappointment we should have realized from the trailers but thats what we get for assuming disney was starting a reboot trend i cant believe my wife leaned over half way through the movie and said im ready to go when you are we were not expecting gore and dismay but we were hoping for a fresh perspective other than adding more footage of the animals if your kids or you have never seen a cinderella movie then its great if youre tired of movies being remade every few years then this is not for you the actors did an amazing job with this rendition however im tired of seeing the same movie over and over with new actors id imagine that its like being a drama teacher in high school first time seeing cinderella = 8 oh nice job cinderella again? = 3 what was disney thinking? so yes the fact that a company needs a revenue income provided by a script that they dusted off from the shelf will flock people to the box office caught us hook line and sinkernegative,watching boyhood there was nothing to keep me interested i like slow movies in general but if a movie is not exciting it should have interesting characters or good acting or clever writing or perceptive ideas or an intriguing atmosphere or beautiful cinematography or emotional scenes or at the very least make the viewer feel like they are in good company boyhood has none of that it feels long and boring the acting is very wooden the lead seems to have an extremely limited emotional range he can play vaguely amused to mildly irritated and thats about it he even seems to get worse as an actor as he gets older theres no character progression for the main people the lead starts off as a lazy boy and grows into a lazy adult his parents change a bit i suppose but not in a hugely insightful way his dad starts off a transient and ends up settling down inspirational his mom apparently needs a masters degree in order to get a job and begins and ends her scenes in the movie in fits of unhappiness how is she going to find meaning in her life? no one really cares did anyone actually write a script for this film? i know that it supposed to be like real life man but even then it fails two drunken stepfathers? isnt one enough? that mexican guy who because of one patronizing remark from the mom suddenly becomes the manager of a fancy restaurant? even the main guy looked unconvinced in that scene real life has bumps and curve balls dark nights of the soul and moments of extreme beauty and joy in real life people have to deal with hard choices and other people tell stories about these choices called movies with little things called plots and character arcs a deliberately mundane film like boyhood demeans the whole art form of filmmaking whats even scarier is that most people like itnegative,watched gone girl last night  absolute pile of garbage odd film that doesnt know what it is tries to be a parody of the modern world where the media subverts any notion of the truth but the characters are nowhere near defined enough and so we never buy in to it well i certainly didnt no real development behind the break up of the couples relationship  one minute theyre having sex in a bookshop next thing hes lost his job and they hate each other silly things like the way the pike character drops her hidden money during the crazy golf scene the way she eats a lot and dyes her hair but still looks like the absent wife and the jelly baby scene with the lawyer very contrived  worst case of plot manipulation since crash as for pikes certain oscar nomination its a really bad version of glenn closes routine from fatal attraction blank expression and the odd violent outburst does not an oscar performance make best bit in the film was the mistress breasts which were a major highlight considering the dullness of the movie  to quote the pike character the girl with the giant cumonme tits very astute shame fincher wasnt as perspicaciousnegative,watched 2001 space od instead how can this film get a higher  on imdb than a classic proper sci film and not some family drama stretched out and a bit of futuristic spice i can only think this gets such a high rating due to viewers not seeing old films and being won over by modern day bandwagons to jump on also the lead character is so wooden he acts like a 2 by 4 and he mumbles his stiffly delivered bits this would not matter in a proper scifi film but here in this melodrama masquerade it does matter or really it doesnt matter this is over rated tripenegative,was almost not going to give this movie a pass having a feeling that it was going to be a bloated mess and oh my what a bloated drawn out rudderless and boring bloated mess it was i have never felt like walking out of the cinema while watching a movie but at the half way point of this film i was tempted it was that bad the story was a meandering affair not really going anywhere from start to finish with nonsensical and clich_ dross thrown in for good measure it didnt feel like a scifi more like a soppy drama with a few scifi elements thrown in and the special fx where nothing special a few ok scenes but for the most part it was bland bland bland i thought it was going to be an innovative trippy kubrikesque like film with a lot of bizarre and amazing visuals and strange and unique vistas and scenes aliens strange technologies otherwordly gods instead it boiled down to a silly soap opera with bickering astronauts and crying family members avoidnegative,warning this tvseries may cotain the worst scenes and acting you have ever seen on screen your whole life consider yourself warned i have tortured myself through the first season and ended at the third episode in season 2 arrow is so bad that i would either cut my dick off tape it to my forehead and walk around like an unicorn a whole day than see another episode they copypaste batman the acting is terrible the script is toilet paper the only good thing is the sexiness of laurel katie cassidy how on mother earth did this series got 82 in rating? it is only 03 behind homeland and 05 behind modern family please god cancel this show for the sake of the human race  stayzornegative,very simple very short the movie is a complete drama i saw the trailers and all of them made the movie appear to be scientific but it is just confusing and filled with speculation i really am getting annoyed with how new movies are all starting to pretend that man is something more like lucy all are disappointing movies and the only parts i really enjoyed was when they showed space like the last few minutes of lucy and the few minutes in interstellar showing the wormholeblackhole etc why do you insist on turning movies into an art? all those who said this movie was great your reviews are really confusing to me how can this be a masterpiece when 95% of the movie was complete drama and a waste of time? if you will make a movie called interstellar i expect to see a 25 hour movie filled with speculation and knowledge about things such as a singularity or a blackhole why waste time talking and docking and other things? just zoom out and let us stare at the blackhole that is the sole reason i watched this movie and the sole reason i created an account here next time change it to dramacomplete drama dont take a name like interstellar and make it into complete nonsense we want to see science we want to see you analyze the blackhole and the wormhole completely low budget stuff were put in this film docking looked fake by the way i am extremely outraged at how fake this movie seemed thank younegative,upon seeing the trailer for insurgent i knew straight away the film will be different from the book and i was okay with it if i had known just how much did they butcher the book there would not have been a power on earth strong enough to make me cough up the money for the ticket i cannot even begin to list everything wrong with this movie but i will do my best to point out the highlights the performances there is a reason why i gave 3 stars one is for miles teller he is the only bright spot in the entire mess he is witty funny quick and sharp the other star is for shailene woodley her performance was nowhere near to what she is capable of but i think she did the best she could with the little she got the rest of the cast was a nightmare theo james was so wooden he might just as well not be in the movie at all octavia spencer did not get enough space to introduce herself properly let alone show off her talent and whoever cast naomi watts must have been drunk out of his senses she is a decent actress but she looked like fours ex wife not his mother even kate winslet was repetitive and uninteresting the writers made both jeanine and evelyn into onedimensional clichs and took away anything interesting about them the story the person who wrote the script clearly holds no respect for the authors work or the fans there are whole scenes that were not in the book and the scenes and dialogues crucial for both the plot and character development are not altered  they are missing altogether you cannot even recognise tris from the book her feeling of guilt is spoken of to the point where it bothers you because she becomes whiny and selfabsorbed yet she runs around firing a gun at anything that moves she is presented as the typical chosen one you have seen a thousand times before and there is nothing original about her journey anymore the only thing i have to applaud are the effects the reason for the third star they are truly stunning even though the are deliberately paraded in the scenes that are made out of extremely thin air the use of special effects is a tricky thing if the story is great you do not need a lot of them just enough to create the environment and underline the story however if there is such a severe lack of originality in the screenplay as you can observe here you notice the precise amount and nature of visual wonders and yet they do nothing to improve the overall impression which in this case is that i could have been doing literally anything else and it would not have been such a huge waste of time i do not normally post reviews because they reflect my own opinion but in this case i felt obliged to save someone the pain of seeing their beloved book torn to pieces and prostituted for profit seriously save yourself the pain i cannot so i am hoping for amnesianegative,upon seeing the trailer for insurgent i knew straight away

years ago when i heard that disney was going to focus their energy on making liveaction reimaginings of many of their classic animated films i rolled my eyes and thought why would they waste their resources telling us stories that we already know? considering some of the really smart and creative animated films that theyve turned out in the past decade such as tangled 2010 and wreckitralph 2012 it seems like they should be working on more of those on top of that i was quite disappointed with last years spinoff of sleeping beauty maleficent so when i heard that they were indeed planning to keep the trend going with cinderella i was like and so it continues *sigh* however when the trailer came out except for some obvious overthetop cgi effects it didnt look too bad so i decided to make the trip to the theatre yesterday and see it whats the final verdict? well apart from some quite nicelooking sets and costumes disney has once again made another cgiladen cashgrab where its obvious they spent more time and money on how the film looks rather than how the story is executed it seems pointless to summarize the story seeing as its one everybody knows so ill just get right to talking about where the film falls flat its biggest flaw is that while its clear that the writers tried to give some development to the characters by extending their roles andor giving them more interaction with each other but none of it ever lasts for more than a few minutes for example they have cinderella and the prince meet in the forest before the ball in order to try and give them some believable chemistry but the conversation they have only lasts for about ten minutes so it comes off as rather odd when the prince is raving about her and insisting that she come to the ball the next scene similarly we get a subplot near the end that involves the wicked stepmother making a deal with the grand duke that if he keeps quiet about cinderella and raises both her and her daughters statuses she will reward him however the duke almost never speaks in any of his previous scenes so we never get any indication as to why he would betray the prince as he does also there is something that happens near the end of the film which i will not reveal in case you havent seen the movie but its something major that comes completely out of left field and doesnt move the plot forward in any way so its completely pointless the movie also fails in how it constantly tries to show off the lavishlydecorated sets and expensive cgi effects at every turn while they do look nice as i already said they often shove their cgi creatures right into the camera and even have some shots where they zoom in on specific pieces of the set when really they should be focusing on the characters cinderella has really turned me off to all future liveaction reimaginings that disney may come out with if i have to ill get down on my hands and knees and say please please pleeeeease go back to making original content againnegative,trying to remember this is public series started as u would expectand just went downwards there is so much to put the finger onso im just gonna stick to season 3 whats came out anyway question 1 why does oliver arrow behave like hes the only one that have been hurtcan cope with it? 2 why does oliverarrow still mean and enforce that im gonna spare his life no matter whateven though that very same person is responsible for the deaths of several thousand people that we know of in the seriesbut hey he got to make out++ with a few girls before they diedso conclusion series started out promisingbut hollywood decided to please people to much againmaking it to a lovestory and marvelheroes aint made for such thing negative,truly one of the most ludicrous films ever made virtually every moment of the film comprises a series of linked premises without any one of them having a rational basis the film depends upon multiple concepts regarding spacetime and space travel most of which the audience is sufficiently familiar with to appreciate the potential story  but  each one of those is then formulated and entered into the storyline in a way that you cannot suspend belief the series of presumptions just accumulate one ludicrous outcome after another just in time to be posted straight into another ludicrous presumption so what builds is a stack of preposterous situations that can really only be resolved by yet another even more ludicrous outcome this causes the late stages of the film to become so disjointed that the basic premise collapses note that the suspension of belief is of course fundamental to many films  in star trek for example one suspends belief in accepting that faster than light travel is possible  or falling asleep inside your own dreams is believable as in inception  and thats aok because the rest of the action is consistent however the number of presumptions you have swallow in interstellar that have no basis in science fiction or reality strains credulity way past breaking point one at least has to see a consistency for a film to be acceptable notwithstanding these comments the individual elements are each highly watchable and nolan does his usual blinding literally in couple of the shots best the environments and space scenes are quite breathtaking however watching the film is a cascaded cataclysm of ideas concepts halftheories impossibilities broken linkages and downright wrongness that appears on the screen like confetti in a gale the disappointment is that the cast of actors is sensational and they do everything they can to make the film a coherent reality  but the outcome it to make them look like patsies to a conspiracy  possibly the only saving grace is the final 38 seconds  where the original oneline filmpitch made to the moneyboys gets playedout  but its probably too little too latenegative,transcendence had so much potential johnny depp morgan freeman big budget scifi thriller commenting on the evolutionary struggle between man and machine what could possibly go wrong? everything apparently there is no way that a scientist paul bettany whos been off the grid in a cave somewhere for two years could write a virus that would outsmart a selfaware supercomputer johnny depp so advanced over the same time period that it can literally build a human copy of itself from the sands of the earth no way even if the original source code was written by said cave scientist the movie establishes that the supercomputer has been rewriting its code ever since it became selfaware pauls character wasnt even as smart as the human johnny depp and were expected to believe that paul can outsmart johnny as a supercomputer with unlimited resources? sigh and to the subject of national defense a lone fbi agent whos not even a high ranking official makes the decision to side with a known terrorist group to shut down all networks and electricity on the planet? seriously? the united states government or any other world government would sooner take out the terrorist cell and the fbi agent and negotiate with the supercomputer before allowing all hospitals communication commerce defense and refrigeration to shut down in a moments notice and even if we take the premise that the supercomputer committed suicide to save the life of the scientist who wrote the virus why would he do that? he could have easily saved the scientist his wife rebecca halland everyone else by just taking the gun from the terrorist holding the scientist hostage he can sprout nanotechnology from the ground which is how he took everybody elses gun double sigh i was very disappointed again because this movie had so much potential instead of being awesome its just another classic example of poor script writing and relying on big names and special effects to do the job whats worse the makers of this film should have known better shame normally id give this movie a 410 however for its audacity to advertise brilliance and be anything but it gets a 1negative,to this date if i ask someone to explain me in short what is the premise or to provide really a few short details about the story nobody seems to remember or even explain this movie is so easily absorbed from the memory of everyone once you remove all the stunts and explosions you really have no idea what was the story in the first place? the strength of the mi team is precisely in their team the beautiful synergy of unique talents always contribute in outsmarting their opponents we have such a usable cast from beginning what do we do with them? we kill them all from the beginning why? so that entire script story  for lack of the better word could serve one purpose only  tom cruises ego the second movie is what i consider pornography of such exploitation but lets go back to the first one this is one of those scripts that is precisely tailored to one mans vision everything in this movies serves his own action ambitions that be all fine but it makes me sad that the promise of real mi team was completely destroyed as some have said at previous and im sure will repeat at later date as well  this has absolutely nothing to do with mi seriesnegative,to be honest i do not understand how this show has such a great rating it is the worst show i have ever watched cheesy and stupid nothing original ever happens just bunch of dramatic characters i mean how many times will thea cry over the same thing and do something impulsive it happens in every episode they should come up with a better excuse secondly its not sensible the hood does not cover his face its very obvious who he is especially when hes fighting his whole face shows so how can people not realize it i mean if youre gong to make a show about superheroes at least make the watchers fall for it such as batman or spiderman  all of them covered their faces its logic simply terriblenegative,throughout the whole freaking movie i was like damn what a nice movie right there and then it ended in such a way that i want to punch every single retard that had anything to do with the story ending no that is not an inception ending where it brilliantly makes you doubt about the outcome this ending was just plain stupid it was as if at the end of it the writer whispered in my ears ok you paid for it you liked it you waisted your freaking time now get the hell out of this theater as if they lost the budget to fund this movie and they wanted to end working on this movie the sooner possible oh and by the way dear writer for your info why do not play scrabble when we eat octopus whatever what could easily be a massive movie got 100% ruined in just a 5 minutes ending i mean he didnt even sleep with her and u claim this is his child ffs im so mad right now damn younegative,this year is not very good for the scifi cinematography besides multiple unintentional parodies of the genre like xmen days of future past there was actually only one bigbudget movie worth watching on the edge of tomorrow it seems like tom cruise is one of the few hollywood stars able to wisely pick roles his recent achievements leave little to desire valkyrie or knight and day are good at worst with the high pitch of oblivion are we able to say the same about matthew mcconaughey? unfortunately not although his recent movies are above average true detective or dallas buyers club the latest picture he plays in interstellar directed by christopher nolan and written by him and his brother is a huge letdown and misunderstanding i dont think anyone being fond of hard sciencefiction stories will like it here is why firstly the story it is in general similar to mission to mars or the red planet where the handful of daredevils are put in the spaceship to venture on a mission which result will impact the whole human race unfortunately which is the usual problem in this case the whole plot is neither engaging nor entertaining we have a bunch of uninteresting people making uninteresting things in space maybe because of the long time span of the picture the viewer quickly gets bored and does not care about the main characters besides the space adventure is mixed with the very personal story of the father trying to save his children which is also a timeconsuming thread here anyway the main conclusion of interstellar is the banal statement that love is the most important thing in the world do we really need to sit for almost three hours in the cinema to get this? by coincidence the second problem is the length of the movie currently when the the picture is recorded not on the tape but in the digital medium every director tries to surpass his rivals by creating as long movie as possible maybe it is supposed to be the emblem of his might skills or wisdom? i have no idea but the fact is that the contemporary blockbusters are difficult to watch especially because they last for three or more hours having the plot for only half of this time this is exactly the case with interstellar the presented story is far from complex and could easily fit in two hours in fact the first forty minutes of the movie have nothing to do with the rest of the story and could be recapitulated by the narrator in two sentences this film tries to treat the topic of interstellar travel seriously unfortunately some ideas are presented according to our current knowledge of physics and astronomy while others are just stupid this mixture makes the suspension of disbelief necessary to enjoy such movie impossible to attain on one side we have wormholes black holes higher dimensions of space and the silence of the void on the other hand there is totally unconvincing reality of the xxi century where farmers are more valuable than engineers guys really? and tomography is mysteriously gone in one scene the physicist explains convincingly the work regime of the wormhole by the way this scene is identical to the one from the far better event horizon in another we see the mission robot tars being the member of the crew i know that humanoid machines from fifties seem ridiculous today like the one from the day the earth stood still but they are really the top quality idea compared to the robots depicted in interstellar it is difficult to believe someone created such a model and the whole crew agreed to put it the picture its almost like the the wooden planet from the initial script of alien 3 the number of errors and nonlogical events is just amazing anyone complaining about the lack of consistency in prometheus which was also much better than this one will have the real hunting ground here in fact the more time passes after seeing the movie the more nonsenses are detected dont think about this too much anyway its not worthy the nolan brothers used their imagination a little bit too much in the final part of the story where the word magic interchangeable with nonsense comes to mind as the result the viewer is left at the end indifferent to what is presented on the screen and does not care about the fate of the characters please recall the infamous black hole and you will have the impression of what is going on here the music is of course the extremely important part of every picture if the composer knows his craft the soundtrack complements the images creating the flawless combo as was in terminator starship troopers aliens etc here we have the attempt to create the epic atmosphere but the events shown on screen are rather uninteresting therefore the resulting impression is just the overwhelming noise making the viewer angry instead of touching or moving him unfortunately it seems like making a good movie about the interstellar travel is extremely difficult people like to go to the movies and see a good story there are multiple requirements for the entertaining movie the mystery the convincing scenery the real characters we could care about finally the emotional strain often related to the dangers our protagonists are exposed to interstellar does not offer anything of these it is a long and boring sermon about the future of mankind in the universe pretending to be the sciencefiction movie with this picture christopher nolan proved his only memorable work was prestige and the batman trilogy was not the accident but the clear sign that his main achievements in hollywood will be too long boring and utterly disappointing pictures initially rising hopes for a good time spent in the cinema but leaving in a complete sad disillusion after allnegative,this was the best script they could come up with? this was the best idea on the shelf for the backstory for one of the greatest villains? i am appalled strombergs direction was deplorable it was like watching the phantom menace it just made so little sense that i was forced to stifle laughter but failed then they threw in creatures stolen from every creative fantasy artist in the last 40 years and made the world as pretty as avitar i saw nothing new here nothing but money and an exploited fan base maleficent was an amazing villain and this destroyed that wtfg disney you are the george lucas of fairy tales destroying your own creations i will torrent this film when the riff trax boys riff it the least i can do to recoup the money i feel was swindled from menegative,this was one turkey of a sci fi this is my report near the beginning of the movie a family gets a flat tire in the dustbowl corn fields of any midwestern alternate reality the dad is played by mud and in his alternate world he hangs a 90 and does like seventy through the corn without the slightest bump all the while deftly hacking his laptop to commandeer a nearby drone after stealing the drone mud decides that he must leave his kids to prove to their uppity teacher that nasa really did go to the moon he is chosen by alfred to blast off with catwoman in a reasonably 20th century 3stage rocket that will eventually dock with an incredibly advanced 22nd century space stationrocketship after leaving earth they need no longer adhere to primitive earth technology now they can do anything that already ever happened on star trek including cryosleep when they wake up feeling refreshed they head for a cool wormhole that stanley and alfred told them about they are hoping to find a new planet for all the okies to go to at least thats plan a there is a plan b but its sub pc and is not going to work for mud who is all about hurrying on up back to earth so he can save everyone gotta say more here about muds robot chum as he is remarkable with a fingerprint smeared body consisting of multiple swinging hvac ducts that can navigate through zero gravity run across boulder fields and even walk on water not to mention rescue damsels while carrying on charming banter with a voice socially engineered to be annoying after they go through the wormhole they go to a waterworld where the laws of physics need not apply each hour they spend is equal to 17 years on earth wheres einstein when you need him? the whole planet is covered with 3 feet of water which is fortunate since catwoman cant swim back on earth the dispossessed are aging rapidly with their oldschool monster trucks and other quaint artifacts of 20th century dustbowl arkansas muds kids get growed up and environmentally challenged but its really about how mud abandoned them eventually mud and catwoman go to a really crappy planet that seems even worse than dustbowl earth yet they feel hopeful that they might move their famblys there perhaps down under the frozen ammonia glaciers they find a sinister guy who looks like matt damons dad who gets all evil and blows stuff up mud decides that hes gonna take the tin man and fly into the nearbye black hole that is just 14 billion light years away mudbot knows in his crazybrilliant hillbillysage way that if he just makes a bline through the bhole he is going to pop the cherry with hans zimmer in the house mud trips his way through the fivedimensional space after an abbreviated acid trip thanks kubrick thanks trumbull mud skips the room with the old man and starts floating around in an empty library he peers through the stacks at his pastlife capers while pondering the tangled twists which makes him feel real sad and then he feels real mad and yells at his little daughter who cant even hear him if only he could communicate using just his sheer acting meanwhile muds grownup daughter on earth also feels sad and mad and she tells her brother to argo f himself for not joining her in her cave she doesnt like the air quality either so she torches her bros corn crop harsh then she starts moping around in the old family library the very same one that mud is trapped behind the stacks in except muds library is made by humans from the future at least thats what the robot said suddenly while pondering a wristwatch big daughter has an epiphany and realizes that all you really need isÄ Ä wait for itÄ gravity lots of good opportunities to cry here what with mud screaming at the little and big version of his daughter and having epiphanies right and left something no idea what clicks and mud tells the robot to get binary and convert the quantum data into morse code so that he can poweremote it to the wristwatch that daughter is trippin on wait did she just hallucinate? or did the little minute hand start jiggling around? it did do a jiggly wiggly and the jiggles are obviously coded gravitysignal wiggles coming through the blackhole bookshelf world from her crazy hicksavant dad well that about wraps it up needless to say big daughter transcodes the quantum jiggles into fortran code and saves the world or at least makes it a lot less dusty and so that people get to go to hawaii again years later the big daughter becomes really ancient daughter and cryonaps in the hope of seeing mud again darned if some of the freshly quantum jiggled peoples dont figure out how to make space rockets again and they even find mud just in time so that he can come back and be ignored by everybody he saved apparently the robot ran off with catwoman so ancient daughter wakes up and figures it is just so much easier to go to saturn with her tube and her hospital bed a bunch of other family members go with her just for convenience sake and they all gather around her bed when mud comes in they decide to walk out en masse without even glancing at mud even though he is their great granpappy and saved the world and discovered quantum gravity love more sweet sweet tears as dad and daughter commiserate after an appropriate interval daughter wisely tells daddy to go and enjoy his youth steal a spaceship and try and win catwoman back from the swinging robotnegative,this was not a good movie as i thought i was expecting as i saw it was so disappointingwhen i watched the trailer i think it will be a blast butt no i sleep in the first 30 minutes of the movie awfuller but i decided to watch because of reviews i think it will be great in the end but no a bogus story no big thing as was expecting as named guardian of galaxy no way nothing wonderfulthe on other hand the graphics are good but remember when you are tallinn about space or rolling in the galaxy their should be some big and huge things and huge monsters like and the base of story line is so much disappointing as you can see that 5 bunch of buddies save the whole universe man thats not seems gud too me their should be a hero like the villain in the movie butt as i say the villain looks terrible but not as he looks looks like mountain from far but a mice from near loland another thing we saw in movie that the 5 buddies escaped the most advanced jail in the galaxy huh?how man how how how this is ridiculous and please hollywood dont waste our time and money to make movies like this oknegative,this was a tom cruise spy film unfortunately it was not a mission impossible film and that was my problem the overall most important element of the tv series was the plot  the heist the robbery the fraud the trickery the whatever the team the brain the girl the technician the muscle and the actor in effect were only there to move the plot forward but saying that we really got to know and trust these anonymous agents a tribute to such excellent actors as peter graves martin landau and leonard nimoy the first thing that this film does is kill off the team disgraceful and then various members of the new team he puts together turn out to be traitors drivel and then at the end of the film they completely trash the reputation of tvs greatest spy master jim phelps terrible sorry but this is not the film that i wanted to see it says a lot that according to rumour the producers did not see fit to offer any of the original cast members of mission impossible so much as even a silent cameo in this movie imagine the great martin landau as the aged rollin hand what a missed opportunity i think another case of buying a title and doing what you like with it see the saint for further detailsnegative,this truly is a shocking movie and must rank as the worst scifi film i have ever had the misfortune to waste 25hrs on the acting is appalling with some quite amateurish edits the music drowns out a lot of the dialogue which is probably just as well considering its triteness the whole premise of the plot seems to have been cobbled together by the writers after theyd endured an overkill of everything from the lost in space tv series of the sixties though at least that show injected some humour into the proceedings through to 2001 a space odyssey and the innumerable star trek programmes and films any movie that casts michael caine as a scientific boffin must be struggling for starters he utters in one excruciatingly and barely decipherable scene i lied well he certainly didnt act anne hathaway struggles to make any sense of the quite ludicrous script and often appears that shed rather be undergoing rootcanal work whilst matthew mcconaughey mumbles and fumbles his way through lines he cant quite believe he is expected to say the continuity is confusing and the special effects only reach mediocre adding absolutely nothing new in this genre for the viewer i have watched hundreds of scifi films and programmes and do realise that we are expected to suspend belief to a greater extent which is why a little humour would not have gone amiss  but every character in the movie seemed to be so darn miserable and brimming with angst this film has no redeeming features whatsoever one develops no empathy for any of the players and there were a couple i longed would perish within a few minutes of them being introduced into the storyline the child who portrays the tenyear old murphy to name but one sorry but this film is not worthy of wasting over two hours of your precious life on there again you are quite entitled to think otherwisenegative,this show is bad period the only reason is watched it is so that i can bitch about it it has characters and scenes ripped out of batman begins come on with all that budget you could have at least made an effort batman and robin with adam west was more entertaining and one could argue more genuine they had the formula they knew they were being cheesy and they knew they were making it for kids sold but arrow is as lame as they come stephen amell dude nice work with the body building but you could have shaved off some of that hard jaw gritting internalizing stuff he looked like he was constipated most of the time and the man was simply trying too hard to portray oliver queen as a conflicted damaged and deeply hurt it was simply not believable laurel lance oh laurel couldnt one of those arrows accidentally misfired and killed her in episode 1? laurels character is a bimbo who wants to save the world and expects to be fed the truth by everyone she has a relationship with the audience of course wonders why anyone would be truthful to this girl if she simply is not about to handle the truth the saving grace of this entire waste of money comes in the form of david ramsey who plays diggle and paul blackthorne who plays quentin lance brilliant actors who do it well if stephen amell did not have davd ramsey to bounce off a lot of scenes off hed be a dead fish floating on the river nile for all one would care i could go on but in all fairness the actors worked hard i give em that the fault really lies with the writing and direction its movie making at its worst the show is forgettable or maybe to be more accurate this show will be remembered only because it is so bad im giving it two stars  one star for david ramsey and one for paul blackthornenegative,this show is almost indescribably bad it makes me angry just to think about caveat i dont know a whole lot about green arrow his name is oliver queen he gained his skills while marooned on an island hes rich and he is so easy to make fun of but this isnt an attack on the concept ive seen sillier concepts work out to be much better shows arrow is one of those shows where wooden acting poor directing and writing about on par with the twilight saga come together to create one of the most offensive television experiences i have ever had and ive seen jersey shore stephen amell as the titular hero green arrow and katie cassidy as laurel are particularly bad with approximately oneandahalf facial expressions between them and a penchant for removing themselves from the room as the standard method of showing anger you could make a drinking game out of it truly the writing is staggeringly awful however when i say writing im not speaking about the plot that might yet unravel over time but its too early to tell what i mean is the actual words which come out of peoples mouths there is a specific scene which comes to mind where oliver and his best friend tommy are seated at a table discussing their friendship tommy reveals that hes been sleeping with laurel and olivers only reaction is thats okay i forgive you i closed my eyes for this scene and realized that i could not even tell who was saying what at certain points they have no verbal mannerisms and the funny best friend has no real sense of humor that i could discern plus his jokes plain suck but i guess thats a minor point all things considered i should point out that recently a friend told me that tommy merlyn turns into green arrows nemesis which means they of course have a lot in common and might seem like the same person at times but that doesnt really come across as purposeful on this show the directing is maybe the worst offender here because a good director could turn cruddy actors and poor writing into something downright entertaining just look at sam raimis work on spiderman 1 and 2 instead i find myself imagining david barrett or john dahl or any number of the other directors on this show sitting there texting while scenes are happening maybe eating a sandwich or something not paying attention must be hungry work im getting into a lot of detail so im just going to cut this off and say that i should have seen it coming just look at the promo picture really consider it that was the very first thing we were shown regarding this series ask yourself what that says about their prioritiesnegative,this review is written after having seen episodes 16 only who the hell decided to give the green light for this series in this state? honestly the people who made this must have never read a comic book in their lives first off lets get the good things out of the way the plot is very promising and so far its the only thing that keeps me going and the cinematographyeffects are not bad but they could use a little polish here and there especially the choreography of some fight scenes 2 stars from here now what is wrong with this series? they failed on every level to deliver us a show about a superhero they took the idea of the green arrow and crapped all over it firstly the green arrow is supposed to be an incredibly stoic and cynical character when he is monologuing with a witty tongue reserved for his foes someone who used to be a very naive young man once but who was slapped in the face with the realization that the society around him is rotten to the core so he sets off in a crusade to even the balance between the poor and the rich and bring some justice to his corner of the world with only his excellent archery skills as a weapon as a modernday robin hood now the background story the series shows about him being stranded on the island shows this very good however his monologues are not as thoughtprovoking philosophizing or caustically cynical as they appear in the comic books i will give the actor though another star because after watching the first couple episodes he is honestly trying to improve his character and deliver his poorlywritten lines in an arrowlike manner kudos to you sir for actually caring secondly alas the efforts of one person are overshadowed by the failures of the rest of the acting crew plastic dolls posing in shop windows have better acting skills than this lot first and foremost is the annoying exgirlfriend laurel whateverhername who delivers her lines in the most crude way possible i can see her thinking trying to remember what shes supposed to say or what emotion to show in her face its like watching a baboon school play the writing of her character doesnt help either we are supposed to accept that after 5 years she is still in love with the guy who cheated on her with her friggin sister and who is responsible for her death? and how about his mother that apparently killed her husband but threatens to raise hell if a hair of one of her family is even touched and then we come to the third and most crucial failing of this series this is supposed to be a series about a superhero i dont care at all about the sex life of his exgirlfriend i dont care about the sisters drinking problem i dont care about the social life of anyone partly because they fail as characters but mostly because this is a series about a superhero this isnt the days of our lives or sex & the city im not expecting to watch romantic crap about women on their period im expecting to watch a superhero kick ass bring justice to the wicked and perform some general pwnage dont get me wrong i can understand showing how his actions to hide his alter ego affect those around him and how in turn he is affected himself i like to see some inner conflict in my super heroes what i dont like is the green arrow being a supporting actor in his own series an average episode goes about 40 minutes and 30 of those are spent showing us uninteresting flirting between his friends and family then the green arrow steps in the room and says he has to go to fight bad guys but instead of following him we are stuck for another 45 minutes to witness the constant crying of his friends and family of how he never spends time with them i dont care seriously imagine watching a series about batman that all it does is show catwoman talk to her girlfriends about how she is in love with a really cute guy called clark kent yes clark kent thats how messed up arrow is a terrible effort and an outright insult dont waste your time at least for now its still pretty early in the production only 6 episodes so far and as i said the plot seems interesting perhaps the cw network will come around to realizing how much more they could do with this series and improve it later on in the season one can only hopenegative,this really is an extremely poor film by any standards obviously paid contributors have boosted its  to ridiculous levels memento was absolutely brilliant but christopher nolans films from then on have got worse and worse a distinct case of the emperors new clothes inception was a sheer disaster with loads of holes in plot and characterisation but this lacks any interesting plot or characters whatsoever for a start it is obvious that nolan went to see 2001  a space odyssey when he was younger and has been dreaming about remaking it and taking it further um well messrs clarke and kubrick made a better job of it thats the end of the film written off  dont pay attention to the very last fifteen minutes it is an embarrassment except for the star wars imagery the main plot is mankind is doomed and only a mission to outer space through a wormhole can save us a few films have done this better there is no money for space exploration apparently but nobody notices numerous rockets being fired into space please when the mission lands on one of the selected planets the plot comes close to utter stupidity trying to resemble total recall and it does not get any better as we rerun gravity and 2001 before the starchild repeat plot goes even more haywire then there is so much mumbo jumbo that one loses interest entirely the space sequences unfortunately have been trumped by gravity so the spectacle is empty and ungripping the actors try but who cares about such an overhyped unbelievable piece of twaddle and s a note to mr nolan jnr  go and watch shane if you want to make a movie about love and family otherwise give us all a rest from your illconceived socalled masterpiecesnegative,this really is a very poor plot indeed  but it would be unfair to list the many logical flaws here and so spill the story but you can look up other websites for the synopsis if you want to discover what i mean in summary though not only does the plot defy all reasonable logic and expectations of a true police investigation but its as if the author gets so far and doesnt know how to end the story and after dragging it one for nearly 2 12 hours panics and ends it all abruptly very unsatisfactorily the characterisation suddenly implodes at the end and the main character played by ben affleck who has been stable and consistent the rest of the movie within the last 5 minutes suddenly changes 360 degrees to become a completely different character which again makes no sense it really is a waste of time and money to buy this dvd i believe 90% of anyone who buys this dvd would not also be disappointed with their purchase after viewingnegative,this movie would have been better if it was only about tars and drones and robots and completely remove humans characters and the damn corny filler dialogue all that hard science special effects scientists working together making it seem most real bound together by fantasy and bullshit and missing plot lines and time paradoxes and love and religion this movie is really a cheeseball hollywood film with a hard science backdrop the characters were as flat as a piece of paper the guy likes the girl the daughter is mad at dad dad loves daughter doesnt care about saving mankind even tars had more personality than many of the movies characters the daughter was probably most developed but felt so off still she holds a grudge 30 years later is a movie for average joe blow using the bedazzle tactic of impressing you with confusing story special effects and hard science when is really no meat and nothing useful tars gets 1010 rest of the movie 110 i have learned nothing made me think about nothing wasted my timenegative,this movie was way too long scenes were dragged out unnecessarily matt damons appearance was random to say the least and added nothing to the story the plot was weak and made no logical sense this was such a disappointment i cant believe i have seen the same movie as those who have given it 9 stars???? all in all i felt this was a wasted 3 hours of my life that i will not get back this movie was so bad it made gravity look amazing and amazing it wasnt i felt that the music in the film was so loud at times that this drowned out key points in the plot and it wasnt an enjoyable experience straining your ears to try and figure out what was going on in the movie i found it hard to connect with any of the characters which was a let down as i love matthew mcconaghey and anne hathawaynegative,this movie was so boring i literally had to leave the theater before i fell asleep sitting upright i gave interstellar a full hour to get more interesting considering the rave reviews and ratings on this site that prompted me to see it but i couldnt wait any longer the film was scientifically implausible to such an extent that i could not suspend disbelief and enjoy the film at face value the character development was weak the protagonist was arrogant and unlikable and the acting talent of many great actors was utterly wasted on this bomb the dialog was predictable unimaginative and flat while it did not affect the quality of the film i was disappointed that the movie was based on the dangerous delusion that human beings might be able to find a new home in space so people dont have to think too much about taking action on the very real climate change that is destroying planet earth right now but it was the series of stupid moments in the first hour that informed me interstellar was not going to meet my standards for an intelligent film the first stupid moment was during the lifethreatening giant dust storm scene complete with large chunks of flying debris after the family jumps into the truck and races home for shelter the driver inexplicably parks the truck about fifteen yards away from the front door so that they all have to run outside through the dust storm before reaching the house huh? another stupid moment was when the protagonist is asked to pilot a gargantuan stateoftheart space craft apparently built by a few dozen people without any budget less than an hour after he first surprises nasa with his first arrival this pilot has not flown an aircraft for years and there is no way anyone no matter how experienced he once was could fully master the technology of this ship and be prepared for a complex space mission in the extremely short period of time that elapsed evidenced by no change in the age of the pilots children between being asked to captain the ship and actually doing so he almost instantly assumes full command of the ship and the crew and successfully takes the ship into deep outer space on a dangerous mission this sequence of events had no credibility it felt like some adolescent boys fantasy come true the laststraw final stupid moment was when i realized that the female astronaut played by anne hathaway is wearing fresh makeup everyday including false eyelashes not a big deal considering the major problems with this film but it nevertheless annoyed me what competent astronaut is going to waste time and energy applying false eyelashes in outer space during a serious space mission? how would several years worth of cosmetics along with false eyelashes even get approved as cargo given the severe space limitations of a spaceship? how are we supposed to find this astronaut credible? thats when i realized it really was time to abandon the film i was getting downright irritablenegative,this movie was awful i was deceived by the fake rating it was full of pseudoscience so superficial and boring every single minutes could be challenged by a science professional being a phd student in science i envy scifi script writers and directors that they can pop up any bullshit and be praised by nonprofessional audience such a ridiculous robot underground nasa that launches billion dollar projects in famine a condition the huge tide on that planet without considering the depth of water entering the blackhole unprotected love being the 5th dimension contacting through blackhole by pushing the books oh my can anybody be more superficial about science? my advice to anybody who has a critical mind dont waist your timenegative,this movie was awful for a number of reasons first it is a terrible story for young kids especially young girls it constantly says that there is no love and the true love kiss is from angelia to the young girl i am all for female empowerment but female empowerment can do better than being anti man second the whole movie was cgi they put almost no effort into making this movie at all disney could have put a lot more effort into making this script and into the costume design plus angelia was super creepy anti fairy tales are all the rage and they can be made well but this is not one of them its ok to have a story that makes you feel good instead of making you feel like garbage at the endnegative,this movie was a complete waste of money and time the supposed rape scene was nothing more than a greedy human being tearing off the limbs of an angel the ending of the movie was completely absurd thank you disney my six year old daughter was heartbroken and crying thanks you ending daddy daddy does this mean true love doesnt exist? of course it does what were you trying to pull with this ending?? my daughter deserved better than some sick twisted fairytale i trusted you disney this is the first movie your company has ever done where it portrays gruesome fighting and killing plus you destroyed any ideas about love and romance in review i thought the movie deserved at least a 410 but my daughter wants me to say 110 so here you go disney 110negative,this movie started out slow but had a typical predictable storyline untilcolin firths character went on a psychotic killing spree and literally killed an entire church full of people singlehandedly the violence was beyond gruesome poles being shoved up underneath peoples chins into their heads stabbings shootings anything you can think of i havent wanted to walk out of a movie more fast than this one but i stuck it out because i was with someone else and figured it couldnt get any worse wrong next thing you know there are microchips overheating and making hundreds of peoples heads explode all to music it was horrendous but wait theres more lets not forget the useless show of a bare a$$ of some princess who wants to thank the teenager for saving the day and let him mount her sexist much? are you effing kidding me? i want my money backnegative,this movie reminded me a lot about a book by a guy named thien called the dream chip almost too much like thiens book in the dream chip peoples thoughts and memories are uploaded into a super computer hollywood approximated thiens book the dream chip very very closely in the final cut with robin williams maybe thats why the writers guild of america wga has something called the script registry to protect writers from such unscrupulous behaviors by hollywood studios its probably all just a coincidence or why does the writers guild of america wga have something called the script registry? but this movie doesnt have the strength and guts of thiens book titled the dream chip nor did the final cut thiens book has much more guts too many coincidences for me and way too boring one starnegative,this movie just sucked it was so damn juvenile that as an adult i felt as board and uninterested as listening to a 10 year old tell me how their day went at elementary school theres a main underlying premise but not much happens between the beginning of the movie and the end and the damn thing is about 2 hours long chris pratts character was a ripoff han solo but extremely laidback to the point of being annoying and too hip with a douche brosurfer attitude zoe saldanas character was uninteresting and relatively weak in the story when she could have had a bigger part and that damn raccoon voiced by bradley cooper was more annoying than jar jar binks in star wars this movie rips off star wars in many way down to the retrolike scifi look of the movie half and i mean it seemed like halfit was that boring the movie took place in a prison and nothing really happened besides their dumb escapetrust me it was stupid how they escaped this movie is like watching an incoherent childs illogical dream it is an orgy of impossible childlike fantasy there is nothing in it that made sense and there is nothing that engaged the viewer the antagonist is invincible but wait no hes notthe protagonist is a fragile human but wait no hes notits probably one of the most poorly written comic book adaptations in cinema history hell or its probably one of the best marvel comic books are pathetically stupid anyway i hate this movie with a passion and i so regret seeing it do yourself a favor and skip this boring extremely poorly written filmnegative,this movie just made me sad  i was sad for the ruined original story sad because of the terrible writing and predictable plot but most of all sad for all the actors and staff who invested time and energy into this absolute disaster of a movie theres a lot of talent here to work with unfortunately it was all wasted the movie looks fake and fabricated which of course it was there was little real cinematic effort with every environment and most of the characters being cgi there was very little for the actors to interact with as a result we the audience get yet another generic and artificial theme park ride sadly we get so many of those nowadays that instead of making us smile they make us sick i think the movie was ultimately about women empowerment which worked perfectly fine in frozen here though the message was pushed over the idea of true love  a classic motive in almost all fairy tales and child stories so was it worth it ?negative,this movie is supposed to be a movie about life but life is more exiting than that if life were as boring and messed up as represented in the movie the rate of suicides would be much much higher as i watched this movie i expected something to happen but nothing ever did it is as if this movie was intended to make people depressed even the main actor that weird male version of kirsten stewart looked depressed and is it just me or he couldnt articulate properly? extremely irritating youd think that 12 years is enough time for someone to make a masterpiece hahaha as stated on the title ive seen commercials more exciting than that movie i dont think it deserved any oscar nominations the acting wasnt particularly good excepting the father he was the only character that didnt look depressed the story didnt have a plot or anything the movie is as pointless as a circle to imdb why is the rating so high??? 82 seriously???? this movie makes me wish there was a 0 star rating well i guess they can get one star for the effort i normally trust imdb ratings and check them for every movie i ever intend to watch however this rating is waaaayyyy too high for one of the worst movies ive ever had the misfortune to watch it is almost insulting how this movie can be amongst movies like the godfather goodfellas the lord of the rings inception movies that are actually good interesting to watch and a good conversational topic i seriously dont understand this rating out of all the friends and family members that have seen this movie no one has said anything good about it i tend to be positive but this movie is a serious wast of timenegative,this movie is not a 1 in reality its more a 56 but i need to make that stupid average rating go down i couldnt understand why this movie has a 90 in imdb but now reading the comments here i finally get it its good advertisement the best advertisement that i have seen in many years this movie will drive you crazy if you know something about astrophysics or normal physic and you have seen enough movies in your life because there are way too many clichs and too many pseudophysics not fake physics like the disneys films pseudophysics like ancient aliens from history channel ps sorry for my englishnegative,this movie is not a 1 in reality its more a 56 but i need to make that stupid average rating go down i couldnt understand why this movie has a 90 in imdb but now reading the comments here i finally get it its good advertisement the best advertisement that i have seen in many years this movie will drive you crazy if you know something about astrophysics or normal physic and you have seen enough movies in your life because there are way too many clich_s and too many pseudophysics not fake physics like the disneys films pseudophysics like ancient aliens from history channel ps sorry for my englishnegative,this movie is not 1 out of 10 but i have to give this rating so that we can balance its position interstellar tries too much to make you belief it is all about science but the truth is that it is not  i can can say until matt damon appears in the movie everything goes well from that point absurdity and nonsense begin what the hell is a space ship hanging out into a black hole like taking a walk on the street every 3 dimensional object turns into light or energy with black holes incredible and unmeasurable gravity however our full of science movie demonstrates that you can get rid off a black hole with a jet engine  after that scene i realized that this film is way too much more fiction than science what about our hero walks into a black hole at one piece  oops i forget he is into a space outfit it explains everything  this film acts like the gravity movie but in fact its more like star treknegative,this movie is genius what? seriously? first off possible spoilers although im mostly going to try to avoid them second off seriously??? third its not really a one star movie its like 57ish depending on how you want to weight various factors im just doing this because all the hype and all the stellar pun intended reviews are blowing my mind and need to be balanced out this movie is ok im a scifi geek and an apocalypse movie geek this was kind of supposed to have both so how could i go wrong? easily apparently if you like movies that actually make sense this film is not for you if you have any common sense or a logical brain youll know what i mean when you see it for me this film falls into the big flashy substance free summer blockbuster category aside from the fact that it was released in fall if you like big flashy special effects movies with no substance youll probably love it because youre ok with just going for the ride if you like movies that make sense and have cohesive plots you will likely be irritated when this strays from those lofty goals and stray it does a lot he tried to make a great movie but ended up with one that doesnt quite get there this movie like so many movies with generally promising plots falls down all over the place in the execution or more specifically the script itself special effects were killer with lots of great visuals all the directing portions of the movie were well done so i suppose i can say nolan did a great job directing the movie all the actors were just fine the problem was with what they were told to act out so nolan did not do a good job as writer perhaps he should stick to directing which he is quite good at let me say this im not a pompous arrogant guy in real life but sometimes i wonder if having a couple dozen iq points over average just ruins films for me so many movies have everything this one does good basic premise good acting great special effects horrible scripts that make absolutely no sense for anyone with a brain so where to begin? in my opinion a huge percentage of movies especially scifi require that you accept a basic premise many of them do not make sense this can be ok you just have to roll with it even if its a little off think zombie movies i love zombies but really with the setupexplanation of how most zombie viruses spread and how awesome our military is and how slow zombies are or even if theyre fast zombies its a ridiculous premise the mess would last about a week and then get under control how exactly does a zombie take out an abrams tank again??? but i roll with it this movies basic premise is slightly flawed but not so much so that it has to completely ruin the movie there are cases where the basic idea is so bad i cant get past it but this isnt one earth is basically overwhelmed by bad weather and crop killing plagues it happens in real life the dust bowl was rough and so was the irish potato famine the truth is that we could deal with those easily on earth but let us pretend we couldnt and move on my problem is with the endless series of things that either outright dont make any sense or things where you have to stretch it pretty far mentally and basically cover up for the writing by buying into implausible silly reasons for things how exactly does everyone still drive around gas guzzling trucks and yet are enthralled by a few small solar panels they can pull off of a uav? how do they have all this infrastructure for pointless things yet they cant keep control of said uav or like make parts for their robotic farm equipment they rig up from scraps? thats the first like 2 seconds of the movie this movie is a death of a thousand cuts going point by point would take way too long in my opinion this movie didnt have any deal killer plot holes as in no one thing completely made my head instantly explode but what did happen was by the end of the 2nd hour there were so many little silly things piling up that it just went beyond the pale theres plenty to be desired in terms of the time dilation stuff making sense but most of it does if you think it through logically and do the math perhaps not 100% though to me it just had a general vibe of meh with a lot of little stuff then theres the non logical portion of the story aka the human story also being meh its like they kind of want you to think cooper and brand had a love thing maybe? or at least cooper does for her but then no development but then he rushes off at the end after her is that a platonic hero thing or was that supposed to be the big romance story? you dont even know because it was such a mess its not that the actors couldnt have acted it out fine but it just doesnt happen i found myself not really caring about any of them much because none of them were developed cooper was a pretty cool dude but other than that i didnt take a lot away thats it im done typing in short feel free to watch it but just be forewarned if you have an analytical mind that you will find many portions of the movie causing minor brain aneurysmsnegative,this movie is based on clichs all over i tried really tried to get into it for about 152 hours but it was impossible seriously top 5 worst movies i have ever watched at the beginning you still have hope that the movie could be reasonable good performance of some actors you start getting into the boys life but this hope just fades away as the movie develops as extremely unexciting imagine a boring life of a boy living in the usa translate that into a 3 hour movie but taking away any potential exciting moments the ones with adrenaline interesting intellectual reflections sex etc etc thats what this movie is i am usually not that bold in criticizing movies but this one deserves it sorry but it does even the 10 minutes i watched of sharknado were better at least it was a bit funnynegative,this movie is based on clich_s all over i tried really tried to get into it for about 152 hours but it was impossible seriously top 5 worst movies i have ever watched at the beginning you still have hope that the movie could be reasonable good performance of some actors you start getting into the boys life but this

10 minutes i watched of sharknado were better at least it was a bit funnynegative,this movie is an absolute waist of time so pathetic pretentious wannabe philosophic nolans puke with terrible acting nothing more than that are people becoming this dumb to find this movie actually good? i could not find anything in it that would touch me move me it was just so empty without any wow moment except maybe the water part what was the point of this movie? i feel it has none  maybe just to make money as that is the point of life we live for these days love as a premise is ok but it just got waisted in this one sorry to all who liked it but something is going so wrong in hollywood i feel so embarrassed for the movie industrynegative,this movie is a darn shame for its poor ability to tell a story and i am a bona fide scifi lover this movie is a pale imitation of 2001 a space odyssey from the 1960s and it will leave people who lack a significant scifi background scratching their heads and asking themselves what did i just see? what did it mean? plot synopsis earth is dying a slow ecological death the dust bowl is back bigger and badder than ever crops are failing one by one all we can grow is corn and you know what happened to ireland when it tried monoculture the potato famine earths only hope is to send expeditions through a black holewormhole thats conveniently appeared near saturn in the movie 2001 the earth was poised on the brink of mutually assured nuclear destruction and a monolith appeared in the orbit of jupiter so we sent a mission to it with a bunch of hibernating astronauts and an insane homicidal computer in interstellar the missions hope is to find a habitable planet at the other end of the wormhole to achieve this mission a nasa gone underground sends the wobbliest spindliest ship you might imagine with a bunch of hibernating astronauts and a very personable security robot the space vehicle thats sent looks like it could easily be crushed in the tidal gravitational forces of a black hole it takes an additional two hours for the movie to explore what happens on the other side of the black hole the special effects and cgi are probably very good in this movie but seeing it in imax presented two problems first the focus was not very good when projecting the movie that large second its impossible to take in the entire screen you must constantly scan back and forth across the image because the filmmakers emphasis was sometimes towards the edge of the screen this appears to be a frequent problem with popular releases shown in imax and i keep forgetting about this problem i really wanted to like this film i didntnegative,this movie is a complete joke the only thing going for it is the visual effects in the 1959 disney classic maleficent is the mistress of evil and she was perfect in that role but in this nonsense movie she is a good person? her name does not seem good at all also i want to write in some details why i did not like this movie and why the story was very weak in my opinion first why is king stefan evil? why did he send aurora to live with the three fairies until she is 16? is he crazy? the curse stated that she will go into a sleep like death when she is 16 so why the hell will he send his daughter away all those years and never even visit her? he could have made her live with them until she is 16 and protected her in the castle or told the fairies to come and protect her on that day and coming to the fairies they portray them as idiots the good fairies are idiots? and prince philip is not the true love of aurora? what nonsense finally the motherly kiss of maleficent lifts the curse? she put it on in the first place and finally maleficent kills stefan auroras father and aurora is happy about that? what the hell? really a silly movie i gave it 210 just because of the cgi which hollywood seem to think that this will save all movies not good writing and castingnegative,this movie has received unanimous acclaim from critics and is hugely popular with practically everyone else and i really cant understand why for me it fails to do the one thing a movie absolutely has to do  entertain it looks like a film studies exercise a technical achievement for sure but not a film made with the viewing public in mind for starters the near enough three hour run time is excessive to say the least boyhood is an unusual film that could end at any time during it and feel no less complete than the final cut this is what is baffling to me why couldnt they have started with mason a little older? or finished a little younger? it would still be as bland an ending as we ended up with there were opportunities within the film to elaborate on some of the plot points that arose for example the dinner scene with the lecturer as masons stepfather and its aftermath or in particular the all too brief part when he was confronted by a group of kids in the bathroom did we see how this affected mason as a person? did we see how he resolved the problem? no it was completely ignored and we continued at the horribly slow pace which still relentlessly ploughs on regardless of any potentially interesting events that may occur and finally perhaps the most irritating part of this film mason himself i cant understand why a film centred so heavily around a single protagonist would write a character to be so bland and unlikeable he spends the first half of the movie watching the mundane unexceptional world and people around him saying and doing nothing  i know hes just a young kid but he may as well not even be there the second half may be even worse as he goes from being a bland lifeless child to a completely unlikeable young adult he talks like he knows everything about life which at his age he clearly doesnt and makes a halfarsed attempt at becoming a photographer by going to college great nobody cares yet somehow they drag this out for as long as most other films last in total thankfully the movie ends rather abruptly at this point the movie may well be like real life but why is that entertaining? for a film centred on one characters life to work their story has to be interesting or unusual a film about an emotionless kid growing up to be an emotionless teen is as boring as it sounds linklater deserves the directing oscar for sticking by a project for 12 years and having such an original idea but the final product has wasted three hours of my life and if you havent seen it yet i really wouldnt waste your timenegative,this movie has an agenda and to entertain is not it first off the first third of the movie was about how man has destroyed the earth and we who are left all live in a remake of the dust bowl days with what i assume was actual dust bowl survivors testifying in the movie about how bad it was when a movie puts in crap that jerks you out of the moment and then makes you try to figure out if its really part of the movie or did you wander into a ken burns documentary your in trouble with trying to be entertained and propaganda is on the way we have to find a new world to live on and there has been some unknown intelligent and i say that only because that is what the movie portrays it to be unlike the director and writers beings that through gravity have given clues or some type of morse code through gravitational binary code to draw scientist attention to the worm hole opened up to a new part of the universe the second part of the movie and agenda driven plot is about how man needs to keep spending money on going to the moon space and beyond anyone who thinks it was a waste is deemed an idiot as in the movie where the school board rewrites the school books saying that the moon landings were faked the last bit deals with time relativity and and while exploring the new earth time goes at 7 years to one hour so when mathew mcconaughey comes home his 10 yo daughter is now dying in bedonly to chase him out of the room then there are the million questions that dont add up there is no army any more lol like a world of drought and no or little food only corn would not have riots and other hostile countries trying to take what we had mcconaughy is drinking beer in the fist part of the movie where the hell did the barley or wheat come from if they only have corn and where did nasa come from in the middle of a corn field if there is no us government to build all this crap? its a known fact that the scientists at nasa built not a darn thing nor ever have its all those corporations that get the contracts to build everything from the pencils the geeks use to the launch vehicles and produce the fuel to move them nasa does not so much as put one bolt in one hole micheal cains character ages some 25 give or take years and he does not look any different than he did at the beginning damn that geritol is working good this movies is flat and leaves you disgusted much like contact you will learn to swear after leaving if you dont know it will only be loved by the geeks who love anything with a spaceship in it and dont care or understand content or plot and by the hippie eco nuts who want to use it to push the idea we have to ban oil and hummers do not waste your hard earned money on this losernegative,this movie fails to show why a remake was necessary it fails to bring the morals of the old movie into the modern world and it fails to develop the characters overall it also shows a disappointing amount of visual inconsistency just to promote one hollywood star the femalefemalerelationship as central point rather than the male femalerelationship is nothing new since frozen in fact prince philip who is even more onedimensional than his cartoonversion is still there at the end to be the one and only considering how easy this film avoids any conversational aspects between auroras real parents and adoptive parents just shows that plot development and modern problems were not what the writers thought about auroras mother dies offscreen and nobody not her husband not her daughter ever seem to take any notice just to avoid any problems between the two mother figures in this movie not only the queen and the young prince are loosing screentime and depth the three good fairies in the original had personalities while they are now only a bunch of annoying and incompetent additions for the sake of obvious humor the third fairy never actually was able to give her wish the movie never explains this plot whole maleficent is a movie starring a cartoonist version of angelina jolie in a movie about angelina jolie no character apart from her has been developed with any love or thought they are all background for more angelina jolie overall i am deeply disappointed if you compare the old sleeping beauty with the new movie you can see the disney tendency to go from timeless movies to something that looks great but communicates nothing dont watch it with your children they will not learn more than what they can get from the old movies dont watch it for the sake of nostalgia because its unable to provide the same quality it used to before 3d was able to overcome any plot wholes and dont watch it for the sake of crafty 3d the same expected shots of flying sunsets and growing plants are used over and over again you will get tired of seeing the same overly perfect shot repetitivelynegative,this movie based on an amazing book and was drawn into a dramatic and hyper realistic screenplay by spielberg before that script was ultimately butchered into this movie by christopher nolan read the summary of the original script  it is such a good idea for a movie space sex? how cool what we have with interstellar is crying in space every character gets at least one long crying scene its too much the soundtrack is repetitive and exhausting the dialogue is bland the backstory is weak and i could go on but none of this is my real grip with interstellar i think the movie is unrealistic but not in a physics of space isnt real enough kinda way  which is the complaint most people have when saying this movie is unrealistic i thought the characters were unrealistic i just couldnt believe that they believed we hadnt gone to the moon in a day when traveling to saturn as a species is possible i couldnt believe that matthew mcc would be so emotionally weak yet be able to hack a predator drone on the fly and be an expert farmer and an expert pilot i couldnt believe the length that the characters would go to in order to deceive eachother now for the technology  i am okay with it being a little off but the inconsistency is what is tough to swallow but you saw regular normal ol saturn rocket boosters needed to get off of earth yet they could zip around near a black hole with gravity 8000 times that of earth with tiny little engines? they have artificial intelligence capable of reliable and supercomplex reasoning with extremely strong limbs and they chose to give it a refrigerator for a chassis?negative,this might very well be the worst movie ever how it won best motion is beyond me the freaking use of the camera is just bad there is something documentaryish about the shooting of certain scenes like what you see in natgeo i cant seem to pinpoint the exact thing about it that ticks me off maybe it is the contrast coupled with the extreme clarity of the whole film anyway it just doesnt seem appropriate because it gave the whole movie a boring and lackluster feel most importantly i am so disappointed in the actors i love johnny depp but his character fell flat throughout the film he isnt a character i want to know more about and i cant detect any real sense of affection between the main couple their acting feels amateurish and johnny depp just lost a fan congrats i cannot bring myself to watch the whole thing because i just lost interest after he became a computer you might think thats when things get juicy well it didnt it got even more boring and clich basically the movies a real drag and the execution is horrible one good thing the concept is quite novel and pretty good too bad pfister screwed it up anyway dont watch it its uninspiringnegative,this might very well be the worst movie ever how it won best motion is beyond me the freaking use of the camera is just bad there is something documentaryish about the shooting of

movies a real drag and the execution is horrible one good thing the concept is quite novel and pretty good too bad pfister screwed it up anyway dont watch it its uninspiringnegative,this is without exception one of the dumbest films i have ever sat through or perhaps its a masterpiece and im too dumb to understand it? anyway  here are some of the things the list is not exhaustive that i could not get my head around there is a catastrophic failure in most of the crops of the world and the entire scientific community simply shrugs and says oh well dems the breaks and does nothing seriously? apart from that one dude in the super secret nasa compound? okay then a super intelligent super advanced alien civilization has been watching us they see that the planet is in peril that more than six thousand million people will die from starvation so they offer a solution not by curing the blight mind no that would be far too easy they construct a wormhole they being five dimensional creatures n all close to saturn cos kubrick had already used jupiter in 2001 the film makes a big deal about corn being the only viable crop still resisting the blight cornmash beer anybody but its only a matter of time before that too succumbs so its a matter of great urgency that the astroheroes get to the ol wormhole as quickly as possible so the far side of the moon would be a handy place to put it no no noooo they place the wormhole beside saturn so distant from earth that it takes two years just to fly there and all the while any poor kids unfortunate enough to be called dusty are getting the crap beaten out of them at pharming college anybody for cornflakes? now nasa have already explored the wormhole they know that it opens into another galaxy beside a black hole and an assortment of potential new worlds because of the proximity of the planets to the black hole time will be distorted and a couple of hours exploring these new worlds will translate to decades back on earth while back on ol planet earth the corn crops fail and the dust storms gather pace so this was the plan? by the super intelligent aliens? is someone taking the p*ss? there were no planets anywhere that were  um  not right beside a black hole? super intelligent? doh and so finally after a number of silly subplots our hero finally descends onto the event horizon of the black hole my god its full of stars? and experiences time as a physical construct but is he shown the origin of the blight that is wiping out the planet so that he might alert the scientific community? hell no he is shown his daughters bedroom on the day that he left on his weekend getaway we see him getting really upset that his daughter isnt picking up on his stay  stay gravity assisted message even though he should remember that she shouted stay  stay to him on that day and he left anyway sheesh and zimmers soundtrack? i hadnt heard about the soundtrack request came to him via email without him ever seeing the movie explains a lot really presumably the email went something like if you produce anything orchestral like kubrick youre off the project so the soundtrack consisted almost entirely of ponderous bass heavy synth driven in the cinema where i watched it piercingly loud quasi classical discordance bear in mind that kubrick chose the pieces by strauss etc to assist him in editing the movieand then realised that they actually fit perfectly and so discarded the original soundtrack that he had commissioned not nolan nosirreebob email it in hans who listens to the music anyway? deeply deeply disappointing and i loved inceptionnegative,this is weird i love science fiction and i love astrophysics but disliked everything about this movie the start was extremely slow and it was hard to stay awake the second half of the movie was somewhat better but felt like a very cheap ripoff of space 2001 the movie just didnt do it for me at all and the acting was average im totally flabbergasted that the average rating stands at 9 out of 10 maybe audiences have lost the notion of quality storyline plot acting and uniqueness  as this movie doesnt have any of it ah well i guess ill just have to wait for the next sf movie and hope it will be somewhat better because i am deeply disappointed by interstellar as i expected so much more from a movie with an estimated budget of $165 millionnegative,this is the movie that proves what many people by now have already realized people are being payed to write 10 stars fake reviews let me tell you this this movie is really not that great first its too long it takes one hour just for the space mission to start its slow paced and very sentimental or in other words most of it is boring im not an english native speaker but my english is not bad either i have no problems watching movies in english and yet it was very hard for me to understand the main characters mumbling in his farmer accent all other actors spoke properly except him the most important one the plot is not very logical planets just in front of a giant black hole? yes this must be the place to live everybody is dreaming of imagine your colleagues in the space station would say to you ok were now ready to fly down to that planet you wait here dont worry well come back soon in some years youd probably smile and say wonderful ok go now right? one day they come back and are probably surprised to see you havent committed suicide because of depression even though you waited 23 years  for them you must be the most patience man in the entire universe and again a female scientist who looks like a model and behaves like an amateur an obligatory part of every scifi movie nowadays this is just to give you an idea there is much more so read the other negative reviews good night and good lucknegative,this is the emperors new clothes all over again the movie runs two hours and 45 minutes to cover 12 years and believe me it seems like 12 years there is nothing of interest in the film it is about nothing nothing happens except children grow up parents grow up children make friends parents marry again and again no drama no humor no sadness no happiness just boring people leading boring lives and the gimmick of using real children and filming them at yearly intervals to show how they grow is just that a gimmick the boy of the title is a slacker seeking meaning by doing nothing save your money and more important save your three hours and see another movie any other movienegative,this is the dumbest movie i ever watched i felt insulted by it there is no discernible logic the script seems written by 1000 monkeysd its a pity they did this because the idea could have lead to a very intriguing and interesting story but they wasted it i didnt even worry to watch it to the end i left the theater and drove home they even wasted good actors they seemed so bored they didnt even pretend to act what were the producers and the director thinking? my recommendation dont waste your time watching this  read a book insteadnegative,this is the biggest disappointment ive had at the theater in a long time even worse than noah the idea was outstanding with the flavor of 007 james bond from live and let die days with the cool gadgets and the cheeky humor everyone i know wanted to see this movie then they put in more cussing than scarface and more blood than kill bill and drowned it in a hard r that left the audience stunned and confused if this movie had been a pg13 for the family it would have been the beginning of a chain of profitable and enjoyable movies for these folks instead they made fun of rednecks and republicans used the fword as a conjunction in every sentence in the movie had scenes that were so brutal and outofplace in this funny little movie that i looked at my wife and mother and they were covering their eyes they drowned this guaranteed winner in obscenity and blood if you are an 18 year old marine or just out of jail enjoy if you are a parent or on a date or any other member of the target audience for movies skip this sleazy piece of poopnegative,this is one story i was told as a child which is totally destroyed by this movie something told to children by generation of parents totally twisted kiss of true love? no prince no dragon? it seems that nothing in this world is immune to free love movement i do respect everyone but some things should stay as they were whats next snowwhite is kissed by a witch who was always good inside? hansel & gretel were two boys? princess returned glass slipper to cinderella and they lived for ever and ever? on the other side acting effects sound everything is excellent but i do think it should be another story all by itself disney its a shame what you did with this epic story just to be in the flownegative,this is one of those movies that should not have been made it is basically a d rated story with scifi thrown in to sell tickets the science is horrible so it only acts to aggravate scifi fans who assumed they would get something that is at least half researched so how is it bad? lets see they build up ai as something superhuman only to find out that it is easily foilable with a simple computer virus written in a matter of hours by a few hackers the authorities decide to collude with terrorists to combat a future perceived threat that has not actually committed any sort of crime the terrorist are basically your run of the mill antitech revolutionaries with brains the size of toe nail clippings and all happen to be scientists themselves the movie cheapens science and scientists considerably making them appear petty brutal and plain stupid which is actually incredible offensive to those who worked hard to achieve something in the field skip this movie just watch a cheap mexican soap opera it will be time better spentnegative,this is one of the worst films in recent memory everything about it was terrible the  the acting the characters the dialogue and the absolutely ridiculous and insulting holefilled plot do not waste your money on this garbage it will only make you angry not a single note of this film rings true nothing that happens seems even remotely plausible spoilers the pike character frames the man she kills for her kidnapping and the police buy it not really sure why they dont check to see if he had an alibi for the day she disappeared not really sure why they believe that she murdered her kidnapper while being raped and then instead of calling 911 she got in a car covered in blood and drove to another state to be with her husband who  according to her own diary  she believed hated her and wanted to kill her writing this and having to remember this stupid film is making me angry again im gonna stop dont go see this garbage watch body heat instead it is way betternegative,this is not the worst remake in film history i have never understood the idea of a remake at all if an anime like cinderella monogatarie is so good to start with why on earth do you want to try and improve on it? if you insist on tampering with perfection why then do you have to try to recreate it in its whole? there is nothing original here kenneth branagh put nothing of himself into this film they say imitation is the highest form of flattery but this is ridiculous there are a lot of sides to a parable as complex as cindarella and i suspect that branagh may have wanted to explore them instead the studio forced him into sticking to a cheap liveaction imitation of the popular anime in the end kenneth branagh set out to pay homage to a great anime instead he cheapened it and created a movie that is not worthy of late night cablenegative,this is my first review and i am compelled to write it t counter all the 10 star ratings this is possibly the worst movie ever made i fell asleep several times and would have left had i not been sitting in the middle of the row of seats i wanted to ask for my money back at the end of the film its just boring and nonsensical why is every actor in the movie crying all the time? why does mm mumblewhisper all his lines? i felt no emotional connection to any of the characters and didnt care if they lived or died i heard this was an amazing movie and was looking forward to seeing it but the only thing amazing about it is how much money and talent was turned into such a big steaming pile of dog excrementnegative,this is it these parody films and wannabe spy genre films has got to stop because this is what ruins the original franchise and makes fun of it shame on these people i cannot even dream about someone making fun of sean connery and his bond but people did it the reason is no person on this earth is cool as him sean is not a actor but the definition of man itself period however this film makes fun of pierce brosnan 007 era films with exploding pens and gadgets etc brosnan is a boss he redefined spy genre the makers of kingsman should be sued for this blasphemy i dont care if it is rated r or pg 13 i saw this film and i got angry specially with sir samuelljackson i lost respect for him i mean how is this classic method actor can do this film from pulp fiction to pure pg 13 garbage stuff i got exited when i saw him being funny but by the time climax came his death scene is the funniest moment in the entire film he was embarrassing himself just what the hell is going on these days is hollywood running out of ideas they have same story lines over and over again repeating same thing million times what is wrong with these people kids with guns using bad language and violence for no reason even killing animals what a shameful era we are living in let me clear this up a bit this is not a snuffporn or exploitation film filled with sex but even those have some bloody standard at least they are serious about it and makers know what they are making but this one is nonsense mathew vaughn made just one good film in his life probably his last best too it is called layer cake with daniel craig check that out guys if you have not but avoid this crap please the plot let us look at the plot here it goes as a spy agency hires kids so they can battle evil villains who are about to destroy the world oh please why drag kids and teens into this kids already ruined wrestling attitude era this is coming from a 90s kid batista and john cena acts in lame movies too because they still aim it for kids ala guardians of galaxy etc parents are proud of it but the hypocrisy is that people hate kristen stewart and dakota fanning when they do goo serious dramatic films special vfxcgi effectsgore goes useless the dialogs are so cheesy it makes cartoon network looks like history channel this is high time minus point this film looses it people are asking for a refund me too but who will listen if films like these are still coming out whatever this is hollywood or british production it is the direction sucked big time so my question with critics and people is how dare all of you hate john wooang lee & ridley scott these guys are legends and their movies are gold hey even a tinto brass movie is better then kingsman any day colin firth was crazy for cash yes there are some hot sexy women here but wasted for people who want a great spy film watch mi22000 or for comedy try rush hour 2 as for action go back and try drunken master or matrix trilogy even but stay way from this guys dont believe the hype critics are blind i am waiting for bad boy 3 michael bay will show these kids how real action is done overall kingsmanthe secret service 2015 is the worst film of 2015 my rating is 110skipp it save your money & time please i have wasted minenegative,this is by far the worst movie of 2014 character development doesnt exists in this movie nor any interesting dialogs or any real suspense moments the plot is dragging way too long and doesnt reach any climax if the film would have been 90 minutes long instead of 170 it could have been less of a torture the film  is irritating and dull which suits the banal script just fine i dont remember when was the last time i left the theater so angry and bored before watching this movie just stay away from this banal piece of nothingnegative,this is an attempt at giving sleeping beauty the wicked treatment tries and fails dismally first of all the magic kingdom is fantastic with lots of bright cgi forest dwelling folk frittering around the screen this will be enough for most small children to get their moneys worth above that this film is awful the plot does not work on any level now i know this is a childrens fairy tale no one is rewriting shawshank here but the story is so awful it is insulting to the intelligence of infants basically the producer has gone down a check list of standard movie elements so we need a flying scene a battle scene a magic forest a princess check check  check check then at the last minute someone remembered they had to hammer the whole thing into an alternate sleeping beauty small children will be entertained by the graphics adults will be dumb founded by the unnecessary moronic story i was left wondering  given the true turn of events  who is propagating the version of sleeping beauty we all know anyway?negative,this is a truly awful movie that cannot be related to on any level a total waste of a famous cast what an absurd story a dying man uploads his mind onto a computer then some nonsensical fighting ensues between those who are for and against such things johnny depp doesnt need to do such bad movies stoned faced performance by the way rebecca hall too unattractive for the lead female morgan freeman needs to display some selectiveness cillian murphy and paul bettany dont know what you were fighting for this type of bad sci fi rubbish has got to stop it deserves to be forgotten like it was never made at all makes inception seem logical by comparisonnegative,this is a true zombie fest the undead have made a television show and to underline this i ask the question does anyone ever stay dead on this show? i mean how would we know anyway? i imagine if i was a zombie this would be the show to try out for or perhaps as the show runner or as a writerswooden stumbling desperate i suppose if youre watching this on tv the commercials would come as a relief or perhaps the zombies are holding families of the writers hostage and making them write this show makes sure the most wooden actors possible are cast or the best actors at acting really badly again its on netflix which is usually a pretty good sign that it will be pretty awfulnegative,this is a formal request to matt damon matthew mccougnehey christopher nolan and the rest of the people behind this movie to give me three hours of my life back i warn anyone that is considering to watch this movie dont this movie is riddled with plot holes a storyline that is so formulaic and predictable that it borders on something a 5th grader could have wrote if you watch the first 20 minutes of the movie the rest of the movie you will just be waiting for the stuff that you know will happen to happen there is little room for surprise and even less room for enjoyment adding to this the visuals in the movie are a huge problem in watching it i got a headache and motion sickness so not only was i left with a feeling of wasted time after leaving the cinema i also felt physically ill i feel the actors in this movie are all outside their comfort zones and the acting feels very forced and it feels like not even the actors in the movie want to be a part of it i would recommend this movie to anyone that enjoyed the room with tommy wiseau or gigli with ben affleck and jennifer lopez because i think we have a new winner in the unwatchable movie hall of fame interstellarnegative,this has got to be the most overrated show in the history of tv series the idea at the beginning of this show was great but the character of oliver is awful how can the writers let this be like that? did they ever read the comics? oliver queen was a joyful character with a lot of jokes that was special about him that even if he lost a lot he still had the power to smile and make funny jokes all of this just makes the show bad from the start instead we see a robot with no personality that falls in love with anyone anytime season 1 was ok but it was obvious that it was mediocre at best and that was written by people who knew nothing about writing a good screenplay the worst part was that they kept that my name is oliver queen thing and previously on arrow although every episode apart from the season finale had no connection what so ever with the other episodes except the characters another bad thing was the obvious made up as the show went on thing the writers were always changing the story so that the story on the island could fit and be the same like the one from the present it just doesnt feel right and this cant be just a coincidence probably the best argument for this would be the episode from season 2 when oliver caught sarah and the first thing he remembered was how she drown with the yacht in the beginning of season 1 really? shouldnt he remember the last thing that happened between them that got sarah killed can no one else see that? are the writers so stupid to contradict themselves always when they need to introduce someone new to the show the finale was stupid stupid seeing at the end that oliver was transported in hong kong from the island and somehow he made it back really? am i supposed to buy this? i can guess that at the end of third season there will be another person like amanda that comes and take oliver back to the island or some place else thats just obvious made up on the way people about the mirakuru i have nothing to say except another contradiction a very convenient coincidence that on the island oliver had a cure and in real world he had again a cure for slade it just feels stupid that all the show is centered about oliver making choices between right and wrong its just like a propaganda next when slade soldiers were encountered first by oliver he couldnt even hurt them but in the end he fights them like they are usual people although detective lance was seriously injured by one of those thugs how can no one see this contradictions in the show? are they so well hidden or only the brainless are watching the show right now probably because there are few votes for each episode and only high ones from those who think the show is good but in reality people with brain left the show a long time ago if the writers want to make a link between the present days and slade from the island why cant they show something else and then in season 3 or four show how slade got injected and became so bad watch lost and see how some things are left unresolved and then the writers show how everything happened and surprise you but here there is no surprise you know that oliver did something to upset slade and youre just expecting that bad bad and bad i have nothing to say about this stupid show that had potential but it was destroyed by stupid writers in the future if you want to see a good hero movietv series watch one that portrays well the comics and is real in what can it be like the dark knight trilogy the writers from this show decided to destroy another show the flash and i strongly recommend that you dont watch that either 110 totally awfulnegative,this had a lot going for it a charismatic willing star who could really carry off a fantastic character a juicy betrayal to get the tale going and a lot of great special effects but unfortunately you cant stop there story pacing supporting cast winning characters? oops   we blew the budget with ajs wings and the cgi so so  is it a spoiler to say that the plot pretty much goes nowhere and that by the end you are so dying for it to be over you dont even care what happens?? if good conflict is what drives a good narrative does the absence of any good conflict  very much the case with this plodding slackly handled drearathon  make a bad one? the worst thing about this which leaves quite a bad taste in your mouth is that in redeeming the character of maleficent they decide to depict that she wasnt a mean old spinster she was a deeply loving maternal figure who was just bitter cuz she got royally screwed over by a guy she trusted its so schmaltzy its kitsch im a guy and this stuff offends my paltry feminism considering some of the takenoprisoners characters that aj plays and plays well i am surprised she even took this part but i suspect it was doing a screen test with the kudu horns on i might have even taken the part just to wear those oh and this movie at press time had a 71 rating i mean come on i know this is more or less a kids movie but a good kids movie is good so we can just go ahead and say that a bad kids movie is bad just take a similar movie enchanted  which had great songs a fantastic cast a charming funny sweet and complex story it is rated at 72negative,this had a lot going for it a charismatic willing star who could really carry off

plays and plays well i am surprised she even took this part but i suspect it was doing a screen test with the kudu horns on i might have even taken the part just to wear those oh and this movie at press time had a 71 rating i mean come on i know this is more or less a kids movie but a good kids movie is good so we can just go ahead and say that a bad kids movie is bad just take a similar movie enchanted  which had great songs a fantastic cast a charming funny sweet and complex story it is rated at 72negative,this first mi movie was bad enough as it was now that we are on mi 12 or something like that it just makes it worse most puzzling is that many of the actors in this movie have done great movies thus i have to wonder were they improving in this piece of crap? was de palma just like meh f*ck it let the special effects guys write this garbage dont get me wrong tom cruise is an awful actor anyway but christ it was a socalled all star lineup if it wasnt touted to this day as a good movie i wouldnt comment but this sh*t will not end kill it already in my opinion if you havent seen this movie consider yourself luckynegative,this film sucked on every level imaginable from the script the acting the sound track the physics the cinematography the directing the editing the flow the lack of transition the script the acting the sound track the physics the cinematography    oops  my keyboard momentarily slipped into a transdimensional time altering state of flux that actually made more sense than anything about the film interstellar actually the film sucked with a force far greater than any gravitational pull exerted by a black hole that it literally pulled any intelligence out of the minds of the films viewers thereby destroying any rational or true cognitive ability to make a sound review of this really really really great film i want my mommy   negative,this film is tripe synonyms  cheese crapola dreck muck rubbish sleaze slop slush trash related words  camp kitsch claptrap humbug nonsense bomb clinker clunker dud lemon stinker turkey mess muddle shambles the one good thing about this movie is that it made me want to view stanley kubricks 2001 a space odyssey again not even imax saves this film and an 89 rating here is proof that hollywood owns imdb youll be better of getting your reviews from rotten tomatoes because this movie isnt at all fresh christopher nolan you had me with inception but you lost me here please leave the blockbuster drama to steven spielberg and the planetary sci fi to ridley scott & james cameron thanksnegative,this film is mostly just a video game without the controller there wasnt enough of the story to explain who the characters were it just jumps right in the scenes and dialogue happen very fast the villain was yet another classic villain who only does things because hes the bad guy and he likes dark places and wears spooky clothing because hes evil there is another villain who shows up in the movie who is presented as being badder than the main villain but then never shows up again this made no sense the characters rocket and groot added a little humor here and there as well as the other main characters but thats pretty much what all of the movie was there was no real sense of danger because at every twist and turn the heroes would solve it within five minutes or whatever even very very very big spaceships with giant laser beams approaching a planet felt like no danger because it always seemed that the heroes could handle it this is the problem with most action movies nowadays every thing in it is made to be epic and amazing movie viewers all around the world are constantly being shown movies with things that are specifically made to be epic and amazing that incredible cgi and other special effects begin to seem mediocre and they get used to it so much that nothing seems to amaze anyone anymore because every action movie is made in that way theres no more star wars kind of effects on audiences where they are thrilled by something new and creative this movie is mostly just a big show to dazzle spectators with special effects that you have to look very carefully to find any good storytelling in the film there has to be a balance between good story telling and good cgi in a film like this but instead this film is nothing but constant cgi explosions and cheesy oneliners that we begin to forget what the story is or why things are happening however the plot was extremely simple the villain had no sense of having a specific reason why he wanted to rule the galaxy all the characters are introduced too fast that we dont get used to them or relate to them the movie is like watching a video gamenegative,this film is an antiintellectual zenith it is offensive at least for someone who has a rudimentary knowledge of astrophysics and the theory of relativity i have never seen such sf movie full of nonsense at least in the last 20 years every single law of physics is broken or adjusted to hollywood pulp ethical problems concerning time travel were already discussed 60 years ago medeagaia hypothesis is an old fairy tale pseudo philosophical use of feelings with respect to the multidimensional timespace is simply ridiculous situations that occur in the vicinity of the event horizon i can only say serious case of ignorance and standard use moral treatise about human nature based on common sense is too obvious someone who makes movies based on comic books shouldnt be allowed to make a sf movie really bad choice i am disappointed very disappointed 1 point is for the robots best regardsnegative,this film glorifies sodomy it mentions global warming as if its a real thing it implies strongly that margaret thatcher was not a positive political figure it portrays christians as lunatics worthy of slaughter the foul language is so gratuitous that one has to wonder if the filmmakers think its clever or what point it is theyre trying to make by taking that road there are no heroes or any sort of virtuous characters to latch onto the plot is full of holes i could go on but suffice it to say that this is lowgrade filmmaking and a waste of everyones time my wife and i both disliked it and wish we had our afternoon backnegative,this dreary  boring  depressing  and overly long scifi flick is about the dying earth and the last desperate attempts to repopulate another world with human beings  unless you are stephen hawking or neil degrasse tyson or you possess a degree in quantum physics  thermodynamics  time warps  black holes and worm holes you will not understand all of the technical jargon the viewer is constantly bombarded with  to make matters worse matthew mcconaughey is probably the best mumbler in hollywood  i did not understand a single line that came out of his face  anyway the great dust bowl of the 1930s has returned to wreck havoc on the world only this time it really means business  matthew mcconaughey  the worlds greatest astronaut turned farmer  is chosen to be the earths savior  his interstellar space craft endurance is capable of traveling through the vastness of space and time  it is also armored like a battleship that can withstand explosions  collisions  and a gigantic tsunami wave 1000 feet high  anne hathaway is the cryogenics expert  she looks a lot more convincing playing catwoman than the endurances genius co astronaut  this movie is quite confusing for the average movie goer with an iq of under 140 to comprehend  interstellar is gloomy and awful and definitely not worthy of your two and a half hours  i would recommend george pals 1951 scifi classic  when worlds collide  over this boring and lifeless piece of space junk   not hot pwhnegative,this does contain a spoiler one that if i would have known i wouldnt have wasted my time or money i dont like to even watch trailers on movies because i want no preconception of how a movie is going to be this movie has single handily changed 30+ years of thinking i thought the story was very well written and acted despite almost always knowing what the twists were going to be until the pace was so slow and could have been compressed into a normal 7585 minute movie my guess is that the reason there was no ending was because they ran out of time for dragging it on like they did when the credits hit the entire audience i was with pretty much let out a stream of obscenities and we all felt like the producersdirectorsstudio all just gave us two middle fingers i could have dealt with the slow pace if they would have just wrapped up the movienegative,this back show is terrible they have the spoiled rich boy coming back to take vengeance on the evil rich friends of his parents which plays well to the obamaera class warfare but little else the core seems to be if you got rich you did evil to get there really? he cant fight crime he has to be on this vendetta crusade? plus there is the whole thing of the constant flashbacks to his life on the island brought in every episode couldnt just tell us the back story in one episode? this is such a disappointment after smallville was brought to the network i had a hard time watching it bad scripts bad plots and acting that would do 1966 william shatner proud all top this offnegative,they stole the entire movie from orlando corradis version of cinderella which was fantabulous creation i never knew they were such cheats guys do check out orlando corradis anime version of cinderella and youll know all theyve got whole storyline running from there its just that its not an animation this time orlando corradis version is really old one they needed peoples attention and praises so cheated whole thing from someone else how cheap isnt it? corradi is no more i guess but still i think his works are worth an applause maybe its just because am a big fan of animes but this is too much never ever gonna watch this disneys version i feel bad for corradinegative,there is something deeply unsettling about sitting in a movie theater surrounded by people who are laughing as on screen heads are exploding limbs are being hacked off and a princess rewards her rescuer with anal sex the film starts out on a promising and engaging note as we follow the recruitment and training of the protagonist but then at about the midway point things get terribly weird and weirdly terrible this is not just movie violence but violenceporn violence for laughs violence that glories in being shocking and over the top the movie itself in terms of filmcraft is disposable and forgettable but what sticks with me is a nagging feeling that what ive just watchedin the guise of a movie purportedly about a refined british spy agencyis a marker of the decline of western civilization kingsman is the roman circus for the 21st century and every bit as brutal and pointlessnegative,there is nothing good about this movie the television show had a format this movie takes the name of the show but does not follow the format at all the television show was fun but this movie is slow and boring and has no likeable characters i do not know why they even bothered to name it after the television shownegative,there is no way on earth that these positive reviews are real this was hands down the worst movie experience of my life it made shark boy and lava girl seem like a masterpiece both of these movies were seen at the urging of the same sonalbeit almost a decade apart i cannot believe i ruined date night with my wife over this 3 hour hellfest i alternated between scratching my head holding back laughing wanting to yell out jokes about lincoln commercials and not being able to hold back laughing based on the looks from everyone else as they were leaving the theater we all shared the same sentiments go ahead blow $10 on this miserable ridiculous implausible pile of poopy that would make m night shamalyan scream out you have got to be friggin kidding me at the movies attempts at plot twistsnegative,there have been too many versions of the movie cinderella and this modern version was so disappointing indeed it is made for kids only and not for adults the movie was so boring walt disney pictures did not offer anything new in this dull and outdated sequel the remake was much worse than copy and pastea lot of imitation of cinderella movies and nothing original walt disney stole all the ideas and movie plot from orlando corradi see orlando corradis cinderella movie and see the shocking evidence how disney is clever in rip off & theft the acting is so tasteless see the original version and avoid this imitated versionnegative,there box in the book i dont why it was even in there i just added more confusion next her hair cut was awful  i know fault in our stars she couldve kept the wig from the beginning of the movie next they barely include side characters  christina hector etc  dont expect anything from the book jeanine doesnt get killed by evelyn but by tori what is sad is that peter and eric were my actors then all start randomly running towards the fence after as if they are all gonna get out  which doesnt happen  then the jeanines army randomly go in amity in the beginning with barely any marcus evelyn standing on the side stalking four  it is a good movie if u havent read the book but if u reach the book you are screwednegative,there are so many to list but they are so obvious and stupid that the suspension of disbelief is totally gone nano bots so small they are in the air and rain yet to be infected these people must be touched? ridiculous everyone in the entire area would be breathing them nano bots repair tissue heal skin restore eyesight? okay that is futuristic and believable main facility loses power and they are no longer getting healed okay i suppose the nanobots need some form of power but the previously healed revert back the blind man goes blind again? ridiculous he was already healed why do the fallen wounded float up to standing like some silly paranormal phenomenon? stupid effects that are so out of place and ruin the moment over and over again this movie was a complete poosandwich and the fact they gross over $100m is tantamount to theftnegative,there are people out there who can write a half decent script and dont get the opportunity to ever have it heard there are people out there who have serious acting skill and never get seen there are scifi movies that have an original story that dont have a budget to be released at their full potential support people with talent and original ideas do not see guardians of the galaxy as it contains nothing that vaguely resembles any of those things congratulations on nailing the cgi though guys that was great if i felt like staring at great cgi for two and a half hours though id play call of dutynegative,then this will be an amazing show if on the other hand you set your own standards and can read beyond the 9th grade level well youll find the dialog premise and sensationalism just too void of all reality and sensibility the characters interaction with one another is very one dimensional and monotone its like theyre robots with the single emotion of despair the male characters conversational scenes all have that iloveyou innuendo much like smallville supernatural and most any show that has been produced by the cw or the people involved in these shows the only thing missing from the homosexual innuendo is the scenes followed up by glorified anal sex the dialog is just outrageously terrible as if everything in these characters lives is emotionally draining and just having a simple normal human conversation is beyond their coping abilities every conversation is a scene of coping its just so manipulative in an attempt to get the consumer deeply empathizing with the characters and creating a very unhealthy unnatural emotional attachment to fantasy rather then finding these needs within their real relationships every show on cw does this and i truly see the fate of our species being quite dire as the consequence sure its your fault for watching but just as much theirs for making it available the action varies from awesome to stupid we have the nonsensical flipping spinning acrobatic maneuvers that would get you killed along with a man with a bow and arrow out gunning 12 men with fully automatic weapons that never seem to run out of bullets how is that good entertainment? its just the same crap ive been seeing since i was 8 years old that became increasingly stupid to me starting at about the age of 15 it went from well i am watching for the outrageous unbelievable fantasy action film or show to why am i still watching this crap? its a lot of money to deliver us the same nonsense were used to theyre exploiting the immaturity of the current generation who has decided to let the world set their standards and assume that since everyone else is going along for the ride their standards must be high i just see no point in taking the action style of hercules legendary journeys and giving it a bigger budget and more takes so the editors can churn out something suitable for prime time face it youre a bunch of half wits with pathetically low standards if youre over the age of 16 and think this is an awesome show its a show for children teenage girls and middle aged women like most of cws programmingnegative,the writing for this series is beyond simplistic and is heavy handed which coincidentally aligns perfectly with the amateurish direction and phenomenally bad acting david ramsey puts in the best performances which should speak volumes about the stink quality of the other actors the cgi quality is laughable video games have better effects for petes sake the editing of the fight sequences at times look as if a live actor is fighting a blue screen and the foes are edited in later and rather poorly at that then it looks as if frames are removed to make the action appear faster the result is the arrow is fighting a bit out of phase with the other combatants and the action looks choppy as well two episodes in and i cant imagine this hopeless dreck surviving a complete season even on a twobit channel like the cwnegative,the visuals were wonderful and that is about all i can say that was good about this film either the men were without members or were brutish bastages that were the cause of all the problems it started out good but why is it that there has to be a different take on a film or story just to outright slander defile and degrade men? i tried to like it but i see this trend in a lot of movies today women can be pure evil in their own right without the help of a man i was really hoping that elle fanning would shine in this film but she was mind numbingly dull the three fairies were stupid the prince should not even have been in the film if he was not going to save her with a kiss the true loves kiss part was wickedly betrayed by what only another woman can give even if she is not the girls mother is this what you want your daughter to think about men in general?negative,the universe is full of fascinating facts its mindbending to contemplate for example the awesome size of our galaxy light travels 186000 miles per second and yet it takes 100000 years for a single beam of light to cross the entire milky way galaxy and our galaxy to quote carl sagan is only one among billions and billions the vastness of space truly is stunning but thanks to a worm hole the folks in interstellar leave the milky way in a cosmic snap of the fingers and yet having just achieved this most amazing of all feats our heroes are pretty much bored to tears instead everybody is more concerned with some fatherdaughter relationship that wasnt developed in the first place look if youre going to make a movie that purports to explore the fascinating mysteries of the universe then do it have some wonderment in the story dazzle me not only with visuals but with amazement at the astonishing scope of our universe and why not produce a script that obeys the laws of astrophysics or at least some theories thereof? this movie takes something that would dwarf the apollo lunar missions and turns it into some ridiculous plan aplan b tediousness i suggest instead watching through the wormhole with morgan freeman or re watching 2001 a space odyssey heck even contact with jodie foster is far more entertaining and imaginative than interstellar and yet  92 stars im not saying 10star reviews on this site are phony after all major film critics also are raving about interstellar unfortunately i find most professional film critics about as credible as the physics in this movie frankly interstellar is a boring movie and if that puts me in the vast minority of reviewers fine i can live with that because i have minimum standards when i pay $11 for admission and $850 for large popcorn stay home and read a good book instead or just gaze out at the night sky and reflect on our amazing universenegative,the trailers had me anticipating something like early james bond as a super hero this movie made the characters look like jokes the obviously sped up fight scenes looked stupid and omg samuel jackson looked ridiculous dressed like a skater punk besides the fact that it was totally outside the atmosphere that the movie was supposedly creating it is just sad for samuel jackson i get why the studios might want to hide the fact that he is almost 70 and looks more like 90 these days sean connery had the good sense to age gracefully instead of foolishly and jackson or his handlers should try that other than that what i can tell you about the movie without spoilers is limited  it is an action movie that i suppose is about as good as most in the genre but it could have been more it seemed to be an attempt to create a new mythical hero in the kingsman and i believe that was a failure it was unclear why these people existed as chaos and death seemed even more likely with them than without them kingsman is a poor myth because it does not seem to have any purpose other than its own glorification thats hollywood i guess but i hoped for morenegative,the trailer looked incredibly stupid but i went anyway for the positive reviews for the duration i couldnt shake the fact that everything i was seeing i had already seen many times before and that this film had nothing new to offer gotg lacks an ounce of anything it can call its own and so succeeds almost purely on sentimentality for the 80s from which it took most of the scenes mid showing i walked out to make a phone call i almost walked back in to finish the film but decided that nothing in the second half could justify the lack of story character wit or creativity that the first half utterly lacked fortunately i saw it alone so i didnt have to deal with the social pressure to stay if you see this then i would recommend the early matine discountnegative,the trailer looked incredibly stupid but i went anyway for the positive reviews for the duration i couldnt shake the fact that everything i was

early matin_e discountnegative,the story was initially promising but after mission start of the film had unfortunately many lengths it would have been better to put this place 2h 3h the whole film has somehow worked very pieced together  the scifi ideas were sometimes quite ok but not consistent in star trek z b the makers have previously carefully considered to create a coherent picture to in this film here it creates the rocket spaceship with his ridiculous drive to escape the pull of the black hole  the special effects were on the level of 90 years  since ive been hoping for much more i went because of the extremely good reviews on imdb in this film and am just disappointed negative,the script is predictable and badly executed acting is lame the trailer is misleading the characters and the plot did not click with me at all the cgi effects are awful not believable there in logic in the movie it is more like zombie movie if you want to see something nice with a nice sense of humor and the actual interesting plot then please do not watch this you will definitely be wasting your time what you get here is that you know the end of the first 5 minutes i mean come on the fight will be accepted in high society and movies about it was a hit 30 years ago if you have the money or you are a smart man you will be welcomed throughout the world this is really poor movie avoid this crapnegative,the reviews  here made me look forward to watching this movie but what a disappointment it was i am seriously wondering what is wrong with todays audience when a movie like this get such good reviews maybe its just a wrong idea of science fiction maybe people label budget fantasy movies science fiction ? anyway lets have a quick look at some of the bad point of this movie first the lead actor i dont know how he is perceived in the us but looking with an european view mcconaughey is just plain horrible at acting he has no facial expressions and talks english with a slow slur that is really annoying then later on in the movie i see a good actor like topper grace and wonder what the casting director thought when shehe hired mcconaughey there is just no emotional connection between him and any of the other characters even when he cries it feels like someone just drop some vaseline over his face and he just sits there waiting till its lunch again mcconaughey should be a car salesman not an actor then there is the pace of this slow moving epic we spend god knows how many hours in some dust bowl house where people stare outside and drive in pickup trucks with high technology equipment to bring down indian drones for using their solar panels to probably power an old play station 3 i kid you not the way the lead manages to find the secret nasa base is laughable there is a base with literally hundreds of people working there in the middle of a field without the huge parking lot for all their pickups trucks remember earth is dying so everyone has a v8 pickup to find indian drones then there is the so called science in the movie apparently they even hired a professor to help them with the science part well dear professor please join mcconaughey as a car salesman as you dont have one clue about science and if the audience thinks the movie is using it i have a bad feeling about the future of our species the radiation the fact that they walk about on a planet with sun light orbiting a black hole where we have so much gravity that every hour there is 7 years on earth and even the same for the station they left orbiting just 200 miles up is just one silly example of course mcconaughey has no problems with relativity time shifts once he enters the black hole of course how could he otherwise meet up with his dying daughter to make a real american ending to this disaster of a movie then there is the robot made for a budget movie looking so cheap and probably assembled from cardboard with aluminum foil  as you can see it almost bobbing about in the wind two obligatory lcd panels show scrolling text as the robot talks and stumbles about that robot sets the level for the special effects they look cheap  badly filmed from the perspective of the space ship most of the time as if they had some plastic contraption with a gopro attached to it handled by a 12 year old going bzzzzzzz as he moves it about yes its that bad there are many bad movies around and this is just one of them but what baffles me is why this piece of overlong budget fantasy gets so many good reviews did the people here not see other movies ever ? did they miss alien gravity or even star wars not that the last one is science fiction but at least its entertaining and this was not hoping hollywood wakes up at some point and starts making movies again with depth and science instead of cheap fantasy aimed at  yeah what is the target audience for this and mcconaughey please leave the movie industry and join the nearest chevy dealernegative,the reason im writing this review is because i was told it an amazing movie etc etc however i would advise you all to not waste your time mathew mcconeghey is an excellent actor no doubt but in this movie i find him mumbling and its hard to understand what hes saying the storyline is completely unbelievable it does not make sense in the least its a really big stretch of the imagination and lets not forget matt damons role im still trying to figure out why he would play such an insignificant and antagonistic role opposite mathew mcconeghey as far as the graphics go i watched it in imax and though the special effects are cool in imax its not worth the 2 hrs of your time basicallyyoull walk out of there googling almost every phrase you heard dont say no one warned you negative,the problem with kingsman the secret service is that it cant decide whether its a spy movie or a movie about violent killers or a comedy it tries to do some of all three it partially succeeds as a spy movie owing a lot to old james bond films and did anyone catch the reference to get smart? and granted there are a few funny moments but the violence overwhelms everything else theres plenty of gratuitous killing and its not the least bit subtle if thats your cup of tea prepare to have a great time for me i think the story would be have been better if 90% of the fight scenes had been left on the cutting room floor plotwise its completely predictable a few minutes into the movie we can already guess which two characters would end up in a fight to the finish at the end very mild spoiler alert the movie ends with the audience essentially being mooned thanks a lot guys id gladly return the favor if i knew you were watching one last point some user reviews have complained that the fword is used quite a bit it is but really is that the most offensive thing here? the entire premise of the dastardly project and the implication that almost every world leader mindlessly buys into it is far worse not to mention the almost nonstop display of blood and guts some of the killings are presented in an almost comical way and neednt be taken seriously but most of it is just grossly and needlessly excessivenegative,the plot in the near future earth has been devastated by drought and famine causing a scarcity in food and extreme changes in climate when humanity is facing extinction a mysterious rip in the spacetime continuum is discovered giving mankind the opportunity to widen its lifespan a group of explorers must travel beyond our solar system in search of a planet that can sustain life the crew of the endurance are required to think bigger and go further than any human in history as they embark on an interstellar voyage into the unknown coop the pilot of the endurance must decide between seeing his children again and the future of the human race nasas version of sophies choice its a horrible movie and i am shocked anyone likes it firstly it doesnt get moving until nearly an hour into this crapola by then most us us have checked out and have no interest the plot is idiotic and not even marginally based in the realm of scientific possibility i genuinely hated this movienegative,the only two things that i liked  a few pictures of prague and some more of emmanuelle bart two things of great beauty the story is completely unbelievable there are a lot of errors and a lot of unnecessary complications truly impossible but not in any way i expectednegative,the only two things that i liked  a few pictures of prague and some more of emmanuelle b_art two things of great beauty the story is completely unbelievable there are a lot of errors and a lot of unnecessary complications truly impossible but not in any way i expectednegative,the only thing worth seeing in this movie is the cgi it is beautifully done although i found the 3 fairies quite disturbing looking creatures and thus very unsettling i would give it an 8 for the cgi but the movie well thats quite another story they havent respected the classic the original story if so maleficent would be evil the original is a story of good vs evil right vs might and a lesson that love conquers all but rather than that simple formula this is a story of a jiltedbetrayed lover who seeks revenge through an innocent child to me that is not respecting the original story and it didnt bring us what we love about this story it isnt a different but classic fairy tale the formula for a classic fairy tale is that there are no muddled lines between good and evil this one muddles all the way through i didnt see anything in this movie that was even remotely reminiscent of the original only the names and the spindle it was just a dark and horrible story i wouldnt bring my kids to see it this isnt a lesson of goods triumph over evil this is some sort of warped tale of psychological excuses for bad or deviant behavior instead of teaching children right is right and wrong is wrong it teaches that wrong can be right just so long as the person doing wrong thinks its fair or even worse cant be helped this antihero worship mentality is not what any child needs and is the ruin of our society lets root for the bad guy lets understand the bad guy the bad guy is the hero no one is truly bad everyone who does evil has a backstory that made them that way pity the refuse of society the things they do are either learned or they were born that way but either way they are justified or cant help it we should never blame or judge anyones behavior as truly bad because they must have a reason for being this way that could not be avoided dont blame me others actions made me do it i am right in whatever i do when i feel i have been wronged two wrongs dont make it right it makes it fair everything is excusable so long as i can think of an excuse so first she is right to want revenge and then she was right for trying to undo it and then she was right to defend herself it would seem she is always right regardless because right is perceived and judged against the emotion of the day so long as she felt it was right at the time she was never wrong no matter what she was doing she was always right she was just a victim of some selfish man men are putzes and men are evil show me one decent male role model in this story her companion was a weak tool governed by her his apparent feminine side was his only saving grace the prince was just a pretty face shallow and likely governed by his hormones the king was a user a phony governed by his greed the message here is women dont need men men are motivated and controlled by their lusts and women are motivated by their heart and purest emotions women should be strong and not be fooled by a mans affections when people do bad it must have been for a good reason and really isnt wrong of them bad behavior doesnt warrant our anger or judgement but begs our understanding and compassion any attempt at a classic good vs evil concept only seems to appear in this movie in the vein of women being good and strong vs men being evil and weak to conclude this story somehow meant to convey that love conquers all is a sham this movie is pure feminist and thug raising tripe this movie is unfit for children no beauty appears in this dark tale alas it must have been sleepingi am certain mr walt disney is rolling over in his grave again and again over stuff like this this totally destroyed the disney original it basically told every viewer flat out you were lied to the first story was just a pack of lies your parents told you they have been lying about maleficent for ages poor maleficent evil parents what other lies have your parents told you? santa? the easter bunny? how dare they make you believe in fictitious characters and happily ever afters they dont exist bad is good and good is bad and everything your parents try to tell you is a lie mr disney would have never done that and certainly never would have approved fantasies hopes dreams imaginations and the innocence of children was to be protected and encouraged at all costsnegative,the one is because the high  the movie is not that terrible and some entertainment value maybe a 410 is more appropriate i found ben affleck acting was quite bad i didnt care much about any of the characters but maybe the lead investigator but not much time is actually spent on the police work anyway the plot is just to impossibleincredible and the twists are just too convenient and stupid ultimately you dont really care about what is happening because the husband character is flat and ben seems completely disconnected with the events that happen to him he seems to not give 2 s**** why would he have married this psycho without noticing anything? i dont know and i dont carenegative,the name of the movie couldnt be better mission impossible because it was impossible of watching this is a very boring action film i hoped something better because the 2 tv series the nineties one and the sixties one were two great tv series but this movie man it was boring as hell i dont know how i didnt fall sleep in the middle of the movie it could be more boring? tom cruise in one of his worst performances not only him everyone in the movie were so lame the plot itself have no sense so this is my review one of the most boring films i have seen in my life i give it 110negative,the mumbled and unintelligible dialogue lost me for the first ten minutes but i gave it a second chance as the mystery developed the boring characters were just about bearable as the plot began to twist and turn but affleck and pike were so cold and mysterious even with each other that it was hard to like either of them so where was your emotional engagement here? only margo was remotely interesting this film also had some of the least erotic and downright odd sex scenes ever filmed this was a film of two parts the first part ran through all the clichs of the detective thriller but we were cheated in the second part when the villainess inexplicably got away with it in agatha christie books when the killer makes a mistake and has a sudden change of plans this is usually their undoing as things planned for the original crime stand out like sore thumbs in the adapted scenario then they get caught end of story in this particular tale it was the diary why would desi have taken it to a house he didnt know existed and fail to burn it properly when he could have burnt it in seconds in the fire at the crime scene ? the cops would have seen through that in seconds and then the rest of her contradictions would have unravelled what about the attempted purchase of an illegal gun ? the purchase of the car the credit card purchases of the electronic toys the puppets the treasure hunt clues ? none of which could be attributed to desi so someone else must have organised or staged them and just who was supposed to have tipped off the cops to the woodshed ? all non  sequetors that made no sense in the end columbo would have had her in the slammer long before the final reel but the cops just let her off  the non  examination by the medics of the blood covered pike was utterly ridiculous this hospital must miss lots of wounds as they simply dont look for them dont let me get taken to this sloppy hospital if i get run over  she would have had none of the injuries from the initial kidnapping but a mysterious venepuncture wound on her arm both of which would have lead the cops once again to think the kidnapping had been staged we also got treated to homages to fatal attraction and the hand that rocked the cradle were the female lead had to be totally insane not just confident and calculating this is the old male gaze all women are evil psychos drivel being rehashed for a new generation and we can do without itnegative,the mumbled and unintelligible dialogue lost me for the first ten minutes but i gave it a second chance as the mystery developed the boring characters were just about bearable as the plot began to twist and turn but affleck and pike were so cold and mysterious even with each other that it was hard to like either of them so where was your emotional engagement here? only margo was remotely interesting this film also had some of the least erotic and downright odd sex scenes ever filmed this was a film of two parts the first part ran through all the clich_s of the detective thriller but we were cheated in the second part when the villainess inexplicably got away with it in agatha christie books when the killer makes a mistake and has a sudden change of plans this is usually their undoing as things planned for the original crime stand out like sore thumbs in the adapted scenario then they get caught end of story in this particular tale it

all women are evil psychos drivel being rehashed for a new generation and we can do without itnegative,the movie would be descent if it wasnt 3 hours long found myself and my friend begging for the ending so we could walk out the theater as we were somewhere in the middle of the row i love the concept but i think its too linear  no major twists in the story that could come from nowhere everything is so predictable and could be packed in a maximum of 100 minutes also the soundtrack was killing me throughout the whole movie too sad and without energy not moving enough i think that the soundtrack was there to kill any thrill you could enjoy watching this film the animations are 1010 but overall i was glad when i finally got out the theater so  110 is my final verdictnegative,the movie was too long much to much scientific mumbo jumbo the special effects were a total let down saw it in imax not impressed the story had no speed very draggy performances were ok no oscars here the previews were the best part of the lure the middle was right out of 2001 space odyssey i have never been to a movie where so many people left about 2530 which was most of the crowd my daughter and i stuck it out hoping for some redemption but none came i should have seen it at a bargain matine very upset movie goer i know that this movie has gotten great reviews but really  take another look pleasenegative,the movie was too long much to much scientific mumbo jumbo the special effects were a total let down saw it in imax not impressed the story had no speed very draggy performances were

really  take another look pleasenegative,the movie was recommended to me by a friend who saw the reviews and somehow believed those huge mistake to say the movie is childish would be an honor for this movie i have seen plenty of animated movies which were a huge lot better the story is dumb and entirely predictable the characters are almost flat and have absolutely no credibility from either a serious point of view nor from a parody point of view acting was also poor visual effects were ok and being a 3d movie helped but that is the only positive thing that i can say about the movie the theater was halffull but during the entire movie there was not a single time when you could hear everybody laughing hard the only way i can imagine that so many 9 and 10 star reviews were added for this movie is since all the brainwashed marvel fanboys and sockpuppets for the studios somehow managed to overwhelm normal reviewersnegative,the movie was horrible i saw it because i was chaperoning four thirteen year old girls who were dying to see it the whole theater was full of a similar group sex and age subpar acting very idiotic main story a complete waste of time and money there is really no much more to be said perhaps i am not in the demographic for the book and movie i am over forty years old but i could not wait for it to finish to go home and spit the mouthful of puke i was holding please take my advise and spare yourself the suffering of this i sacrificed myself for you and i have come to advise you from your future not to fall as i didnegative,the movie versions of mission impossible are complete crap that are nothing like the tv series the movie versions of mission impossible turned the tv shows hero jim phelps into a bad guy and made a character ethan hunt who wasnt even in the tv series into the hero of the movies it would be like making a movie adaptation of the ateam with colonel hannibal smith turning into a bad guy killing the rest of the team and then having a totally new character not in the tv series be the hero of the movie moreover the movie versions of mission impossible are just another action movie with fancy stunts and bigbudget explosions like the james bond movies the tv series wasnt about stunts and explosions the tv series was about cleverlydevised cloakanddagger plots to trick the bad guys into turning against each other the tv series was about outsmarting the bad guys with brains not beating the bad guys with brawn in fact there were probably less punches thrown during the entire two tv series than during the mission impossible movie the producers of the mission impossible movie just wanted a way to market tom cruise in an action movie with fancy gadgets and bigbudget explosions but there are so many of these similar movies that have already been made so they called it mission impossible to lure in fans of the old tv series if youre just looking for a bigbudget remake of a rambotype movie then go ahead and see this movie but if youre a fan of the mission impossible tv series then dont waste your time on this crap of a movienegative,the movie starts lengthy with building the plot base everyone knows from the trailer or movie description after five minutes i already feel out of breath but try hard to sit through the boring conversations and the obvious i need lots of chips and popcorn to endure this phase after the long wait in the middle of the movie i am rewarded with excellent cgi effects and technological advances that would make everybody saliva and handle over their money immediately in real life its easy to fall in love with this digital creature who comes up with such great ideas i was thinking open api would be l33t if will casters mission was to transcend i was waiting for him to commit to github i was waiting for great things in this movie but the movie clearly was not made for the educated masses but for a stubborn religious audience who likes all movies to be the same the plot turned sour but not unexpectedly the religious fanatics who want to play god and control everything on this planet team up to destroy the new intelligence with mortars they repeatedly attack the data center trying to destroy the new hope for the planet of course the few religious lunatics win by the most crazy means ever with a virus its beyond me how a supercluster ai intelligence does not have security all emotional attachment aside there should be security running as basic protocols in the background after all he was connected to the internet a dangerous place was the data center running on windows xp first edition ?? in the beginning of the movie the first thing will caster did after going digital was to rewrite his code base this is what everybody would have done  optimize code all the time after all its his natural state to be digital and to innovate therefore the virus was impossible to implement the code to compromise by max waters did not even exist anymore  we learned that after 20 minutes in how would will  as an intelligent being  not create his own programming language and complete code rewrite? how??? all in all a very disappointing piece of cgi bliss it makes me upset about the religious screenwriter who once again gives us the american nightmare its possible to kill all innovation with weapons and religious people will always rule and controlnegative,the movie is not worth keep your kids from seeing this movie unless your want them to be disappointed and very confuse is a terrible change of something that was a beautiful master piece incredible to see and believe that the own owner of the sleeping beauty disney is destroying what everybody has come to love for generations i was very looking forward to see the movie since disney has a good record on movies although some of the last one has not been very good including this one but for example if you saw frozen you though disney is back to creativity and beautiful long lasting history that passed thru time this movie maleficent is not one of them you wont be attract to even repeat it nor less read it to your daughters as a bed time story maybe if disney management could use the imagination so much they promote to young ones they could it come up with a new history no one has ever heard before and could sell it but for what reason will disney corporation will destroy what is already a proving time after time years after years mom to girl princess to princess beautiful story where the prince rescue the princess the king father and queen mother love and protect their daughter and the bad witch lose and is destroy by the goodness and them the prince and princes leave happily ever after if only mr walt disney were alive to see of what his disney world has becomenegative,the movie chronicles the journey of a group of astronauts traveling through space in search of a new planet on which to establish a new colony of humans due to the physics involved they remain young whilst their family back on earth grow old their entire journey lasts for about 60 years considering the high ratings i really expected this to be an epic movie in reality nothing happens it literally felt as though i was trapped in their tiny little space ship for 60 years the plot is based on complex theoretical concepts but in the end makes no sense whatsoever there is no action no romance no comedy no special effects and very little meaningful dialogue if anything the movie has more of a documentary feel to it the visuals were nothing special and the music reminded me of a superman movie from the early 80s i just didnt get itnegative,the most retarded film ive seen so far with depp triumph of stupidity discreditation of science fruits of which we are using to better our lives each day a point that there is no life beyond human body is even more dumb a wife that should be in best traditions the first traitor of a man and a friend that is eager to kill you based on only his own assumptions also shocked the idea that a common way to act for people is to kill stuff first then think if i had options id love to send the script author to mars so he wont be able to share his idiotic primitive ideas never ever again after watching this movie i felt the upcoming depression from understanding that it was most likely targeted on the farmers popultaion of low educated people somewhere in albania that are living in darkness fear aggression and no hope not adviced to watched for people with iq > 90negative,the most disappointing movie of 2015 so far i was looking forward to it since the divergent was pretty consistent with just a few awkward spots however insurgent i would call it complete trash with just one goal  earn money the visual effects were good except for those long shots being made just for the 3d  like the flying above the city in the end it looked so cheap the plot is predictable very slowboring most of the crucial moments are too shallow in their results the movie completely lacks logical structure  not sure if its written like this in the book too spoler alert how everyone is so ok not to guard a guy who had been an enemy just few moments ago? how would whole army get to the building without being noticed?negative,the marvel team has once again given us another bunch of junk the ever growing marvel cinematic universe deserves to be destroyed and i found myself rooting for the bad guys to put the rest of the sappy characters out of their misery james gunn takes the helm of the fairly unknown guardians of the galaxy much to his detriment unlike iron man captain america and thor join this film as partners in grime an unmitigated disaster total junk a complete waste of time and utterly forgettable stay home and watch friends reruns they are more creative and still more relevant than this unimaginative unoriginal mishmash of plagiarized elements from other films ugghhhhnegative,the main actor is as wooden as they come and looks ridiculous in every scene after the opening few seconds i knew it was going to be awful i saw a bad explosion effect and a man wearing a silly looking hood and an obviously fake beard in fact everyone looks ridiculous with bad make up and lighting the writing is painfully dull any attempts at humor are mind bogglingly unfunny the main character is highly unlikable and it is difficult to find anything with which to identify the director seems to have done nothing but point the camera in the right direction as there is no flair or artistry evident how does this have a high review i just cant understand itnegative,the life of a young man mason from age 5 to age 18 where the actors ellar coltrane patricia arquette ethan hawke played the film in real time so it took 13 years to make one of the few films i have ever walked out on the others were in disgust but this one i left due to pure boredom one hour into the film and there had been only 5 minutes of drama then the film was back to documenting the boring fictional life of a boring fictional family now the whole idea of actors who age naturally with the film could have been interesting but the director completely pooched this fantastic opportunity by slavishly doing the film chronologically and slooooooowly instead of mixing it up a bit and showing us the boys life at 6 then at 18 then back to 15 but instead year trailed after year and after an hour i really felt like i had lived through those first few years in real time too so here is my list of things that are more fun that watching boyhood  cleaning your gutters did that earlier today and found a frog that was more exciting  waiting in the waiting room of the dentist at least there is some suspense  getting your teeth drilled by the dentist at least you feel something  a good bowel movement the smell only lasts a few minutes not three hours i could obviously continue but you get the drift this film is the ultimate triumph of style over substance nice idea technically totally forgettable as a filmnegative,the irony about transcendence is that its all about artificial intelligence but it lacks even the most natural of intelligence completely though it starts with a big promise of strong things to come it falls weak and on its knees so fast that once its done you realize that depp has taken you on a joy ride i cannot exactly say if its an entire waste of 120 minutes of your life but it sure does not add any more value to it transcendence looks like the big budget disaster of 2014 so far which the crown held by after earth last year for some its would be ok to argue that the movie was too complicated and its only for the thinkers but in my point of view thinking too much about this would only makes you feel sorry for doing it when will caster johnny depp who is a renowned scientist in artificial intelligence dies his wife uploads his consciousness to a program expecting that his great knowledge can be harvested for future as expected wills consciousness perform brilliantly but evolves in to a greater power and a threat than being an asset and when he breaks the barriers of nano technology he starts to play god the plot clearly has lot of potential but its not something groundbreaking or never heard of before therefore transcendence is already decades late but tries hard to be futuristic but still it could have being save it if didnt have some obvious mistakes there are so many plot holes that make it completely unjustifiable and qualify to be an effective science fiction or a drama if wish to continue to the end you have to completely withdraw yourself from them and go along but its something not very easy to do i dont want to give out any spoilers but keeping the ai part and the nano part aside as they are fictional the stuff that actually happens right now are depicted in a complete bogus manner here how the story flows and the events taken place is far from its narrative and you cant really forgive it seems like the cast is a way to salvage it but to be honest nor depp or morgan has a strong part to perform so their appearance is a waste the fans of both will only end up disappointed and there are some poor looking action scenes that pop up time to time and even that make little sense the cg is not brilliant and cinematography is mundane but the hope of the big cast and the plot i somehow went through the whole movienegative,the idea of the film is great they are exploring a side of cinema never before explored however i feel that taking on this task should have demanded more creativity and flare from the numb nuts who put this collage of rubbish together forgive me if ive missed anything but i feel that i spent the best part of 3 hours watching a rude illmannered brat grow up with a disappointingly boring life i spent the entire film looking for the beauty or the message in this masterpiece and left with a distinct feeling that the people who produced this hideous montage got carried away with how good they thought the idea was and refused to admit that they messed up nothing bloody happened my definition of a good film is one which makes you feel something which gives you a sense of excitement or admiration something which makes you think about an interesting topic i was present for my growing up and it was infinitely more interesting and personal than this fake hollywood crap also it would have been nice for it to have had an ending or some sort of redeeming quality like an announcement that we had actually been sitting through a practical joke and this film wasnt genuinely being considered great imdb rating 90? maybe thats a joke too and this is all one big joke and everyone in hollywood is laughing at us unfortunately the minimum rating is 110 whereas i believe negative possibilities would have been appropriate in ancient rome they had no concept of negative numbers i feel that seeing this film would have progressed their discovery of this side of 0 dont see this film please and for goodness sake dont let it win any oscars i dont want the industry to be polluted with films like thisnegative,the good reviews of interstellar on imdb are proof to me that movie studios pay people to post positive reviews of movies the current imdb rating is 91no way in hell is that an accurate rating this movie is awfulperiod how could any professional actor read the script for this movie and not be able to tell that it will be a terrible movie? i really would like to say something positive about the film since it has many of my favorite actors in it the actor list reads like a whos who of movie stars but i cannot think of one single positive thing to say about it trust me dont waste 3hours of your life on this film you will regret it just like i donegative,the good reviews made me watch the movie full out and this was one of the worst hours spent in my life i really have no clue how people can enjoy this movie only if it resonates with an interest for the mundane mediocre average life the movie has not one interesting plot twist the main character is an uninspiring slow paced cynical person his sister is also not a very interesting person to watch the dialogs are just average everyday conversations if this movie gets an oscar i seriously have my doubts about the voting system life can be an uplifting experience the whole movie seems to portray that life is a long string of events to which you have very little influence and the only thing you have left to do is wait and sit out life to me it is incomprehensible to take 12 years and come up with this very disappointing view on life and play it out so boringly there is one scene that actually touched me a plumber reflects back on a lifes lesson he got from one of the main characters and how this positively shaped his life simply said it is a waste to watch this movienegative,the good cinematography and acting this is a beautiful film and the starstudded cast did as well as could be expected under the circumstances the bad the script this film should be an edgeoftheseat thriller and an exploration of what is possible in the future instead it was as flat as a busted balloon there was no tension there was stuff exploding but we didnt care aside from the lack of suspense a contributing factor to the flaccid plot was the premise scifi films require a simple explanation for the breakthrough being depicted in back to the future we are taken all over the spacetime continuum we get the rules and we go along for the ride the concept of cyberhuman evolution is ahead of the story we do not get the parameters of the concept are these new beings cyberpeople? what are those flying dots? are they pieces of people or matter? there isnt a cohesive story about the scientific breakthrough we do not know when the characters are in jeopardy or what will happen when the thing gets them we dont know what the thing is even death does not have absolute boundaries in this film but there is no explanation for how johnny depp finds a way back at some point we give up trying to put together an explanation for the author and we dont believe it there ends the magic of film we cannot suspend disbelief any longernegative,the first two acts carried the movie brilliantly ive never laughed harder at more one word dialog lines the action was incredible and the actingsublime some of britains best leading men are on display and their charm and wit are matched only by the twinkling glee that all this is delivered with tonguefirmlyincheek and then they threw it all away in the third act what a disaster witty banter replaced with cannedcatchphrases charm replaced with scatological nonsense incredible stunts replaced with the same tired line work that grew old during the third matrix movie many movies disappoint because they never rise this movie disappoints by how close it came to being truly incredible want to know when to leave? leave when colin firth is out of the picture up to that point its a fun ride but frankly the whole picture hits an iceberg and sinks deep into the abyss after that smug cocky and secondrate the picture becomes a model of the protagonist before making his journey one is left hoping that the entire affair does not spawn a sequelnegative,the first thing you notice is that females are universally portrayed as the source of good and happy and light and the more effeminate the character the better masculine qualities are invariably associated with greed anger pettiness and violence and the more masculine the character the more corrupt reminded me of elfquest there is a tendency in modern entertainment such as broadways wicked to portray evil by men as internally motivated and evil by women as externally provoked its not her fault she did x it was the only option available to her because of what he did its not that she was powerhungry and caused pain to retain her power shes just misunderstood and once we embrace the feminine superiority the world will be a better place retelling the story would be pointless so i wont include any spoilers what matters is the overarching theme this message is wrapped up in a cacophony of sparkle & wideangle camera work but its still a feminist fantasy in which girls are smarter & stronger than boys the feminine is divine and the masculine must be destroyednegative,the first five minutes of guardians of the galaxy is a hook and gets your teeth sunk in for what looks like a fun creative and quirky ride then after 1015 minutes went by i couldnt help but feel ive seen this exact movie before i had it was a film entitled raiders of the lost ark you may of heard of it if you were to watch the first 10 minutes of each of these films and overlay them you would pretty much be watching the same film so they updated it with a lot of cgi and super heroes because super heroes are the current trend right now of course pepper in a cameo with stan lee right? the movie gets worst from there on out the cgi is over the top the characters are thrown at us with no development at all but with the assumption we are to care about them one minute they are trying to kill each other or not kill each other for some reason why put him in a bag? i dont get it just take the orb then about 60 minutes in the producers decide to blast us with a 2030 minute cgi jack fest that looks just like another film this time they decided to duplicate star wars episode ii not a good film to replicate a space chase with cgi only lucas could love ten million things happening on the screen in the span of one chase scene all while blasting our eyes and our ears with brutally piercing effects your ears will be ringing for 48hrs after seeing this film you might have an epileptic seizure if you try to follow all the action as well this leaves us a little later on with peter quill mysteriously smitten over a girl that he has no connection with that has been established matter of fact he decides to risk his own life to save her and depend on the undesirable to save him sure cue more cgi and miraculous healing a minute later to his face after all he isnt mortal is he? or is he? there is also a tree in the film that walks and conveniently regenerates limbs when handcuffs are needed to be placed on him they have a prison suit that fits a 2 tall raccoon who doesnt know what a raccoon is even though he speaks english but not a prison suit that fits a 8 tree i think this was a case of the cgi department having no problem rendering walking branches instead of a walking rodent the tree has a case of the hodors but not unlike chewbacca he can be completely understood as he speaks articulated sentences except with chewbacca we could infer solo was guesstimating what chewy was saying and having fun with it this is not the case the raccoon actually understands everything the film got so bad that we saw a few people get up and leave about 90 minutes into it we took their cue ten minutes later the person i was with kept looking at me like really?? and left as well the film was an obnoxious capitalistic cgi jack fest that had no story that wasnt stolen from three other high grossing films no character development and no creativity to give you an example of how uncreative it is after ripping off the entire intro to raiders of the lost ark the director i assume tried to pull a song from the reservoir dogs soundtrack and use it to lighten the film in this case hooked on a feeling was used when? when the characters were entering prison of course why of course they were hooked on the feeling of going to prison contrast this with the brilliant work of tarantinos use of the same song in reservoir dogs its like the director never saw reservoir dogs or he had no say in the music used in the film what happened to the clever 70s music to be sprinkled in for comic relief? it just disappeared midway thru the film and didnt return til later they had to have the episode ii cgi jack fest scene to take up half the movie and the pretend romance scene i could go on from there about how bad this movie was but i would have to go back and watch the last thirty minutes maybe after my ears stop ringing and they release the fifth special edition dvd at which point 99 cents will be the going rate for all other versions i might just do that until then ill cross my fingers and hope jj can save the holy trilogy that this film and so many others try to rip off while turning a blind eye its no coincidence that the poster looks exactly like the poster for episode ivnegative,the first few minutes were good and promising however soon unreasonable stupidity took over and the whole thing was swallowed up into just another blockbuster clich_ even if in an unusual packaging lets compare it to transcendence despite its few flaws transcendence depicted a very realistic scenario from beginning to end it was reasonable with its depiction of humans too and remained so throughout not so this one it was made for the masses and the whole premise is stupid the scary thing is that this salivating blockbuster is cheered with a 9 rating while transcendence is written off as something unrealnegative,the first few minutes were good and promising however soon unreasonable stupidity took

where logic just blew away and the worst possible ending appeared so let me summarize a handful of terrorists who killed a lot of people wins against a peaceful superb being that tries to heal the world and they dont just destroy it they try to deceive it using the wife who in 1 second decided to betray her husband the deception fails and the final terrorist girl just waves her gun into the air points to another friend who has betrayed will and just commands kill your fng self and your wife too just so i wont shoot your friend why will doesnt save his wife while simulating death? even better why cant will neutralize one small stupid terrorist girl? how is it he able to get over every other military unit but not this one? cant he use one of his minions to jump fast and furious? cant he attack her from behind? cant he after all just heal his friend? so one stupid terrorist girl makes the world healing machine commit suicide and basically murder his own wife for whom he was doing this all and who betrayed him in no time and without any doubts terrorists win planet loses basically this film is about that if you believe in something so hard that you will kill many people for it and just demand your enemies to kill themselves youll get what you want its about go terrorists go if you think that you are doing good thing its all good the worst possible ending evernegative,the film

the worst possible ending evernegative,the dustbowli didnt understand the usage of old interview footage from survivors of the early dustbowls made no sense corn is the only viable crop? okay i didnt get the whole antiscience apollo faked landings schtick it was irrelevant to the plot in fact the plot points out that science is mans only hope here why indeed have our future selves placed a wormhole next to saturn and not the moon where its more convenient? why cant our future selves if they are so advanced simply contact us directly or show up? why cant they appear in the past when it wasnt too late to save the planet? what was the deal with the barely habitable planets of ice and water and rocks? earth is a jewel yet these places wouldnt support any human populations and indeed they even pale to the dustbowl earth depicted in the movie how is it that weve got advanced enough technologies for ai robots and blackhole venturing spacecraft but we cant save the earth? enters a black hole enters a tesseract of space time and the best he can do is ping a watchs second hand? back to my comment about our future selves right theres only one thing thats rewarding in this movie and its the rather recycled but still fun to watch aspects of the various launches and spacecraft operation yay unfortunately this is a grand total of about 5 minutes of footage the sound in this movie is impressive but at several points it overwhelms the lame dialoguenegative,the creators of this movie had an agenda a were afraid of technology so lets kill it no matter the cost agenda so lets make a movie about it oh and lets spend a lot of money and hire a lot of known faces to spread this agenda and the loopholes in the script wow those loopholes did jdepp and mfreeman even read the script before starting production?? seeing this movie only causes people to resent building an ai to resent progress to resent what the human species has been doing for the past 200k yeasts or so evolving there is nothing wrong in the actions of the ai in this movie only those of the humans trying to stop it eventually causing the humanitys own demisenegative,the buildup to a change from a licentious rich kid to a heroic vigilante was very poorly written the character is not believable in the least a guy spends 5 years on a deserted island struggling for survival yet finds enough time and resources to learn martial arts a foreign language and acrobatics? come on not to mention that he somehow managed to manufacture electronically enhanced arrows and become a hacker you call that believable? really? besides he wants to be a good guy and save the city so he starts by physically attacking his bodyguard and killing people whos only visible crime is working for a mobster some good values there no doubt the other characters are not much better each of them is a stereotype of some kind not a rounded complicated human being in almost every single respect the first episode was one of the worst tv shows ive ever seen i will not watch the second episode honestly i wish i could unwatch the first onenegative,the beginning of the movie was okay and the back story was understandable however trying to make the villain of a classic disney movie into a good guy is infuriating i understand how the directors wanted to make a change but why? there is no point in making a huge change in a classic disney movie for example prince phillip was not at the ceremony as a boy defeating the whole purpose of the main highlight song i know you once upon a dream which did not happen in the movie they met of him asking for directions another thing the fairies flaura fauna and maryweather in the original movie were at least somewhat responsible but in this movie they were the most stupid dimsighted caretakers ive ever seen in the movie they didnt even cast the names not to mention the hilarious cakedress scene they made for auroras 16th birthday aurora never dances with philip which again defeats the whole purpose of the true loves kiss speaking of which the whole true loves kiss scene never happens which makes me want to rip hair out of my head its the whole point of sleeping beauty the whole castle never falls asleep and maleficent awakes aurora with a true loves kiss what? maleficent never turns into a dragon which was the best part of the original movie where the prince slays the evil fairy and saves the princess thats what we want to see basically the only good thing about the movie were the special effects and cgi other than that the whole movie was disappointingnegative,that summary does not mean i find work aimed towards teenagers awful as a rule i dont generalise it simply means its another addition to the genre of teenage fiction which is so poor it deserves to be labelled as tripe in and of itself the divergent series is based on books of the same name which means right from the off many of us who havent read said books knew there would be a devoted fanbase to the series i dont begrudge those fans their opinions and i cant speak for how this movie works as an adaptation what i can do is summarise its effectiveness appeal and overall enjoyability as a standalone piece of cinematography and on the whole i am thoroughly amused in a pitying way the characters have zero appeal because weve seen them all before the deer in the headlights type of teenage lead the heartless and shallow arch enemy and an ensemble of clichs including but not limited to the male warrior and sex appeal the small group of enlightened protagonists the gormless population living under heel etcetera etcetera i had an issue with the distinct lack of originality in the first movie with it bearing notable similarities to huxleys brave new world and orwells 1984 not to mention the more recent hunger games and other pieces of dystopian fiction the point is the movie stands on the work of other successful franchises  whether novels or movies  and allows those series to lay the groundwork for what it portrays as a riproaring fight against tyranny but which is in reality another slugfest of brainless acting numbing action and unoriginal plot points im not going to say anything overly negative against shailene woodley as ive yet to see her in anything but this series but im unimpressed with her acting potential thus far she isnt helped by the poor script and mediocre directing so i wont be too critical but by this stage im not holding my hopes up for an upandcomer in anything beyond typecast roles in future productions the acting of the support cast is what you might expect  an attempt to appeal to the youthful masses and bearing no distinctly original traits of their own in any sense whatsoever the worst part has to be the story the simple motive is if youve seen it in dystopian features youll probably see it in the divergent series the basic structure is flimsy with regards to the castes huxley fans will see what i did there that people are forced to choose and the idea of a rebellion against the oligarchy portrayed is so clichd that it just doesnt hold any interest in fact you might be able to accurately predict the majority of events which transpire in this film and as any moviegoer will tell you that is never a good thing we need originality and we arent given it by any stretch of the imagination action flicks for teenagers need a new format if theyre going to survive i feel and this does nothing to refresh the genre on the contrary its rather like dragging a dead horse into the town square and then repeatedly whipping it for laughs although the only laughs are mine and theyre painful if youre a fan of the novels or someone seeking pointless cinematic thrills you might enjoy this but if you have a refined taste in films or are expecting to see something worth the popcorn i advise you to flee not walk away but literally flee with cheetahlike pace and dont look backnegative,that summary does

computer nerds who have no concept of effective storytelling and put them into a room to make a movie? you get transcendence the whole thing is based on special effects its a film by people who think half of the cameras running at 300 fps is artor something i am so tired of movies where all that matters is how cool it looks the plot was ridiculousat the end of the movie a group of twentysomething guys were exiting ahead of us and one of the guys said that was pretty excellent i thought well i guess its working for its demographic so to everyone involvedgive up your gun toting worldisan illusion horrible filmmaking and go put your money to good uselike film schoolnegative,take the nonsense of inception multiply by about 1000 add some soap opera moments and you get interstellar i dont have to check the spoiler box because there is nothing to spoil or rather there is everythingto spoil but there isnt time enough to call out the instances of bad dialog poor acting lousy hair jobs words strung together that sound interesting but mean nothing contradictions galore real black holes aka plot holes one liners designed to emotionally hook the audience cause there aint no substance visuals to distract cause there aint no substance deus ex machinas as needed and they are too frequently needed etc and so on oh did i mention bad evil mixing? and for those of you whiners about hate no this isnt about hate its about the lack of sound movie making the only sound movie making principle followed isyou get a hap hap happy hollywood ending in sum a shakespearean epitaph is appropriate full of sound and fury signifying nothing ps i did enjoy the music but my bad couldve gotten that for a lot less investment of time and moneynegative,sweet suffering christ  this was an absolute howler  god only knows why mm got involved as i thought he was on the up  ok its supposed to be scifi and im all for a wee trip through a wormhole with a return leg through a black hole only to be picked up by the local taxi that was orbiting saturn  this garbage should have been left in a toilet hole  north korea has more street cred than this  ive had more fun scraping dogturd from the deep grooves of my walking boots  i cant believe that a movie that got you to sign up for almost 3 hours could be so consistently pathetic with no redeeming story lines  this stunk more than an overflowing greek beach toilet at the height of summernegative,spoilers i sacrificed myself by entering a black hole in my spacesuit endured a lsd trip of love to send you this singular message not for me but for the good of mankind this is a movie which literally gets worse by the minute should your cinema be graceful and insert a break use it get out the rest of this thing will seem to last 7 years youll probably realized the heartwarming end to it already anyway apparently mankind was able to master robotics and an ai worthy of star trek but still uses current spaceships except when they dont somewhat later cause you know it just wouldnt have worked with all that landing and launching on other planets also it wouldnt have been impossible to send probes to the planets because  well that wasnt in the script either it was however possible to think that a planet orbiting a gigantic black hole so close to its event horizon that one hour stretches to seven years might be a hospitable place to found a new civilization apart from all that nonsense reality like being sucked into it or getting grilled by gamma rays so i have wasted several hours and even some minutes more to write this but if it saves one soul from enduring this negative,spoilers are added in my short review  well  its hard to describe what i watched about an hour ago  ive read the books  of course they are not something special or brilliant but they can perfectly take place in the list of enjoyable ones  i was shocked how much the director has changed the plot of the books and the way that the main characters should be presented in this movie  one word dissapointment   somehow i lost the connection with the whole atmosphere in the middle of the movie  it felt like it is a different story that was missing something  dont know why but the performance of shailene didnt work for me this time  her pretty face just ruined everything that i imagined as a strong and tough character in insurgent   a lot of the key moments in the book were gone and for the readers especially it was not that much of a satisfaction   the second part of the movie was a total disaster  i cant believe how the writer agreed for such a dramatic change in the plot  while sitting and watching the movie i was so inpatient to see the final battle  the emotional conclusion  the way jeanine should have died but the thrill suddenly disappeared after a few scenes   what was that with the box ? some kind of joke or what ? i cant imagine what is gonna be the next movie allegiant and im not sure if im gonna watch it but probably it will be something far away from the real story  the only pros of insurgent were the great cinematography and visual effects supported with not that bad soundtrack   negative,spoiler? just describing the first scene i sit down with my ten year old expecting to be entertained heard so much about this movie its this generations star wars right? first scene a tragic heartjerker that kills off the kids mother what the  who asked for this? i hold my kids hand and we plunge on then a bunch of running around and dumb violence about the time somebody for some reason who claims his father had been killed and his grandfather takes a big hammer and smashes someones head so blood can trickle down into this reservoir my kid and i looked at each other and said are you enjoying this at all? of course not so we left maybe it gets fun and charming after half an hour but honestly this is todays entertainment???negative,spoiler alert i cant believe that there are so many glowing reviews of this movie on the plus side brilliant cg fx cinematography on the negative side the awful acting the terrible plot the script the hokey comic book physics explained for the lowest common denominator in the audience i really liked mcconaughey in dallas buyers club  by far the best thing hes done to date but in this movie? just another flybythe seatofthepants astronaut risking everything and everyone but it all works out in the end of course way too much time at the start of the movie setting up the ending which came as no surprise whatsoever thanks to the ghost and then we discover that love conquers all including science of course probably most of the reason i rated this so low is because with a name like interstellar i was expecting way too much depth on the intricacies of theoretical interstellar travel the time relativity concept et al sigh and the smartass wisecracking robot was the last straw just so badnegative,spoiler alert and warning they were lobbing fbombs at you on par with the quantity in the die hard movies they used the bait and switch method of advertising in their trailer the trailer would have you believe colin firth saved a kid from the streets as in obi wan and luke skywalker agent kay and agent jay enders game etc you see that trailer and that is what you are expecting then you get in there and a lot more cursing is going on than you expected then the last scene in the movie is graphic anal sex is this the best you can do after 100 years of cinematography? crude for the sake of it the man sitting next to me got up and left shortly before the end of the movie i thought surely it cant be that much longer he couldnt wait to go to the rest room he never came back i guess hed been warned about the last scene being so vulgar i wish id read the reviews before i went so i would have left when he did or not gone at all im so tired of cgi newsflash movie makers real people cant fly sideways for 20 feet i will be finding out who made this movie and i will be making sure not to try anything else of theirs until it is so old it has been reviewed to within an inch of its life so ill know of any vulgarities so i can decide for myself and not have it sprung on me with no warningnegative,sometimes i do not get the ratings at all on the site this film was without a doubt the most overrated film i have ever seen and that is saying a lot since i have been an avid film watcher for 60 years i am used to comic based films as being somewhat thin on the depth of plot lack of character development i suppose one is expected to be a comic reader to fill in the gapsi am not and filled with a plenitude of special effects to wow the audience taking their attention away from the actual film not being that good that said at least a newbie to the story line of the comic book being portrayed can get some minimal entertainment from the film genre this film did not even provide that i was embarrassed for the actors who apparently knew only two degrees of acting recite the lines with no emotional involvement or overact every single line from the simplest to the more emotionally complex of which there were few it was painful for me to see the art so debased the dialog itself was sophomoric and clichd requiring only a third grade education to comprehend the film editing subtracted more than it added to the film while there was much action in the film the editing jumped too quickly between different shots of the action to get anything more than a vague sense that something was happening with no real sense of the specifics of the action all in all at $170000000 marvel could and should have done something to engage more than a superficial response in their audience  which began and ended with opening their wallets to pay to see this $170000000 travesty i gave it 2 stars only because of the films budget and took away 8 because it proves that spending that kind of money still cannot create a film with any redeeming social or intellectual value whatsoevernegative,sometimes i do not get the ratings at all on the site this film was without a doubt the most overrated film i have ever seen and that is

redeeming social or intellectual value whatsoevernegative,someone who claims to have enjoyed this mess might like to attempt a brief summary of the plot not omitting as the film did why these boring people were doing what they were possibly the only really effective scene is simply lifted from jules dassins `topkapi but the actor holding the rope in this version is nowhere near as interesting as peter ustinov in the original perhaps the silliest effect in motion picture history  the entire traininthechunnel sequence is completely incredible  occurs where the cruse character throws himself back on the tgv using the explosion of the helicopter see fellows the human cannonball at the circus is faked human bodies are destroyed not harmlessly transported by explosions mmle beart however is worth rememberingnegative,so the only selling point of this movie is that it was filmed over 12 years wow yeah crazy you know what else happened over a period of 12 years? lots of nothing to lots of other people just like in this movie in which nothing freaking happens 12 years and this is what they came up with? for crying out loud this movie is less interesting than watching paint dry in the middle of an arkansas corn field for 12 years maybe my lifes so much more interesting than everyone elses who gave this movie rave reviews are people so boring that its now cool to pay to watch nothing happen on a screen? and the guy is gay didnt anyone else notice that? ive nothing against gay people but were supposed to believe hes straight come on if thatd been acknowledged at least there might have been something interesting there look hes finally coming out of the closet shocker and what did these people have against hair brushes? maybe its too much excitement to brush your hair and it might have given the movie an air of something actually happening a hint of not so awfullyboringwhygoddidiagreetowatchthis? i want a refundnegative,so the big movie of the yearthe big thinker even came up on 9gag asking is this possible i got excited oh boywas i wrong the movie is just terrible they are just throwing that space terminology around like potatoes and people think yea this is smart movie very insightful and out of the box thinking and smart and stephen hawking theorylike way of describing something the people that sayit is great and i got the movie are just arrogant 323i4h5 trying to look intelligent a lot of corners left for questioning and i hate the movie where i watch and ask out loud why the duck did you do that or why the duck didnt you say that when it is obvious it needs more explaining it all is based on us accepting some facts that they say in the movie only because they use few scientific concepts like neutron stars spinning black holes and time dilation but the rest is just pure guessing and in a bad way looks like nolan wanted to try and give it a shot and in 100 years if he got it right people will sayyea there was some guy nolan the producer and he was talking about this in the 2015but i doubt it i gave review for only two movies on imdb this one and batman dark knight risesboth same crap or maybe i am just oblivious and dumb for all of the people giving 88 on imdbnegative,so disney ambushes gregory maguire the author of wicked in this tepid retelling of sleeping beauty and the unnecessary explanation for the actions of the exquisite villain we love to hate maleficent maguire had a brilliant idea once upon a time his speculation about a wicked womans progression towards very bad behavior and the reasons behind that transformation changed fairy tales forever maguire caught lightening in a bottle using complex characters and situations to explain a life that ended with a bucket of water wicked had everything that maleficent does not compelling characters and a sturdy plot which gave the characters room to move and grow maleficent is the dollar general version of wicked for its tedious running time of 90some minutes it plods along throwing 200 million dollars of cgi imagery at you which is evidently supposed to divert you from noticing the plot holes and jawdroppingly abysmal dialog it feels padded out in many places its stingy in the extreme and comes across like a puppy thats peed on the carpet you cant hate a puppy all cuteness and earnest contrition for the wet spot maleficent wants your love so badly its willing to humiliate the best villain disney ever had we love maleficent simply because shes bad to the bone why should we care what happened to her back in the day? great villains are often just what they appear to be corrupt individuals who take pleasure in the suffering of others the original maleficent owned her darkness and in the end died for it this new terrible explanation for old mals bitchery was given to us by the horrid linda woolvertons screenplay woolverton also scribbled the wretched screenplay for tim burtons alice in wonderland this reimagining of why the old girl was such a meanie nearly turns disneys grande dame of evil into june cleaver all that was missing was a string of everyday pearls and a frilly apron lets not talk about the three fairies or the weak retelling of the famous pinkblue fight between them i wanted to spray them with raid and watch them die now thats evil evidently the backbone disney showed in 1959 allowing maleficent to invoke all the powers of hell in her dragon transformation is all gone being a real meanie is bad these days no one is accountable for doing bad things theyre just misunderstood being a meanie doesnt sell merchandise being a meanie and dying when you finally get caught doesnt allow for a sequel get ready for maleficent 2 forest frolics two stars one for each of angelina jolies cheekbone prosthetics a truly depressing film from a once innovative studionegative,so  i was yesterday to see this big movie which has a rating of 87 close to the lord of the rings movies the same as matrix or inception and even better than seven or usual suspects it should be good right? doesnt matter that marvel made only crap movies most of them anyway with a few exceptions some of the first spiderman movies and some xmen movies maybe they nailed it this time so the movie starts and after the first scenes we see our hero on an abandoned planet dancing as he goes to collect the item he came for he is not thinking that while he is listening music at his headset someone may be nearby anyway he got what he came for and the scene is very similar to the one in indiana jones no surprise this entire movie is a rip off of other movies you have you hero which is a smuggler and becomes one of the good guys star wars you have a pair a raccoon and a tree only the raccoon understands the tree star wars again our hero out of the nowhere falls in love with the femaleagain star wars only in star wars the process was more real and more fun also like other marvel movies the characters do illogical actions in the most important moments gomora after she fights to the death with her sister trying to cut the power tries to save her when her sister was holding on the edge of the ship while peter quill and the others were waiting for gomora to cut the damn power another stupid moment was when ronan at last he lands but he doesnt destroy the planet the thing he wanted the most to do no he looks at our hero dancing speechless and how did drax survived when he and ronan are hit by a ship at full speed piloted by raccoon? so guardians of the galaxy is a movie full of meaningless special effects explosions after explosions characters that are poorly written actors that dont act very well a poor script and ideas borrowed from other movies conclusion another boring movie by marvel highly over rated i dont know how i think marvel fans are overzealous or the people are just getting dumber day by day you wanna see a good scifi movie watch any of the star wars moviesnegative,should not be called a disney film  the original was fine angelina jolie was better in changeling a much more believable and oscarworthy role several of the actors did a bad job the guy playing the king was especially horrible elle fanning was annoying with her widerimmed smile they turned the three fairies everyone loved into completely hideous idiots bordering on child abuse almost all the characters were onedimensional and uninteresting and how was it that aurora didnt cry when her father died? why didnt anyone see the one of the magical trees at the beginning of the film totally resemble the balrog from fellowship of the ring??? ugh i wish this film could be erased from existence 210  a 2 for the nice effects but the story is overall badly flawed and tries with unsuccessful efforts to shatter categoriesnegative,seriously? some people are rating this 10? im no physicist but i do have a basic understanding of what is within the realms of possibility firstly the first line of the synopsis of this film on imdb scarcity of food on planet earth due to drought and famine? what? sorrybut no on our planet we are currently storing seeds in a massive archive from countries all over the world even north korea theyre being stored underground and kept at a very low temperature also we can grow vegetation without sunlight there are many people doing this today so why if for any reason would we be risking our crops to this unexplained environment? this is just the first problem i have with this film at no point was it explained of what the cause of this global famine was i want to know and i waited for 3 hours for an explanation that never came secondly forgoing the wormhole if gravity is that strong to slow down time youd be crushed and waves wouldnt even exist let alone 100 foot waves thirdly the robot why oh why is it a box that seemingly can move over any terrain? throughout the film the same joke humour level at 75%? sarcasm rating at 80%? oh yes these jokes came thick and fast the only joke i could see is that this film was actually made and i wasted 3 hours of my life if you want to watch a brilliant sci fi with matthew maconaghy watch contact it was made in 1997 and was written by the famous cosmologist carl sagan now thats worthy of a 10 the only good point about interstellar was the visuals married to the brilliant soundtrack if you want that then go to a light show or concert sad to say im greatly disappointed nolan should stick with bat mannegative,seldom has there been a film where the critics opinions and its true quality diverge so seriously boyhood is empty because it lacks content and form it celebrates the ordinary and mediocrity instead of aiming at something extraordinary as a result it embraces nothingness and is in that sense deeply nihilistic and even depressing anybody with the same camera and some actors could have made this movie or more likely a better one those who praise the film always point out the same circumstance the only thing they can say which is this film is like real life i have to say this is true on the most superficial level imaginable but i may ask is that a good thing? is this if film history has taught us anything what a film should be? real life according to linklater means a lifespan during which nothing happens the boyhoodexperience is the equivalent of your experience waiting in line at the supermarket yes this is the real life linklater presents us nothing happens in this movie nothing no story no interesting characters just ordinary situations from real life of course there are films in which nothing or very little happens and they can be great tarkovskys mirror antonionis lavventura or tarrs the turin horse come to my mind but you need ideas you got that linklater? you need a style or form which cannot be separated from the content you need a capable director that can create a form of visual communication boyhood offers none of those things the film gets praised especially by those who have never seen an arthouse movie and mistake it for an art film people are misled so easily boyhood is pure blankness shallowness superficiality nothingness to praise boyhood as a masterpiece is actually a slap in the face of all those directors who put a real effort into creating works of art that have real value boyhood is in fact an antifilm in the sense that it stands against everything film should be  be it an artistic masterpiece or just an entertaining fun movie the film is neither a work of art nor entertaining in that regard it can be called a nonfilm it celebrates its own nonexistence and drowns in its nihilism i doubt this was linklaters intention but it certainly is the result of what he created be warned this is not a drama the movie is the opposite of a carefully constructed work of art its nothing but a reenactment of memories a collection of unmeaning scenes we may or may not know from our own lives bowling playing video games reading harry potter etc i think it is only fair to ask what is the point? i went to see this film having high hopes and having read all the raving reviews expecting a masterpiece from richard linklater the director of the great waking life i liked the trailer which makes the movie look much more interesting than it actually is actually everything that happens in the movie is already in the trailer the basic idea of filming a boy growing into a young man during twelve years is interesting yes but sadly the film offers nothing more than that this is not enough sadly many critics seem to have liked the basic idea so much that to them it didnt even matter if the director would be able to make it interesting or not the film which is much too long follows an unstable family and focuses on the life of mason a character that has absolutely no interesting characteristics whatsoever the intelligent viewer will be unable to connect with such a person mason walks through this film as if he was in a coma or half asleep he has no ambitions at some point he gets his first kiss gets interested in photography the ultimate art form for unimaginative lazy people during high school havent we seen that already too many times? goes to college at which point the film ends i kid you not this is the whole movie the mother becomes a teacher at a local college and always seems to attract the wrong guys the father is an unemployed loser who only talks about pop music and ends up being a square masons sister the directors daughter grows up too and thats pretty much all you can say about her it is actually impossible to spoil this film because nothing happens unless you consider the fact that mason finishes high school a spoiler linklater completely fails to dramatize his ideas as a result following this movie feels like watching family home videos of a family you do not care about  just with better picture quality instead of using form or contentdrama to make the film interesting boyhood refuses to do just that and therefore remains superficial you dont get to the essence of real life by only showing the surface of things everybody could do that it is really hard talking about this film because there isnt a single interesting character or scene in it you just follow ordinary events in the lives of these people stay away from this movie yes this review will get negative votes just because i didnt like the film unlike the critics union well none of those critics were able to offer a single insightful argument that would speak for this nonmovie in fact many even admitted the film lacked interesting characters or style but because of the 12yeargimmik they call it a masterpiece give me a break i would be willing to debate any of these pseudointelligent critics and tear them into pieces over and outnegative,script 010 acting 110 dialogues 010 characters 010 environment110 special effects 010 marketing 1010 all those positive reviews are fake this movie is nothing but a good marketing campaign the first two hours were so boring that people started leaving the cinema apart from the giant wave at the end of the film there are no other special effects the robot is so primitive that you want to cry the director of this movie is hopeless just watch the ad on youtube and it will be enough entertainment for the poor and tastelessnegative,science fiction fans dont need everything spelling out for them thats why the narration was removed from blade runner thats why 2001 a space odyssey has no dialogue in its opening and closing twenty minutes thats why r2d2 doesnt speak english and then theres interstellar matthew mcconaughey even takes the time to explain the origin of his daughters name to his daughters face this blunt method of explaining murphys law to the audience is just one example of the unnecessary exposition which interstellars running time is so bloated by it is also the first of many inferior echoes of contact in contact james woods explains occams razor in a similar fashion however it is justified by the court of law context in which the scene takes place more significantly however is the lifting of a major theme from contact in which jodie foster never fully moves on from the loss of her father jessica chastains character here does likewise only without the emotional resonance because she is so bitter that its hard to sympathise with her the other female character in interstellar yeah theres only two also spends all her screen time pining after a man feminists  stay away another silly moment is the shot for shot homage to event horizon yes there really is a direct lift from event horizon this is where one scientist explains to another scientist what a wormhole is which is like a driving instructor explaining to another driving instructor what biting point is it wouldnt happen like ever at least when sam neil gave the low down on wormholes in event horizon he was addressing blue collar workers so it was once again justified by context perhaps the goofiest thing in the whole film is tars a computer with delusions of being the next hal 9000 which is actually nothing more than metallic origami have i mentioned it knows a joke? yeah it has been programmed with one joke and it uses this joke many times the joke is that humour is quantifiable by percentage why watch this when you can watch contact 2001 a space odyssey or silent running? why go for christopher nolans take on dust bowl migration when you can read john steinbecks instead? on a positive note there are some cool graphics to look at you know like the cool graphics in the hobbit or transformersnegative,scene a semidarkened meeting room some people with dark robes are sitting around a table chairman ok people i present to you this years insult to human consciousness and spirit  this time in movie form you know we have popular hit music we have mainstream news socalled moviestars but we need a more open and direct insult to worthless masses as you know these masses are nothing more than viruses wait lets also use this line in the movie robed character #1 noted chairman good also dont forget to mention how we use tabloid news for communicating by the way feed the tinfoil cap trolls on international forums let them produce more disrespect and ridicule for truth seekers lately more people seem to be able to read symbols rc #2 can they understand that we ridicule them in plain sight once this movie is released? ch what? are you kidding? they still believe official stories for everything lets release this movie and youll see how many people will say hey this is great fun to watch people kill each other violently in blood fest humanity deserves wars and torture people the have no real respect for each other and for life did i say theyre like viruses? rc #1 yes master well add this line to the movienegative,save yourself the time with this one unless your less than about 12 years old or have a very low iq its like the ideas been pieced together from other shows its stupid inconsistent hypocritical ridiculous and most of the acting is terrible its a pity because the underlying story with the mother and her associates is the shows only redemption you just have to sit through the agony of the rest of the show to get this maybe they should save us all the heartache and just tell us what happens with that story linenegative,save your money and your time except that the cgi moments were great but were better done in the new cosmos tv series and the film gravity this film at nearly every level of filmmaking was boring this certainly would be true if you have no interest whatsoever in science fiction or fact i had problems enjoying this film on several levels 1 the annoying musical  never seemed to fit the moment bombastic 2 the overthetop soap operatype melodrama all characters it seemed carried an unlimited supply of angst and tears 3 the irritation of trying to hear the actors mumble inane dialogue especially michael caine 4 burning corn fields look like iraq oil fields on fire 5 after 23 years the watch left on the bookshelf still ticking and evidently keeping time 6 chasing speeding drone through cornfield with a flat tire all with a smooth ride 7 hollywood wildwesttype manomano fistfight between damon & mcconaughey in air tight space suits through a worm hole on an ice planet in another galaxy far far away 8 midway and unexplained appearance of the topher grace character 9 sets and props often looked like they were borrowed from ancient tv show twlilight zone 10 absolutely zilch onscreen chemistry among actors 11 poor ellen burstyn looking so artificial in all that heavy latex and make up i quit you get the picture of this picture awfulnegative,rented this movie over the weekend after oscar nominations and reading reviews etc i think the appeal of this movie begins and ends with the fact that linklater made a project of filming his daughteractress for 12 years in what appears to be very self indulgent and opportunistic i cant understand how an actual documentary like hoop dreams gets snubbed not too mention selmas director getting snubbed but this nearly 3 hour marathon receives nothing but accolades from the academy the novelty of watching the family physically grow for 12 years is about as interesting as it sounds you watch them physically grow thats it thats the big wow factor of the film id of preferred to watch grass grow actually the acting and scenes seem forced and i couldnt figure out if he was trying to make us believe this was a documentary? a documentary would have been soooo much more interesting and entertaining mason the sons character never really evolves the clich single mom who makes bad choices when it comes to men has been done before keep in mind this is not a documentary this is a moviestory i couldnt help but think to myself while watching this film that i know several families and individuals that have actual interesting and compelling true life stories that make this film look ridiculous i mean mason gets called a slur in a bathroom? oooh masons first alcoholic step dad makes him cut his hair without even asking? a commentary on the banality of life is what this movie amounts to for me? clearly im in the minority as most seemed to have enjoyed the film i dont see the originality excellence in acting directing etc outside of using the same actors for 12 years one of which is the directors daughternegative,rented this movie over the weekend after oscar nominations

the big question is why? as a film in its own right its not terrible but comparing it to the original it literally pales in comparison despite being a liveaction rip why did we need this  sure on some level it may reach those who havent seen the original and dont want to watch an old anime but really  why should we indulge the multiplexers who refuse to watch anything made before 2005? its not bad  its poor a poor relation of the original in the uk we often get 50th anniversary etc rereleases of old films nationwide admittedly not in all cinemas in fact cinderella monogatari was out a few years ago so the idea that a cheap copy is good because itll help open it up to new audiences the cast are all ok  until you watch the original anime overall its soso as a film however when you compare it to the original its really a poor show and because its a carbon copy you cant help but compare it line for line scene for scene actor for actornegative,remakes are regular things nowadays but carbon

line scene for scene actor for actornegative,really without details dont waste your money i saw this movie in imax and really there is nothing good in this movie picture 1* sound philip glass from watchman 10* ?* story 2* way the story is given to us 10* logical error 100* really i love quantum theory but pointing logical errors i dont refer to quantum theory this movie is simply a 3h of melodrama  1h about the food is ending?? imagine the the day after tomorrow with the 1h intro about deadly force of cold  in one part of the movie the two people are traveling on foot faster than starship that is send after them   you can catch the drone by laptop when you driving a old car but you cant stop space ship having 2 supercomputers  apparently in the future gta is no problem because even the hangars do not have security?? no wait you have to use card and thats all the fly control  and the crew is sleeping?? there is plenty of others logical errors that cant let you watch the move so dont waste your money  you were warnednegative,really flynn? you treat your customers of your art like this? so bad empty no sense no closure just brutal way to treat us you are writing to entertain do that dont punish us with an ending you just cant figure out on your own  hire help im sure stephen king or dan brown could have given you a better ending  no charge the story moved along nice and you had me but the twist  it was good i think the hole in the script was the couple that stole money from amy they would have gone to the press probably sold their story once they realized who they stole money from i mean those kind of characters always do that? i actually thought thats what you would do wrong instead you killed 25 hours of my life plus another 10 minutes writing this dribble next time im reading spoilers for any of your stories to make sure i dont waste any more timenegative,real life well yes for this boring persons and heroes of this movie life is here that is for sure but life that really should not be meant for anybody as you can see that heroes of the movie are bored with their every day life and if that was intention than they really nailed it but then again why watch it what is the purpose in making movie about completely regular life of one functional but boring family at the end of the movie i started to value my time only because i lost three hours spending time with this people while i could have spent it on my people and again if this was purpose of the movie then again great job as i am going with my family now and we will have some joy and happiness so totally opposite then this and who nows maybe we will record things on video from now on and we will maybe make more enjoying life movie with heroes getting older and with no budget at all i wondernegative,reading the other reviews here its hard to conceive that i watched the same movie everyone is gushing about the central premise is hardly noble although perhaps quite the likely selfish outcome ie after trashing this planet lets go trash some others the black hole visualizations were quite lame this is not a great scifi film even remotely in the league of 2001 although a cursory superficial viewing might suggest so to an unthinking nonscifi buff a great scifi film would naturally start by 1st adapting a great scifi story these are yet to be made such as ringworld dyson spheres and fleet of worlds concepts to think that all these mind boggling stories exist yet this rather old and tired story concept is chosen to lavish money on is strange although it is somewhat understandable as the aforementioned stories would be much greater challenges all around and so its best that they are ignored rather than poorly realized as this primarily propaganda piecenegative,quite frankly one of the worst movies ive ever sat through forget the length forget the plot forget the acting the story was so far fetched and actually insulted the intelligence of the paying viewers this movie isnt even worthy of a review the acting was terrible across the board with the exception of rosamund pike even neil patrick harris was terrible ben affleck has some talent but ive never seen an actors talent meter swing so radically from one side to the other theres no redeeming value or consistency in anything affleck does those of you that are digging deep and sharing your views of the brilliance of this movie need to have a reality checknegative,probably the worst movie i ever seen ive just logged in to imdb to write this review i cant believe that this movie is on the top 250 top 250 of worst movies probably is the right list for this not into fantasy movies in general but there are some limits i didnt realize that there was any plot at all just some random scenes all around a galaxy its really sad that i cant vote 0 out of 10 regarding visual effects the picture was really nice and served in 3d but this was the only plus side of the whole experience boring trying hard to be fun but wasnt really and amuse a popcorn audience well hope we will not have a sequel for this nice wasted 2 hours of a sunday evening hope i will not see another  artwork like this in the near future i cant understand why the expendables are not on top of this movie its a crap title as well that should be popularnegative,pretty much all movies which i ever liked are highly rated on imdb although not all highly rated movies on imdb are movies which i like and this is one of them the movie was shot over many years and this is its main selling point cool thats it nothing else it was a clich scene after clich scene for almost three hours three hours which ill never get back  id rate it with negative 3 but theres no rating lower than 1 sometimes a movie starts bad it goes on for a while but then at the end something new and unique happens and you think oh i totally did not expect that so it was worth seeing it well not now bad start middle and end oh he met another girl really they like each other? is this how people who like each other act? the acting was so poor and just about every line said was said in so unnatural way real people in real situations simply do not look like or act like that i felt no attachment of any kind to any of the characters none of them seemed to have any social skills none of the characters has done anything worth mentioning in all their lives they had some failed attempts for deep and meaningful conversations the plot for such conversations goes like blah blah life blah blah meaning blah blah now be impressed with how much we said blah blahnegative,pretty much all movies which i ever liked are highly rated on imdb although not all highly rated movies on imdb are movies which i like and this is one of them

the mom of the tobis looked young enough to be his sister the leading female actor was the wrong person for the role she did not portray a rough and tough charactershe was just a pretty girl with the perfect eyelashes after a fight scene if you have not seen the first movie of this series do not go see this movie you will not under7stand what is happening and why you will be lost the movie also did not seem like 3d movie do not waste your money on this movie wait till it comes out on dvd trust me you will thank me for the advice duanenegative,please save yourself 3 hours of your life and read this before you watch this movie im sorry to those who want to say this was a profound moviei feel sorry for you this by far was one of the most unimaginative movies i have seen ever the continues praise of how real this movie is really? if i wanted to watch reality i watch a documentary there is a reason why we have documentaries and why we have movies this was not entertaining thought provoking or even remotely imaginative yes it took 12 years to make so what? i mean they had 12 years to think of a story? or give some meat to these actors to chew on i dont understand how there are so many awards and nominations this movie is getting its as if people who watch movies and who are suppose to be critics forgotten what a movie is suppose to be or how to be critical im not a critic but i have spent years and years watching movies and i can tell the difference between whats good and whats not whats art and whats sh*t rolled in glitter let me break it down story = none acting = uninspiring shallow character = one dimensional cinematography = point and shoot directing = great imaginative writing = none existent if a movie has no story no real depth in character or breaking boundaries in cinematic techniques then its not a good movie i do appreciate the fact that this is a unique movie in terms of its actual built but in terms of a movie no i didnt feel a second of inspiration when watching it and now feeling angry that its taken 3 hours of my life this years movies have been the worst in years at lease the positive side of things is at least it wont take me long to forget this movienegative,please dont waste your time or money on this hypedup piece of garbage i dont think ive ever been as disappointed in an ending not that the beginning and middle were all that great as i was with this stupid illogical movie the only spoiler i have is one of the biggest plot fails ever shes escaped her captor by slitting his thread shes virtually covered with blood and the hospital simply allows her to go home where she coyly showers it off totally amazing that this movie has gotten the positive press and reviews it has received  if this doesnt make you realize how incredible hollywood hypemarketing system is at distorting reality nothing will i only wish i could give it a zeronegative,please do not waste your time or money on this nonsense oh boy where do i start ok for me the worst thing is when she gets back and tells everyone that neil patrick harris kidnapped her rosamund he did this by bludgeoning her and she lost a large amount of blood which he cleaned up then he takes her diary to her husbands fathers house to burn how does he even know of this location?????? but he makes such a p$$ poor attempt to burn it which would take 5 min to do properly as opposed to the 30+ to clean the blood and no one questions this even once no one even looks for any wounds or asks about her wellbeing and she is not treated for any wounds oh and the hospital sends her home covered i mean a copious amount blood no flipping way the hospital would clean her looking for wounds especially with this much bloodi could go on and on but just read the other truthful reviews they will point out most of the other glaring mistakes and downright intelligence insulting nonsense i really wish imdb would have a 0 or negative review number as this does not even rank a 1 i give this 5 for utter bull$h1*negative,parents dont let your kids to see this movie it is a brain wash action to show evil is good and humans are bad maleficent it says is a fairy but she is looking nothing like one she is projected to be a demon and the images with her above clouds with black wings and huge horns trying to really brain wash people she is not a angel or a fairy most of the fairy creatures from the movie are ugly and same as the bad actress angelina are evil the movie is not pg should be pg13 at least someone or many are trying to change perspective of kids and kill the innocence dont be fooled by the special effects see behind the scene before is too late if is not alreadynegative,overall the movie was ok and i dont regret watching it it was entertaining and beautifully shot even if many scenes were referential to other movies as for the acting elle fanning was ok as aurora though the character felt a bit empty but to be fair there wasnt much in the script to work with i wish she had a little more to her than childish goodness there actually wasnt much for any of the actors to work with i wont lie im no fan of jolies acting she comes across as haughty in every role humility and vulnerability are completely outside her range but her haughtiness works here and she was good as maleficent except in the scenes where she was supposed to be angry i got no hint of her anger fire or passion she was merely shouting i wanted to feel her rage biggest problem with the movie is the number of plot holes there is no real explanation given for why the moors and the kingdom of men are enemies the king decides to attack for virtually no reason the relationship between stefan and maleficent is graced over and yet this relationship goes to the core of maleficents being we also see nothing of stefans life so we are unable to fully understand his actions and motivations stefan becomes mad and paranoid with no real love for his daughter and that just sort of happens i could go on and on about things left with little explanation another major problem i had was the previews of the movie lied to me in a big way the movie wasnt a retelling of sleeping beauty from mealficents point of view it was an entirely new story i wanted to find out why maleficent was evil  the maleficent i know and lovehate or hatelove i wanted to see maleficents evil with new understanding lets face it maleficent was nowhere near evil in this movie shes angry for a moment and thats it which lead me to imagine other ways to tell the story perhaps humans had seriously wronged her aurora was the child born to unite the 2 warring kingdoms of men and that maleficents plan was to stop this union for real substantial reasons  the story could have been easily told with a new perspective while being seamlessly woven into the known fairy tale every story has two sides right? in conclusion i wouldnt recommend this movie if they were going to deviate so much from the known disney or perrault version they could have fleshed out the story a little lot morenegative,oscars coming up next month  which nominee do i wish to see??? after much debate with my wife and friends we decide on boyhood flashback 11 years oscars coming up next month  which nominee do i wish to see??? after much debate with my wife and friends we decide on lost in translation back to present im sitting here recalling the two worst movie decisions of my life craziest thing would be if boyhood actually wins best picture ha as we all watched our backsides getting numb we occasionally exchanged puzzled looks at each other as if to say what the heck is going on here? the movie much like its 11 year old predecessor made all of us ask how could we all be so different from the critics that raved about this movie its only claim to fame appears to be that it took so many years to film it duh we have things nowadays in hollywood called make up and multiple actors that pull off time changes with no problem  just look at benjamin button ive seen better hidden camera performances than this scripted documentary displayed i would believe that the director didnt have to say action hed just say act normally mason and nicole have a great little chuckle at the end of the movie they know what they just pulled off what a waste of time 35mm and moneynegative,one of the worst movies ever painful for ridiculously drugged out people or those lacking any knowledge whatsoever take your pick overacted and pretentious moronic actors using big words with a total lack of understanding of what they mean i never want to see anne hathaway again ever i only want to see mcconaughey was even worse if that is possible i feel sorry for the actors who played small parts in this movie i formerly had respect for most of them some of the pictures were pretty cool too bad the dialog didnt rise to the level of the cinematography but neither did the storyline the characters were not fully developed in the story it was sillynegative,one of the most ridiculous spectacles of bad storytelling i have ever seen in my entire life gone girl gets its title i think from the fact that she was supposed to be done away with murdered and disposed of but is really gone psychologicallyãshe is a pure psychopath the movie tries to tell you that she is highly intelligent and meticulously plans to fake her own murder and frame her husband for it heres the pathetic execution of her plan 1 he leaves the house one morning and she springs into action 2 she breaks the glass coffee table pours about a half quart of her own blood in one puddle in front of the kitchen sink that much blood from a violent attack would be all over the room 3 she flees leaving the front door open 4 a nosy neighbor notices the door ajar and calls the husband somehow the neighbor knows exactly where he is but no one saw the wife leave 5 the husband comes home he has not a scratch on him 6 he is totally cooperative with the police 7 they eventually find her diary in a wood stove at the husbands fathers house the wood stove door is ajar and the diary is only partially burned it really makes you wonder how that played outãthat the husband put the diary in there to burn but just left it singed all that work cleaning up the blood at home but not to burn the book as if he needed to make a special trip to his dads house to dispose of a stupid book and the only thing incriminating that she wrote was on one page which he couldve simply torn out 8 when the wife runs away she only changes her appearance slightly and then instead of secluding herself she makes friends with some lowlifes with whom she sits and watches her story unfold on tv 9 she murders the neil harris character in an attempt to switch the blame to him that would then imply he was the one that drained so much blood from her back at her home he cleaned it up and he put her diary in the wood stove ? his car wasnt seen at her house he then kept her a prisoner starved and raped heryet she found the opportunity and strength to kill him but didnt call the police from his house to come rescue her rather she jumps in his car and drives all the way home 10 upon returning home she has no wounds consistent with the bloodletting at her original house or at the hands of her alleged kidnapper 11 there is no visit to or investigation of the alleged kidnapping crime sceneãhouse on the lake 12 the hospital sends her home in a nurses uniform underneath which she is still caked in blood this movie is just about the lamest piece of s**** i have ever seennegative,one of the lamest most unconvincing pieces of video material ive been subjected to my stepson said it was good so i gave it a try its shite ive loved comics since early childhood so its another reason why i thought this would appeal to me its so repugnantly fake im at a loss for words youll be hardpressed to find a moment where you can get immersed and forget that its obnoxious actors on screen that youre watching i just dont know what else to add except to speculate what made it receive 82 rating from the audience women drooling over the protagonist? kids into parkour and commercial tunes? im bafflednegative,one big disappointment i kinda liked divergent but insurgent tries way to hard to be the next hunger games the movie doesnt have a good story line and the acting performances of all the young actors was very bad especially shailene woodleys performance was unbelievably bad this movie tries way to hard to be the next hunger games but it fails at each part bad storyline bad acting and an uninteresting story is why i see this film as a big disappointment if you liked the hunger games you better wait until the next hunger games arrives in november sorry divergent fans but insurgent isnt going to be the movie of the yearnegative,omg this movie was so stupid like really waist of timei even pulled out my cell phone and browsed fb while it was playing because of how stupid this movie was the music at some parts was just so way over kill too loud and too way dramatic the whole story was crap and did not make any logical sense so ur telling us that nasa did not know that the best pilot to fly the space ship was living only about a car drive away from ur secret hiding base? u did build a space ship to fly out but cant have mri machines anymore? a drone was flying for 10 years and no one saw it or knew about it? wtf its like the person who wrote this movie was like thinking we are all so stupid and wont understand who this movie is not making any seance ok the only part i did like about the movie was when they found the bad guy who try to kill the main character that was something interesting and his trying to dock into the space station it was nice story but still none nonsensical bc with time it just dont make any sense so they 2 walk away from the space ship and then when he called the space ship to rescue him u can see they fly so far no way they could of walk that distance then at the same time they rescue the good guy via plane the bad guy can walk all the way back to another plane? while a 3rd one get blown up???wtf and also how many shipped did they send anyways it just did not make any sense to me this movie its just way too stupid sorry but it wasi want my money backnegative,oliver may not be dead  f**k series where the hero dies and to the half of the season  my wife and i will not watch the series if oliver queen not stay alive and return to the series through a maximum of two episodes so  giving time to change the scenario  liven it in any way except for memories of other characters in the series oliver and felicity have to be together and that we have not yet seen in the series atomic  ant  is superman and thats what he needs to become in the series  if he has already put some superpowers  now it turns out that all permanent characters in the series to become a super heroes which makes no sense just because the current craft shops in the series  giving the lowest rating oliver back negative,okay this movie is a comedy right? okay i know that its says here on imdb that it is a drama mystery sci fi but it must be a comedy because the movie is totally laughable the script is totally laughable or worse its a kind of the lawnmower man from 1992 remakewhich was also laughable but you can forgive the lawnmower man for being a bad movie but this one you cant this movie is just like if someone gave a scientist 20 millions dollars so he could invent a technology that could turn cheese back too milk again a total waste of money i sincerely hope that mr depp and mr freeman has donated most off their money that they earned from this to doctors without borders or a children cancer foundation i once saw an interview with mr deep saying that he never goes to any premiere now i know whynegative,okay so i am not one to judge tv shows it is not hard to please me when it comes to watching tv i watch a drastic range from the walking dead to the mentalist to family guy i absolutely adore superheroes and can not say enough about last year movies like the avengers dark night rises and so on so when i wasnt feeling well tonight and decided to stay home i found the perfect opportunity to check out this new show my sister recommended it and i saw the commercials the guy looked hot it looked full of action and seemed like a fun night the last show she recommended to me was revolution and i was not disappointed hmm what she failed to mention is that no one in this show can act the plot is not bad if looked at it overall but each episode is so boring there is no chemistry what so ever i had to force myself to watch eight episodes and i quit i was about to go to sleep when i got angry how the heck is this show doing well? seriously how is that good shows get canceled that actually have great characters plot and directing and this peace of ++++ is actually getting acclaim am i missing something?????negative,okay lets make this simple this is perhaps the worst movie ever made it is more than predictable it so lacks originality that i not only figured out what was going to happen throughout the entire movie less than 10 minutes into it i even could tell you the lines of each character before they spoke them the highly touted fx? they were average at best and considering the budget of this film they could have been infinitely better the acting editing and cinematography were far from cutting edge the best part of this filmthat it ends but not nearly soon enough your best bet skip this movie watch the miniature golf tournament on espn2 insteadnegative,okay guys i gave this movie the lowest  possible for good reason so the movie is a revamp of the guardians franchise some horrible american actor plays a human who was abducted and raised by space pirates that teams together with one of the worst female actors to date  her character is essentially a ninja wicked west of the west let not forget to mention the other 3 main characters a tree a raccoon and a meat head who team up to defeat the strongest entity in the universe + a back and forward treasure hunt the acting is crap the story line is so obvious within minutes of starting even the feeble minded could predict the outcome as for the title guardians of the galaxy i would like to comment that while there is a lot of space flight they only save one planet sort of i am so glad i downloaded a cam version of this movie and didnt waste a cent i would like to say a big eff you to whomever picked the cast to this point marvel has had amazing casts iron man thor  captain america? this movie taints marvel in their pursuit of profit they have created another flop do not bother watching this movienegative,okay from where do i start? first when i heard ben affleck was in it something told me movie would suck & it seems my inner voice was right lol at first movie seems weird no intense moments nothing like that i keep watching in hope something interesting comes but in vain its just so dead empty & jumbled that lacks everything oh by the way there are lots of mistakes im not going to mention all but a few for example she is interviewed at the hospital were she arrived covered in blood telling the story that she was raped and nobody cleans the blood of her in the hospital and she is in a room with lots of cops plus husband lawyer etc etc then she leaves with her husband that was accused of murder and they go home together its just an enormous junk heap of illogical and nonsense movie oh and movie is so stretched its 230 minutes of boring uninteresting & unrealistic plot its as bad as finchers fight club which is another overrated piece of junk just avoid this movie do no waste your time on itnegative,ok so i will start out by saying that i am a huge fan of the books and the series i love it this movie just made me extremely angry i burst out the theater exclaiming they ruined it they ruined it and i ranted on about it for about an hour or so after btw this is my strong personal opinion heres why i hate it so severely 1 it was extremely unfaithful to the book 2 they took out 90% of the books story and replaced it with an awful replacement book by far wins 3 this movie was dark and disturbing a lot of killing and pain and blood and several scenes were otherwise classified as dark my opinion 4 the box does not exist in the book the simulations to open this box do not exist in the book and i hated seeing jeanine torture the divergents 5 tris hates herself and thinks about killing herself i dont think thats a good message shes sending out for a main character to hate herself and think about killing herself may appear that its ok for people out there to feel and do the same and its not 6 the script was poorly written nothing else needed to add 7 the plot was extremely predictable i understand that a ton happens in the book but this way it isnt predictable and i get excited to turn each page in the movie you know what will happen oh this is a simulation even though they pretend it isnt oh they pushed her weak point of course she will do what they want her to do oh she did that yup i knew he would come oh i knew everyone would join yup i knew they would overpower him that sort of junk so there you go i dont want to come off like a hater but i thought it should be known especially with this movie that you should save your money and go buy some ice cream hope i helped a bit and didnt spoil to much =negative,ok ill keep this brief but ill also nail my credentials to the mast first i know science cosmology scifi and filmmaking pretty well i have in the past taught film studies at degree level and worked on the production of more than one major hollywood scifi film i read stephen baxter and i like space stuff a lot more than a lot and why am i telling you this? because i should have loved interstellar but i didnt for one simple reason it is a truly dreadful piece of filmmaking i wont even bother with dissecting the science in the film because that isnt really the issue it is wrong on pretty much every level im not even going to bother complaining about the absurd audio balance in the sound mix and ill ignore the substandard special effects  because fx dont a great movie make the issues i have with interstellar are essentially these the film is an arsenumbing three hours long and feels far longer the pace is stunningly poorly judged  the first hour in particular could have been cut to ten minutes and far more would have been gained than lost the characters are paperthin and i didnt care about any of them the plot is entirely derivative mostly of the vastly superior contact the special effects arent special at all and the editing or lack of is so selfindulgent it is a text book example of a director so enamoured with his project that he loses objectivity the result is a plodding flabby and desperately dull movie devoid of any real excitement or emotional impact i wont go on but special mention must be made of the planets  paddling world and coldworld you see virtually nothing of either and so utterly uninteresting are they that what should have been a moment of genuine cinematic wonderment was squandered with a bit of poor cgi painfully inferior to a perfect storm and a location less dramatic than your own back garden ive probably not been a brief as i intended but as i write this i feel the disappointment and actual anger i felt on leaving the cinema bubbling to the surface again it was a total letdown and a waste of more than three hours of my life the gushing reviews on here are ridiculous and absurd and i am forced to conclude that reviewers either watched a different film to me or saw something so brilliant it completely passed me by i am fairly confident i didnt doze off although i desperately wanted to so in conclusion contact did all of this far far better fifteen years ago in contact the characters are human believable beautifully realised and you care what happens to them the relationship between father and daughter is deeply moving and inspiring but then the plot is far more sophisticated anyway dealing with the social tensions and impact of the discovery of extraterrestrial life the science is accurate and entirely plausible it was written by carl sagan after all the movie is genuinely thrilling and full of spectacle and it has something very profound to say contact is everything interstellar is not and it has a considerably shorter running time contact brought tears to my eyes interstellar bored me to tearsnegative,ok i was fooled by both some of the reviews and the high  and i wasted about 3 hours of my life sitting in the cinema i cant say im a scifi lover but if films like blade runner only get 82 then this one should get 45 i watched gone girl the other day which is so much better than this one both in pacing and plot and that film only get 84how can this one get 9? another thing is the ending is too predictable and too sweet happy ending is good people love things that make them happy but in reality there never has a perfect ending like thatthe ending seems too sweet for me and some people are spoiled by these good endings also dont understand why made the brother a completely fool? he seems has nothing to do with everything? a contrast? to what? and the film never mentioned him after the girl sorry i even dont remember their names find out the secret which doesnt make sense to me anyway im disappointed and i dont want t say more about this film i fell asleep several times due to that horrible pacingi cant believe a film could be sooooo long which almost becomes a torture for menegative,ok i admit im a marvel fan seen almost all the movies and i know some movies are better than others i was quite surprised this movie got a 85 on imdb so it should be good right? my reaction after the last dance was seriously? marvel made this shyt? let me put this simple this movie steals like everything from the original star wars mixes an evil yonda not yoda in it together with pj the raccoon from over the hedge an ent living tree from lord of the rings and a little bit of star trek also the real bad guy gets the hammer of thor only a bigger one but thats a marvel studio idea already it could be a weird but good mixture but it ends up as a deadly cocktail where only the cgi is better than star wars and would actually deserve a better rating than 1 seriously this is a one to watch if you want to see marvels biggest blunder ever marvel isnt marvel if there wont be a sequel but i will skip that one on forehand leaves me to the question how the **** did this movie get a 85?negative,oh my another science fiction film made by those geniuses who never took a science class in life interstellar is a boring slow plodding condescending type of film that thinks is much more smart than it realty is cantt just people go and explore three planets without this melodramatic nonsense? wouldnt it be much better if all this humanist approach was discarded in favor of a story based on the true adventure of traveling through a wormhole? if people want drama there are a huge number of other much better films if i want to feel bad i will watch schindlers list if i want some good science fiction i will watch aliens is it that hard for people to get it? this was supposed to be a science fiction adventure for gods sake why do these genius have to butcher what could have been a great film with all this overbloated sentimentalism this sacchariny mess? this is yet another proof that the masses are brain dead they laud anything that is over complicated with mindless twists with some sort of stupid revelation as the work of a genius interstellar is another extremely over rated film it rivals prometheus in stupidity id rather shoot a nail through my foot than ever watching it againnegative,oh lord where art thou—? well let me start with this i was thinking of many different titles for my little essay most of which were either political incorrect or simply too plain to use but still just a few what happened? or oh my balls or the peak of feminism or the extinction of mankind—etc so the point is that the story we all know well from our childhood got so many twists that you can easily forget it and look into the world of a totally other tale the evil fairy godmother back in the days just an innocent but strong young lady was betrayed by the pretentious young male whos aspiring for the throne of the kingdom of his own country since both of them are orphans no moral issues can interfere with their goals but while maleficent becoming a strong yet caring semigoddess of her realm her counterpart in the humans world still wants the throne but not through some noble deed but as a merit of his servitude evil humans preferably males claim the right for the neighboring country of fairies but fail miserably in their attempt and maleficent fends off the attack with no problem so the king puts a bounty on her head and who else but the onetime lover of the strongest fairies can seduce and bereft her from her wings so mother nature i mean maleficent becomes vengeful waiting for her time to come turning into the evil fairy weve all been waiting for in the meantime for his servitude the little orphan becomes the king of his homeland forgetting about his fairylover and marring a beautiful human being who has all the characteristics of a devoted humble wife she gives life to the young princess aurora and actually her part of the story ends here we never see her again the storyline shows only here some reminiscence of the original tale maleficent bestowing the little child with her curse but from there the story evolves into another path maleficent carefully watching over her cursed goddaughter since the inapt fairies are unable to fulfill their task as babysitters little aurora becoming a young innocent blooming lady caring for nature and her surroundings not knowing of her true origin meets maleficent by chance and the two becoming friends  once maleficent even trying to withdraw her own curse while she is asleep she cannot but prince charming is already on his way giving hope that the one with pure heart can wake her up in the event she should sting herself with the spinningwheels needle which she does— the prince with the help of maleficent gets into the castle and tries to wake aurora with his kiss but fails so comes maleficent kisses her on the cheek begging for forgiveness and my ohmy the young girl awakens from her sleep now that was the point where all those titles came into my mind and as the castle is brittle and princess aurora has already found her home in fairy land the two attempt to escape from her fathers home but ambush lurks around and poor maleficent gets trapped with iron net luckily aurora manages to escape from her own fathers castle ?? and a fierce battle ensues between maleficent and the king although at the end of the battle maleficent cries its over the king still wants to kill her but falls into his death after that maleficent reinstalls the once lovely garden of eden eh i mean fairyland and the two maleficent and aurora lives happily ever after somewhere in the background we can see prince charming i forgot his real name the characters name— but with no special role in the set now aurora as the new queen of fairyland i mean i honestly believe that women should be more involved in the building of our society and equal rights and alike but come on this is an offense against all male viewers not a single time had i the feeling of seeing a positive male character not even the young prince who was more like a puppet for the will of maleficent in this world men are either aggressive or caring only for themselves but does not poses any kind of positive characteristics for which we could support them in such world male are only there to fulfill their task of fertilizing otherwise they have no earthly use females can live happily without males who can only bestow them with sadness and regret i guess this is the kind of attitude which turned this world into a hostile selfish hell not even orwell imagined in his wildest dreams the sheer evilness of the male characters who sometime selfpitying themselves for their own weakness is so onefolded that a paperbag is more versatile than that— all in all the modern adaptation of the story find out the truth as the trailer puts it— is not just disappointing but shows the zeitgeist in such mannerism that one should throw up—sorry— females should be left alone with their fragile souls and naivety and only bothered by men if they humble enough to serve their needs trust me i am not a malechauvinist but after this piece of —film i honestly dont know what to do with my manhood?negative,oh lord where art thouÄ? well let me start with this i was thinking of many different titles for my little essay most of which were either political incorrect or simply too

seriously? i trust your ratings and always check before deciding whether to watch or not i was not furious on my money or my time being wasted like that but did anyone ever thought giving 8+ ratings would put this movie in the league of godfather the shawshank redemption the lord of the ring series goodfellas star wars and likes its utter disrespect and blasphemous for these great movies to put this good for nothing movie and listed and counted among them to praise boyhood as a masterpiece is actually a slap in the face of all those directors who put a real effort into creating works of art that have real value just because you took 12 years filming this doesnt mean you get to get a 99% rt and an 84 imdb without deserving it okay let me see what was this movie about? nothing 12 freaking years of shooting for what? what really happened there? first of all there was no plot no story whatsoever it shows look a boy was 9 playing with his sister fighting with his sister eating macaroni going to bathroom he got taller grew his hair he cut them back grew them again hes eating going to bathroom again drinking kissing a girl breaking up with a girl going to college oh come on thats what kids do they grow up right? the film which is much too long follows an unstable family and focuses on the life of mason a character that has absolutely no interesting characteristics whatsoever hes not a hero not a zero not a lover not a loser not a fighter not even a dreamer theres nothing about this character that will pause you and let you think about it mr linklater couldnt even catch any memorable scene out of it i appreciate his movie shooting technique but there should be more of it since boyhood supposed to be a story about a boys life his inner world his feelings his dream or his struggle growing up his happinesssadness but there is no depth at all for instance i was once a kid now im grown up i saw my life then how my times were my thoughts my actions my dreams etc it could have been like mason as boy how were his thoughts by the time he was growing up what changes he had to face in his adulthood how he struggled or how he enjoyed what was his dream how he adapted with his struggling family instead mr linklater showed some ordinary does not mean they needs to be extraordinary folks leading lives where nothing happened at all this is a not a growing up story this is certainly not a movie about teenage crisis in fact this movie is about nothing so thats the point? call this 12yearsgimmick a masterpiece? oh come on give me a breaknegative,nothing we havent seen you already know is about ai so the first 15 minutes resembling robocop or any other futuristic movie are slow with nothing to add to the plot all along the movie you already know whats going to happen there is no twist at all i can summarize it in one sentence ai goes out of control in the most lineal way visual effects are ok but very repetitive there must be at least 10 shots of people healing themselves after getting shot it reminded me of zombie movies i cant understand why guys like bradd pitt with world war z or johnny depp with this movie are taking part in these kinds of productions what a disappointmentnegative,note if you read my review please vote so that i know if you found my review helpful or not for that matter thanks this movie has johnny depp  this statement alone should suffice but for the sake of humanity i will try to elaborate many years from now if the world is destroyed by nucular holocaust global warning or some such calamity and then an alien ship lands on earth and them aliens get to watch transcendence most probably on bluray with high definition surround sound from the cloud they will regret not reaching the earth earlier they will also have to accept the fact that they could never reach the level of mankind after watching this movie they would laugh if someone told them that marlon brando and lawrence olivier were probably some of the best actors this movie proves that usa movie industry is million miles  no light years  ahead of bollywood movie industry if you just read the end credits you will know that my statement is true never has bollywood been able to have so many americaan names in their credits whereas this movie alone has screens full of bollywood cgi guys if this trend is continued after sometime hollywood will have no technicians to work with and have to give up moviemaking altogether some jealous people have mentioned that this movie is a copy of bicentennial man which is an outright lie transcendence is absolutely fundamentally different from bicentennial man for example the scientist in bicentennial man does not wear glasses also the robot there is not called dr will caster for those others who say that transcendence has borrowed from i robot and twlight zone etc i say only two words cia conspiracy oops i so sound like kevin trudeau i strongly believe that cia used some covert technique such as staring at goats to extract the thoughtwaves of depp as he claimed he has been planning for this movie for the past 10 years and then has given those ideas to bollywood movie makers to diminish american read hollywood achievement even when hollywood makes a movie entitled dances with wolves there is no wolves dancing in the movie and that alone shows how far ahead the tamil film industry in comparison to hollywood is some reviewers have stated that this movie would win all the oscar awards one has also mentioned cannes since movies such as terminator godzilla i robot transformers and others  all of which are made based on concepts stolen from parts of endhiran by a method i mentioned earlier hint cia was involved  have won so many oscar and cannes awards transcendence is bound to surpass them all by winning in all categories at the oscars and cannes negative points the only negative point of this movie is its short length this movie should have been at least 6 hours long for detailed character development and other aspects if simple movies such as once upon a time in america which neither had songs nor cgi could be 4 hours long transcendence the greatest movie ever made surely should have been at least 6 hours long on second thought i also think that the number of songs is too less for such an epic movie with the honorable mr depp sorry if the spellings are wrong note if any of you would like to say something personally to me you may please write to me at pinchashodi at yahoo com thanksnegative,not worth a visit to the theater totally clumsy and amateurish ignorant of the most basic cinematography completely out of pace absolutely no sense of time rendering the plot is so unstructured that its just a mess eg we are introduced to the prince then he disappears then he reappears and thats it so lifeless that editing seems like the land of lost opportunities there no actual interplay between scenes they just follow one another in mere succession no character development for example you get no sensible feel of who the three fairies are and why they behave like they do a repetitiveness of emotions the scenes with maleficent and the beauty are the same and the same and the same no escalation nowhere throughout youd expect the scene where maleficent becomes who she is to be a tower of power but no they could not even get a single scene right the final battle is so out of rhythm that its just a bore instead of having your beat rising the storyline is just a plain line to sum up it feels like a high school production of a play written by children in all this mess angelina could be nothing but flat as if steppedover by an elephant just a long puzzled snore shame cause it really could be an awesome movie but thats what you get when you hire a guy robert stromberg who has never directed before  for your 200000000 movie and they say hollywood is conservative and unadventurous i m pretty sure that the 75 is not untouched after all it cost 200000000 and they have to make sure they get their money back i m also sure that after it runs its course the real rating will be revealed to be much worsenegative,not that funny at all it was a total embarrassment this was one of those movies in which i wish i could have put a bag over my head while walking out the theater because i was too embarrassed for people to see that i had gone to this movie the good ol f word seems to make up most of the script the movie was filled with stupid scenes very little of anything original came out of this film i thought the scene with freebird blasting would never end this was just plain embarrassing tell the writers and producers to please make some better movies than this im really trying to forget i went to this movie so this gets two thumbs downnegative,not sure how this movie has such good reviews it is one of the most boring and dumb movies i have ever seen in my entire life this is 2 12 hours of my life i will never get back do yourself a favor and dont waste your time on this garbage i honestly gave it a shot i watched the thing the whole way though about 14 of the way through the movie i really wanted to turn it off it just didnt keep my interest the ending makes it even worse and just puts the icing on the cake for a terrible freaking movie i am glad i didnt go to see this in the movies because i would have demanded to get my money back i am usually pretty open minded when it comes to movies there have been a few ive seen that are like wow that was terrible this is definitely one of those in my opinionnegative,not only did everything happen way too fast it didnt make much sense either as it was told to us near the end he was the more or less same person as before death doing everything not because of his own desire but because of the women he lovesd what she wanted was explained and he did exactly that being able to heal the planet being able to cure diseases and injuries enhance and watch over literally everything just why in the name of pickles did he decided to throw everything away? his processing capabilities were supposed to be beyond comprehension and the best thing he could come up with was basically sending the world back to the stone age? and people were actually lining up behind this idea? lets see no communication no worth of money no medication no order no disaster recovery its the end of economy so what comes are spreading sicknesses starvation maybe a few wars here and there just to spice it up a little its pure chaos and anarchy nothing more so against the wishes heal the planet to help people of the most important person to him against his owndesire to keep her alive he was like ah screw it that the blondie wouldve shot the other guy my apologies im not good with names is yet again irrelevant with the power at his fingertips he wouldve been able to recover him as well but killing off his love himself and probably billions more is sure a better idea and please dont try the people fear what they dont know or they were scared it would take over the world bull**** because with just an ounce of intelligence theyd have realized that the upcoming suffering and deaths of this new dark age and more suffering and deaths in this still imperfect world is no better option than the worst case scenario the hive mind and loss of individuality order prosperity and evolution again that was the worst case scenario which was not at all the case personally i find it difficult to understand his everything but logical decisions to put it lightly for me this movie was simply horrible an awful experience ps i do not exactly care about the actors the acting the serenity the animations or anything elseat all i am talking about the story the plot nothing elsenegative,no spoiler needs to be flagged here it was spoiled from the start 165 minutes of nothing a waste of film and 13 years i havent watched a movie boring in years at best patricia arquette was almost ray light however the movie was so bad i even got tired of seeing her if i had rented this movie at redbox for $1 it wouldnt have been worth it cartoons have more depth im not sure how this movie is up for any award unless maybe a golden raspberry since it took 13 years you could give the golden raspberry for lifetime achievementnegative,no need for a spoiler here the ending is so bizarre unbelievable and pretentious it is the type of ending a hollywood director on lsd might make that being said nolan does make the 5th dimension a realitystupidity i cant believe the yawning of 10s and 9s i guess you cannot trust the critics or the movie audience anymore if you believe that movies should be believable coherent and enjoyable then you fail the test to see this move period so my advice to you is simple read the book first oh wait there is no book? that is because there isnt a publishing company that would print it let me give you a line from the movie and you tell me if it is worth seeing who are they? i dunno but they are real and wanted us to be here that is because we are they oooookaaaynegative,never posted on imdb before and i never thought i would but this time i had to i am a movie buff watched thousands of films and i love it i was looking forward to this movie great reviews and 84 on imdb i never read reviews listen to my friends or ever watch trailers because i like going in with a clean slate thats when ive had my best film experiences try it this movie is garbage i love finchers work but he failed miserably at this one so the movie starts out as an interesting dramathriller with the usual effects then it turns over to black comedysatire with the same direction?? i couldnt believe the last third ive never seen this many plot holes in any movie unbelievable garbagenegative,my goodness where do we start? first of all the many 10s this got must have come from the cast and crew or a bunch of people with the scientific knowledge of a 3yrold nolan must know nothing about real science he bandies wormholes and anomolies around like he really knows what they are had there not been so many high paid actors in this it probably would have never been filmed at all just shows that putting big hollywood stars in a movie doesnt guarantee a good product in the end i wont go into all the flaws and idiotic ideas mentioned but just imagine a movie with less scientific expertise than the old 60s show lost in space will robinson and his robot were more believable than anything shown in this laughable attempt at a science fiction movie the biggest irony is that the whole point of the movie was to save humanity as soon as possible by finding a new planet to live on yet they didnt even get back the first time for 23 years and when they return nothing has changed on earth at all his kids are grown but they still live in the same run down house and michael caine who was about 80 when they left seems not to have aged at all when they get back and the crops that were supposed to be dying off causing the death of humanity all look exactly the same still acres and acres of corn fields waiting to be harvested every time they tried to say something intelligent the audience laughed no one in the theater took this movie seriously at all sad because they might have done so much with this idea had they incorporated people who understood space travel and general science bottom line this was a low budget script with a load of expensive actors what a wastenegative,most overrated show ive seen ever i know that a lot of tv is awful but gets swallowed up because people do not venture far from the mainstream dumbed down hypnotic crap which constantly flows through the screen like a sewage pipe however i did not know that the amount of people who are this uncultured and blind to any critical thought was this huge imdb used to be still is in many cases its a good site either way a reliable source for figuring out whether a showfilm was worth looking into put seeing the high ratings of arrow which is 82 at the time of this being written and the latest hunger games movie ive lost hope the spoiler free premise rich brat kid goes on a boat trip with his dad hes got a coke problem and lacks moral and discipline boat sinks everyone dies except him he manages to maroon himself on an island during this time he somehow manages to survive without any food nor drinking water and probably with some bad coke withdrawal symptoms he makes a bow out of what he can find on the island gets really good at hunting animals and survives long enough for another ship to find him well this doesnt seem too bad leaving out some of the backstory and other revelations of course but for some reason he is now a parkour master with martial arts skills hacking skills did he practice on a homemade computer he built out of wood and bear skin or something maybe he powered it by putting a propeller in a tube and farting really hard to make a windturbine? now what he should have done on that island is trained on his damn acting because it blows if i was an actor in la trying to make a name for myself i would of bought the boxset and hit myself in the head repeatedly until i died from head trauma but if that isnt horrible enough the entire cast share the most stale unnatural awful awful acting abilities as the lead it wouldnt have surprised me if the director got blown by every single member of the cast to be on this god forsaken show its just so sad to see resources which could have fed starving children go to waste on this melodrama of an actionshow too bad dramas require acting which the cast does not suffice to provide it should be called bags of skin who might actually be robots reciting the terrible writing of a talentless person on camera held by another talentless person who somehow managed to get payed and recognized in a extremely tough business instead of acting in this case the style of this series is extremely similar to smalville with a lot of bright light and water drops in the eyes of the pretty female actresses to make them look better which is the one thing they actually can do for the most part with the oily 80s pornflick filter and the halfarsed special effects though smallville actually being a half decent show gets a pass there was one scene i laughed out loud at it wasnt actually the scenes where the directorwriter intended it to be funny because those scenes were so tryhard funny that i literally cringed it was a scene where mr arrow shoots an arrow next to this generic bad guys head the bad guy says hah you missed whereas mr arrow replies i didnt lol apparently he shot the the arrow which actually had a flashdrive instead of a tip into the usb slot behind the bad guy which also contained a virus which mr arrow had taught himself to program on the island or something? which brought down the evil database epic haha great writing indeed no clichs included i actually dislike this series so much i feel good writing how awful it is maybe i can discourage a single person to watch this lobotomy of a show and that would be enough to make me feel glad tldr horrendous acting clichridden awful holeridden unoriginal and uninspiring writing horrendous acting overrated by people who would drink the koolaid as long as the trailer had explosions in it directing and special effects on high school film project standards thats actually insulting to high schoolers since they actually have creativity sorry acting horrendous

the good guys and who are the bad guys and im not stupid i think the creators of this film went a little bit too far in trying to surprise the viewer all they achieved is a lot of confusion if youre interested in watching a surprising and understandable movie go watch the gamenegative,mindless entertainment usually has some charm to it if nothing else guardians delivers none of that throughout the whole film it provided maybe two sincerely funny moments while the rest of it came across mostly as unintentional comedy thanks to a gibberish script ive never laughed at someone dying of cancer before but the prologue of guardians is just so hilariously godawful it had me in stitches all through the opening credits oh christ what a forgettable uninteresting and pitifully bland mess of a film this was i suppose it appeals to easily impressionable simpletons but i struggle to see how theres hardly any character development the plot is nonsense from start to finish the antagonist is some bland and boring caricature who seemingly only exists as a vehicle to introduce thanos who is a big deal im assuming? and its all just so damn predictable perhaps worst of all the ending is just another anticlimactic retread of the old and tired power of love trope i may have given guardians at least one point if it had decent effects and camera work put into it but none of that is to be found herenegative,mementothe dark knight trilogy the prestige inception and moneyball there all pretty decent films wouldnt you say? one thing that all those films had in common is the fact they were all overseen in a dop sense by renowned cinematography wally pfister dont even try say that last name correctly christopher nolans go to cinematographer until his recent upcoming interstellar working with nolan on his modern day classics wouldve taught you a thing or two about the thinking mans blockbuster wouldnt you say? well sadly with transcendence it looks like wally didnt listen in class looking to debut his directing career with a scifi not dissimilar to the large thinking themes of inception pfister has gone for the knockout straight away and left himself completely exposed to the blows that a weak storyline shoddy editing and mismanaged performances will deal out transcendence looks to delve deep into the modern day tech filled world that is increasingly blurring the lines between what it is to be human and human emotion being overtaken by artificial intelligence its a high end concept and a concept no doubt ripe for exploration yet pfister doesnt lay hold on any firm grip of his subject that gets lost in an uninteresting love story badly played jumps in time and a finale that not only feels rushed but feels horribly underdeveloped much like the movies performances stealing previous nolan acting collaborators in the forms of rebecca hall still crying out for a decent role cillian murphy morgan freeman and lucas haas its clear that pfister was able to draw some serious talent to his tale mix these actors in with johhny depp paul bettany and kate mara and the recipe was all there to provide one of this years most unique and intriguing ensembles the cast however here is universally terrible working with material that is clearly underdeveloped the increasingly acting for hire type role by johnny depp comes off worse as will caster but there is no one staking a claim here for acting honours in what is a showcase for pfisters inability to draw out commanding performances something his teacher nolan has always been able to achieve transcendence has a few neat visual tricks up its sleeve which is to be expected for a man whos given us some of recent cinemas most iconic imagery but even these flourishes cannot paint over the fact that the film is a complete mishmash of half cooked ideas uninteresting dramatics and weak acting efforts somewhere deep inside this tale something is waiting to burst to life but this is one startlingly bad debut by a cinematographer that should be on the phone to some of his old mates begging for his job back as his latest career move looks to have stalled before it really even began half an abnormal raindrop out

attractive its dusty but the dust doesnt settle on the corn no dust cloud follows the pickup as they plough through the cornfield chasing a drone this is a totally unexplained encounter the family are so busy watching the drone that they nearly drive over a cliff even though they are on their own land perhaps because they are driving the pickup blind yet fast enough to keep up with a jetpowered drone hello??? no intelligible explanation for how mm landed the drone what he found in it how a groovy pile of dust helped him find the space station nor why they hired him to fly the mission why should michael caine be the nasa project director  he is hardly an obvious rocket scientist why such a bizarre robot? and did it wake them all up before the worm hole  or did i miss how that was to happen in the mumbles lo and behold  despite having travelled for months to the wormhole end near saturn they find themselves right beside a suitable planet at the other end but i guess that was the work of them it is key to the plot but there is no scientific concept that would make 1 hour on a planet into 7 years and how come the open sea is paddleable and a vast tsunami appears? despite the size of the waves all is immediately calm and they seem to be predictable stuck some equally improbable idea was going to solve this problem but id lost interest it is the moment i walked out the movie to that point was uninteresting and wholly illogical i really thought with all the hype it would be compelling instead it was plain irritating anne hathaway was okay at least we could hear what she was saying and we could hear everyone else for that matter poor miscast good ol boy matthew i have now read the wikipedia synopsis which is likewise unintelligible and am hugely glad that i left  even though i have wasted one hour of the two hours i saved by writing this reviewnegative,man oh man this movie was terrible how this got an 86 is beyond me and in fact thats what i went based off of and luckily never really go to movies now days because of all the crappy movies hollywood pumps out there is nothing to this movie i went with a friend and i literally kept falling asleep every now and then looking at my watch hoping it will be over its just an empty movie all action with no story nothing just some shooting here and there and stupid jokes all recent movies like this including the new amazing spiderman 2 are just terrible movies with nothing to them hollywood is just a cash cow now and this is why i refuse to pay for movies in theatresnegative,maleficent was marvelously shot with beautiful effects and a dark and dreary setting that let you escape from your normal everyday world it even had some good performances but besides that dont even waste a dollar at redbox to see this piece of crap what in the world got into their head that made them warn to change the original character? in order to change that character they had to reroute the entire storyline and transform beloved strong willed characters into weak and stupid characters or good willed characters into evil one dimensions ions psychopaths and make a very important character pretty much pointless to the story okay from here on there are spoilers if you have not seen the movie do not read on maleficent was changed into a weak and clichd piece of crap character to try in promote strong female roles in other films but she was only taken to a deeper level of weakness in the original she was strong and evil and she didnt have to have a back story because her story wasnt the main story she even turned into a stinking dragon in this version she was symbolically raped then she went all stereotypical and clich strong girl on us and decided to get revenge on her ex lover only this time she just cursed his daughter come on i mean thats not even exact revenge thats just stupidity if i were her idve killed the sucker immediately and just not worry about the daughter and then she tries to help the girl age cursed by attempting to break it how does being an antagonist with a heart of gold translate with audiences? uh not very well on top of that they changed her into a hero halfway through for no good reason at all except to make disney happy so its not like ultra dark unfortunately while doing this they ruined the dragon not only was maleficent not the one that transformed into the dragon it only took the soldiers like a total of 30 seconds to bring it down i mean seriously i counted then to top off this review i cant forget prince phillip the strong hearted prince who comes to save his true love for the evil sorceress only in this version hes a random guy who says hello to aurora once then gets this absurd infatuation with her and gets it into his head that he wants to kiss her then theres stephan and the fairies which if youve seen the movie dont even need an explanationnegative,maleficent was marvelously shot with beautiful effects and a dark and dreary setting

youve seen the movie dont even need an explanationnegative,maleficent is the very first movie in my long list of movies that i have seen that i wanted to walk out of lets start with the positives angelina jolie was incredible she was beautiful she was strong and she executed maleficent beautifully her relationship with aurora was refreshing and nice the magical world was something that has been seen on movies like bridge to terabithia but it was still beautiful and engaging but all of this does not save the movie i expected to walk in and see a movie similar to wicked where we get a better understanding of the bad guy yes us understanding the bad guy does not excuse what they have done but we can see where they come from in the musical wicked and even in the movie great and powerful oz we have sympathy for the character we previously viewed as the bad guy we could see where she was coming from in those adaptations nobody truly ended up becoming the bad guy most were victims of circumstances in maleficent? it was ferngullyavatar all over again magical people good man baaaaaad instead of giving depth to all the characters that previously were left rather flat and on the background on the original sleeping beauty suddenly the king has been reduced to this one dimensional villain that created the evil maleficent and later on becomes obsessed with killing her he was given no aspects that would make us have even the tiniest bit of sympathy not the smallest bit of understanding he was just a vile man that broke maleficents heart mutilated her and cared only for power even when he tried to protect his daughter it was made appear more like he was protecting his property rather than a person he loved yes he graveled for her for a bit begging maleficent not to curse her but that was it the movie left all traces of the good of the humanity from it ok it had some of the good of humanity but the only human that was portrayed as good was aurora the movie tried to portray the three fairies as the comic relief but ended up just portraying them as idiots incompetent selfish creatures the fairies in the original disney movie were clumsy and unused to taking care of a child but they were like that because for the first time in their lives they could not rely on their magic to achieve things in life if were as modern people were thrown in to the middle of the woods and had to do everything by hand then yes we would be as lost as they were but they were given 16 years to evolve to learn and to grow but no the fairies were not given even the smallest of story arc in this movie they were creatures that switched sides when ever it benefited the movie i mentioned before that i liked the relationship that maleficent and aurora had in the movie but even that was shattered later on in the movie the solution to the problem was not a surprise at all it was taken straight out of frozen it was refreshing and incredible when frozen did it because it was the first time disney did not use the age old solution of a man being the one delivering the kiss of true love but when the same solution the same realization is done in a movie that came out within year of each other? it is boring and in no way exiting it is in no way entertaining we have learned nothing new is this disneys new approach in relationship? love between man and a woman is obsolete but the love between girl family kind of love not lesbian kids apparently cant handle that and also family excludes male family members at this moment as well only women can feel true loveis the strongest of all the loves in this world in the end the movie basically told the audience yeah the moviestory that has been told for decades is actually a propaganda and i should know because i am queen aurora and i was there all along the original sleeping beauty was rather black and white good vs evil when i walked in to the theatre i expected the lines to be blurred to be thought all stories have two sides not all of our actions are blatantly good or evil but instead the writers and directors and what nots decided to make the line between good and evil even more visible the good creatures are good no matter what they do and the bad humans are bad and rotten all the way in conclusion the movie might have given some depth to a villain that previously had been left as a rather one dimensional character but in exchange they created a new one dimensional villain just switching the genders around the worlds was beautiful and the lead actress was amazing but even she could not save this rehash of a movie in the endnegative,maleficent attempts to tell an old story anew but all it does is completely redefine the title characters personality without taking the time to create a feasible explanation and alternative to the well known fairytale in disneys new maleficent we first see maleficent as a young girl with magnificent wings she is the largest fairy and protector of the magical moors from the greedy humans in another nearby kingdom she meets a human stefan who befriends her and she eventually falls in love with him only to be betrayed by his selfish and sinful humannature this is the new and unknown backstory that motivates the maleficent we know from the animated disney narrative children will enjoy this movie it is beautifully designed and full of wonderful scenery with magical creatures and talking trees disney plays into the innocence of children and fascination they have for nature and capitalize on it there is the darkness of a discernible villain and the light of a righteous hero adults and fans of the fairy tale will be disappointed the film is drawn out because no story progresses nor evolution occurs within maleficent the plot is flimsy weak and completely inconsistent with the narrative and poorly conceptualized nothing makes any sense and the title characters behavior is neither explained with a backstory nor revealed as a sad misunderstanding the writers try to make you believe that maleficent endured the ultimate betrayal and by her closest most trusted loved one there is absolutely no proof of this with the exception of a fabulously believable freak out by angelina jolie when she awakens to find herself mutilated no wonderful love story involving the future king stefan is shown and the first five minutes should only exist on the editing room floor there is a nice sentiment behind the makers intentions but the entire story is unrefined like a first draft director robert stromberg is new and it shows he lacks the confidence ability and experience to take the initiative and lead the story the writer linda woolverton is most at fault in her creation of a feeble unconvincing and baseless story executives should have used some of their $180million dollar budget on consulting with gregory maguire then there would be an intelligent logical but beautiful plot and woolverton could do what she does best create a screenplay to match now for the worst party of the film the fairy god mothers oh dear lord what have they done to the fairy godmothers? they are flighty imbecilic selfabsorbed twits since the story is so moronic the fairy involvement in raising aurora is explained with an impractical sentence as is most of the film then they spend the whole 16 years they are supposedly watching aurora by complaining about its inconvenience and arguing like the three stooges elle fanning is not the enchanting aurora and her aurora is annoyingly cloying they try to make it seem like this profound love exists for aurora from maleficent angelina jolie looks like maleficent she has the stature the prowess the harsh beauty and the outfit but little else sadly she never really acts and her accent is slacking she just stands and glares i never sense malice anger love betrayal or anything for that matter and certainly not ominous villainous evil i am supposed to believe she has a quiet strength from her power? no im guessing stromberg was taken by her beauty and celebrity and thought that sufficient with a flimsy story bad acting and a complete disregard for the storys structure the whole thing is preposterous is creating a harmonious rational account where a fairy turns evil really that difficult? or did executives hope that nobody would notice behind the cloak of the disneyjolie name

seen gigli and birdemic the concept of the film far exceeded its actual execution it was just a tortuous experience for me i sat there forcing myself to finish it forcing myself to forgive its shortcomings praying for something profound to hit me i think the film really shows linklaters failure to connect with the generation he attempts to portray hell use a pop song or a shot of an ipod or some other cheap reference to suggest a specific moment in time but his perspective is that of an ignorant adult oversimplifying or completely misinterpreting the internal experience of childhood maybe thats why so many critics identify with the film because they like many adults suffer from the same disillusionment when failing to understand young people today and why are there so many onedimensional characters in this film? this is inexcusable the lead actor the sister the mother the two alcoholic step fathers the girlfriends the most interesting character is by far the dad played by ethan hawke who is actually a complex human being like the rest of us who grows always trying to guide his son and impart wisdom where he can even when unqualified everyone else is a shadow of a borderline offensive clich why arent more critics mentioning this? the lead was clearly cast because he was a goodlooking kid there obviously isnt a single acting bone in his body he doesnt even seem interested in anything there is a dull lifelessness in his performance i cant help but think linklater views teenagers as dull lifeless emotionless creatures i give the filmmakers credit for experimenting with their creativity and committing to the process but is this really the best picture frontrunner? really??? with this script? these performances? seriously?negative,make fun of me

the other 2 hrs was really disappointing while the timeline of actors and culture serves to make this movie somewhat unique there wasnt much of a plot other than this is what its like in real life in which case it would be a documentary but it was not there was a good introduction in the 1st houri was still waiting to anticipate how the plot would go but not much buildup no climax and no resolution pretty disappointing to what i thought might be a good storynegative,listen im not a smart man but i have basic reasoning skills and common sense now whilst i understand that scifiction doesnt follow the rules of reality suspension of disbelief and all there still has to be coherency rules and order however fantastical within the made up world so that people buy into the movie this movie lacks those attributes in spades and is a bitch slap to the viewers intelligence in one snippet of the three hour nonsense youll endure and i do mean endure the intrepid saviors of the world decide to check out a water planet because their predecessor sent a beacon that this was a viable planet for new earth but within minutes of their landing on two inches of water they realize that a giant wave had smashed their scout to bits promptly after she landed years before and they were about to suffer the same fate but oh happy day they manage to escape wasting only a few hours of their time but decades of earth time well that sucks but it makes sense that they had to check it out right? not when you realize they could have avoided the watery planet from hell if the first scout hadnt sent out a beacon saying the planet was viable in the first place after all how could she know that in the mere minutes between when she landed and was then smashed to bits?? nice to know that when the fate of mankind is in the balance a responsible scientist would jump to such a rushed conclusion hey guys i just landed here looks great come now xoxo then you have another scientist on another planet who was supposedly selflessly brave enough to go on a oneway trip to scout a planet then chicken shis out when he gets there and realizes its not viable and hes a dead man so selfishly dooms mankinds one chance by having them waste their limited resources to get there just to unwittingly rescue him but then decides he can still save mankind by killing his rescuers so that he can complete the mission all by himself holy whiplash with his conflicting moralitiesimmoralities batman i could go on and on but i wont i conclude by saying it really irks me when a movie like this gets lauded as a masterpiece when its really just acid tripping rubbishnegative,like many others i was shocked by how bad this movie was and the many plot holes its hard to know where to startamy being sent home from the hospital still covered in blood was one low point i also agree with the earlier reviewer who says the movie is antifemale empowerment it makes the commentators on tv talking about domestic violence seem like the enemybecause you know at that point the husband is wrongly accused so you see the women talking about husbands murdering wives on the pseudonancy grace talk show as false accusers and man haters very disturbing however i wrote this review to point out one plot hole one very big plot hole nobody else seemed to notice again spoiler here amy is a psychopath supposedly the whole story turns on the idea that she is sociopathic and abusive and has been for years witness her framing of the exboyfriend 8 years earlier why then does she givelend her parents almost her entire trust fund simply because they ask? it is already established that they care more for fictional amazing amy than for her her reason at the end of the day the trust fund is really their money huh? thats how a psychopath sociopath thinks about parents she doesnt like? or was it part of her evil plan all along to end up broke in missouri so she could start to hate her husband and try to frame him? sarcasm its just dumb how did this movie and book get such great buzz? i left the movie wondering sadly is this what people like now? btw i watched this with a largely college age audience who laughed several times especially when amy flips her nonbloodsoaked blond hair at the end of the bloody murder scene at then laughed again when the credits were rollingnegative,like many others i was disappointed with the fact that for the big screen almost all the elements which made the tv series mission impossible so entertaining  the team ethos the complex contricks etc  were jettisoned in favour of a huge ego boost for the one man show that is mr tom cruise it is particularly annoying given that the plot chosen to replace it is so bogstandard and predictable an honest hero is framed for something he didnt do and spends the rest of the movie trying to clear his name and out the real spy this seems to be the plot of every third blockbuster these days  two titles released just before mi using exactly the same storyline spring to mind judge dredd and schwarzeneggers eraser it was also totally unnecessary to take the hero of the original series and make him the villain of the movie  can you imagine a film version of the untouchables with the cops hot on the trail of the evil gang boss eliot ness? there is also the fact that the movie is deeply insecure one feels that it would like to be a coldwar style espionage picture but does not have the courage of its convictions so tacks a cheesy and implausible action sequence onto the end i could go on but at the end of the day my list of criticisms are all are all pretty subjective and dont really point to this being a bad film simply one that i dont like but then suddenly it struck me the reason i find this movie so intensely pointless and the reason i think its no good is that so many scenes are so stupid or just completely extraneous take for example the films most memorable moment  the break in to the cia building to steal half of the noc list we are told that this is the most secure room in the entire world that it has every security system known to man except it seems a plain and simple good old cctv camera sure the scene is well directed and a fair amount of tension is wrung from it but if you take a step back to think its preposterous besides by my reckoning there is no reason for hunt even to have the real noc list if he is planning on double bluffing simply to smoke out the spy so the scene shouldnt even be there why would he endanger all those agents by handing over the real list? nit picking? certainly but it sums up for me why the whole thing is a waste of time there are plenty of movies one can enjoy by checking ones brain in at the theatre door but when a movie cloaks itself in a supposedly complex plot and encourages the audience member to engage his or her brain and then doesnt even stand up to scrutiny i find the whole process deeply depressing  more so when the film takes itself as seriously as this one evidently does i cant even be entertained anymore because i am acutely aware of how shallow empty and ultimately pretentious it all is so sorry folks but if you ask me this is a red herring wrapped up in a macguffin wrapped up in a shaggy dog story with fleas all designed for the sole purpose of making tommy look good its a real shame that the supporting cast production values direction etc are all so high since the film itself is so thoroughly worthless at my most generous id give it 410negative,like many other reviewers im giving this a 1 in a feeble attempt to balance out all the unwarranted 10s i keep seeing even though i really think it deserves a 5 or maybe a 6 i actually created an account just to do this so i figured i might as well include a review along with my rating many will say try to tell you that you shouldnt attempt to compare this movie to 2001 that they are two totally different movies etc this is ridiculous they are quite similar on multiple levels with interstellar obviously taking many cues and inspirations from kubricks masterpiece i feel that if we compare the two we can get a good idea of where nolans film went wrong the main reason 2001 has remained so powerful and held up so well is that it doesnt try to explain and rationalize everything that happens we see the events of the movie unfold but as the movie nears its psychedelic conclusion we are really left to our own guesswork as to what is going on has he entered another dimension? an alternate universe? an alien spacecraft? is he just dead? the mere fact that we have no idea whether this scene depicts something spiritual something scientifically quantifiable or a mix of the two makes it so much more moving than if kubrick had tried to explain it through the available science of his time interstellar answers far too many questions which as is often the case ends up raising infinitely more nolan makes it clear from the get go that this film is supposed to function on more of an emotional level than a scientific one then why even bother have the film fact checked by a astrophysicist? why create this confusing mixture of real and pseudo science in the first place? to me in a lot of scenes this kind of shatters the air of mysticism nolan seemed to be going for the floating bookcase in a black hole sequence for instance seemed really magical until cooper suddenly has a bunch of epiphanies and becomes positive that the structure was created by future humans not aliens that they created it specifically for him so he could navigate 5d and communicate with his daughter and that he can save the world only by manipulating a watch with gravity boom there goes all the mystery and lets assume his theory is correct and this structure was indeed constructed by mankind from the future hmmm guess it turns out that we didnt perish from constant dust storms after allãinstead we survived hundreds of thousands of years into the future and went on to create mindblowing interdimensional space technology then what exactly is future us so worried about? they seem to be doing just fine without any alteration of the past this is just the tip of the iceberg as far as far as all of the inconsistencies and unanswered questions youll find in this movie if you have a very analytical mind steer clear of itãi am not a mathy or sciencey person by any stretch yet even i struggled at times to put my logic in the backseat and just enjoy the ride thats what id advise you to do if you want to have a good time watching this movie dont overthink it if you can just do that youll find an entertaining film with truly stunning visual effects a great if maybe a little too over the top  from hz and very convincing performances from the actors i found some scenes very moving i liked the concept of a future that as a result of a technological lull doesnt look very different from our present there are a lot of positive things to say about this film and yet the end result is sadly maybe just a couple pegs above mediocrenegative,like its protagonist kenneth branaghs liveaction adaptation of the disney animated classic cinderella proves to be little more than a dull vapid mess covered up by a sparkly blue dress and no amount of computergenerated mice slapstick pumpkins or good old fashioned bonham carter charm can save it once again director branagh shows that the only thing he does better than shakespeare is soulless cgi spectacle everyone is familiar with the cinderella story and being that this particular iteration makes no effort to diverge from the triedtrue fairy tale anyway this critic shall not waste any time in summarizing it to be brief heroine ella  cinderella being a derogatory nickname cooked up by her

stepmother but by her blood mother as well ella puts blind loyalty to authority figures over her own happiness and wellbeing thus becoming a perfect rolemodel to young women speaking of wicked stepmothers cate blanchett as the evil lady tremaine lends a subtlety and nuance to the role that might be compared to that of a bull in a china shop of course how else can the audience tell that the stepmother is bad if she doesnt follow every act of overthetop wanton cruelty with a smirk and a malevolent chuckle? the films saving grace comes unsurprisingly in the form of helena bonham carter whose light and incredibly fun portrayal of ellas fairy godmother makes for a very watchable ten minutes in the middle of the film carter fills the screen with her presence and certainly woke this critic out of his nearcatatonic state of boredom even making weitzs trite wooden dialogue feel clever of course when it comes down to it this is a spectacle movie and on that end it lives up the use of cgi animals is obvious and often unnecessary  im sure that they still make real deer mr branagh  and the magic of the movie is unfortunately limited to the fairy godmothers standout scenes in the middle but the effects are nevertheless detailed and fun to watch the film is an absolute parade of lovely costumes designed by sandy powell especially the endless supply of bizarre yet beautiful outfits worn by blanchett patrick doyles  is grandiose and seems to be struggling to carry the emotional weight of the film as the actors clearly are not making any effort to do so in all this is a largely forgettable flick that trudges on through an uninspired and clichd retelling of a story that has been told far too many times already without any fresh offerings or inspiring rolemodels even children are sure to be unimpressed by this obviously mechanical piece of cold corporate cashinnegative,like its protagonist kenneth branaghs liveaction adaptation of the disney animated classic cinderella proves to be little more than a dull vapid mess covered up by a sparkly blue dress and no amount of computergenerated mice slapstick pumpkins or good old fashioned bonham carter charm can save it once again director branagh shows that the only thing he does better than shakespeare is soulless cgi spectacle everyone is familiar with the cinderella story and being that this particular iteration makes no effort to diverge from the triedtrue fairy tale anyway this critic shall not waste any time in summarizing it to be brief heroine ella _ cinderella being a derogatory nickname cooked up by her endlessly irritating stepsisters _ is left in the care of her heinous stepmother after both of her parents contract a horrible case of plot device and die there is a prince a fairy

inspiring rolemodels even children are sure to be unimpressed by this obviously mechanical piece of cold corporate cashinnegative,let me start by saying that maleficent has been a personal favorite of mine when it comes to disney villains throughout her many interpretations she has simply been evil yes with a capital e so forgive me if this review is a bit of a rant in this adaptation she is reinterpreted as a good fairy because shes apparently not a human sorceress anymore? that simply has a hissyfit she is certainly not evil  just angry for a little while she even ends up becoming a godmother?? even king stephens character is butchered why does he go insane over her? if he were really the bad guy why wouldnt he have killed maleficent when he had the chance? what possible reason does he have for being indifferent about the welfare of his daughter? speaking of aurora its worth mentioning that she is relatively alright but still not too close to her original character a petty aesthetic thing about her is that her hair and eyebrows are not the same color which is really distracting additionally they rehash the concept from frozen which is that true love doesnt have to be from some man if this trend continues from disney all well see is sisterlygodmotherlyfamily love movies where romance is thrown out the window because it apparently doesnt end with a happily ever after anymore overall this film was simply horrible if you respected maleficent as a villain if you did like maleficent as she was i dont recommend seeing this movie even if you like the idea of there being no such thing as evil i urge you not to see this movie dont support the people who made itnegative,let me start by saying that i have enjoyed christopher nolans work in the past memento insomnia parts of the batman trilogy i find him a very talented filmmaker with strong ideas and visual sense therefore it makes me very sad to state that categorically this is an absolute turkey in many places the plot is so full of holes that you can do little but laughout loud there will be reviewers on here talking about depth intimations of mortality etc etc forget it this is just a total misfire actors used to say despairingly that they were playing johnny exposition  you know the guy who explains everything to the audience note i said despairingly this has almost every character explaining everything from wormholes to the mystery of love oh yeah after a totally boring drawnout beginning which seems to be there to prove that nolan has watched the grapes of wrath many times over we get the first huge laugh when we meet sir michael caine with a laughable posh  cockney  american accent he is playing the part that sam shephard in this or morgan freeman usually play he is not up to it never was never will be it takes a certain amount of skill to be able to deliver line after line of pseudoscientific gobbledygook and make it sound real caines performance  like so many of his performances  screams out wheres my bleedin paycheck? when coop gary cooper  westerns  get it agrees to fly this practically suicidal mission to the outer reaches of space he blasts off like a cosmic cowboy all bravado and charisma  at which point his fellow crew member shows him  with a pen and paper  what a wormhole is yes when he is leading a flight into outer space a little late doncha think? it gets worse when poor anne hathaway playing as my son said  science girl has to recite a monologue about love and how it can cross all dimensions of space time blah blah blah i really felt for her i wont expand on the plot i couldnt if i wanted to and the last 30 minutes have to be seen to be disbelieved this is not one of those films that you see and forget immediately you will wake up in a few months time laughing at michael caines last scene or his recital of dylan thomas famous lines  not once but twiceand the end oh the end mcconaghey gives it his all having to cry on more than one occasion  believe me i know how he felt dont believe anyone if they tell you you didnt get it thats like saying you didnt get an episode of two and a half men ambitious yes but a turd is a turd  even if they meant to produce a new hybrid rosenegative,let me start by saying im certain i would more than struggle to make a better film i am humbled by the energy love and devotion required to produce the few moments that literally flash before our eyes i also consider myself a huge fan of the nolan brothers following memento the prestige inception all films of exceptional quality and fantastic storytelling for years christopher nolan has worked literal movie magic telling his audience exactly what to expect from the very beginning yet delivering a performance that leaves them no less than astounded interstellar begins no different nolan practically hands the ending to the audience leaving little to surprise but unlike previous masterpieces interstellar drags the audience on a painful bumpy ride through space time love and death leaving some in hypnotic wonder the rest simply insulted wishing for nothing more than to get back the past 169 minutes stay a message delivered by cooper to his daughter across space and time and yes we knew it was him all along stay the message potential viewers should hear loud and clear stay home its safe and warm revisit memento the prestige or inception and marvel at the layered depth of stories told so well you ache for them to be told again and again and again perhaps next time the nolans will deliver on that hope until then stay away from interstellarnegative,let me just say that the plot is good the story seems cool the message is good but when you start watching the movie it just gets worse and worse till the end it is a complete waste of time giving you nothing but a bad taste in your mouth this movie really sucks anyone who thinks this movie is great has never seen a good scifi movie before or is on drugs or being paid matthew mcconaughey keeps mumbling threw out the movie absolutely cannot stand the irritating music that booms on boring things trying to keep you interested in actors that dont even do a good job i mean matt? seems like a amateur everyone seemed very lame and there are no aliens there is no life there is nothing to make you go wow you see the same people doing a lot of nothing hoping they all get killed so the movie will end and the logic the science they screw up on their mission and some of the special effects are worse then 1960s doctor who the only thing good about this movie are some of the great cgi scenes other than that i think it is one of the absolute worst scifi movies i have ever seen so many bad things it would take me a year to write it all down it is a classic movie classic as being top 10 of the worse ever scifi made in the last 10 years how can this crap get such high reviews? it is very low budget bad acting bad everything has anyone ever seen star wars star trek? inception? or apocalypse now? if not watch one of these great movies then watch this total crap movie it should get a  of no more then a 4 at the most but the ruining of the actors makes me give it a 1 on top of all the illogical nonsense especially at the end he goes into a black hole? like his body could survive it? but lets just say he could then multi dimensions to where he turns a clock and then that saves humanity somehow? while crashing into a building somehow looking in a window then somehow they build a colony in space that of course he wakes up to a baseball game which is probably the only reason he agreed to do the movie to them rebuilding his old crappy house back home? i mean what the heck? makes no sense at all how did this movie hack the movie rating system?negative,last year i made the horrible mistake of paying and wasting my time to watch frozen in theaters because i thought it would be a great disney classic like tangled finally i can say that something good has come out of watching the overrated trash that is also known as frozen thanks to my terrible experience with disneys frozen i read the entire plot for this movie before watching it thankfully i ended up saving a few bucks as it was evident that this movie like frozen was not worth paying to watch maleficent was basically a nonanimated nonmusical version of frozen apparently disney ran out of ideas and decided to regurgitate the ideas from frozen with different characters wonderful as expected the main point was a rehash of frozens true love between women is better than true love between a man and woman because it sells well after this movie i can officially say that disney has completely lost its magic we are now to believe that dream guys dont exist in fact all men are either extremely evil or just stupid what happened to the brave prince charming in classic disney stories? disney has deserted them and has decided to start making more realistic movies nowadays and by realistic i mean movies with strong independent females who are clearly superior to the men disneys recent movies make me question whether they are even supporting the concept of true love or dreams anymore i grew up in a time where little girls could dream of finding their kind and classy prince charming but wait the people at disney had an epiphany having high expectations for guys is bad instead lets encourage little girls to dream of being bffs with a sister who ignores her for years or becoming her fathers worst enemys goddaughter instead im just thankful i dont have to grow up watching these lame disney movies i truly find disneys efforts in reversing its reputation of true loves kiss just pathetic hmm cynicism in fairy tales? just what we need as a classic disney lover count me out just a few comments 1 prince phillip used to be my favorite disney prince but here i guess hes just another tool used by feminists to shove their message down our throats 2 maleficent doesnt turn into a dragon yup you heard me whats the point of the movie then you ask? i have no idea also as you have probably already guessed theres no intense battle between prince phillip and maleficentasadragon either just splendid 3 why on earth is king stefan the villain? he was infatuated with maleficent and only married queen leila to take over the kingdom? what on earth has disney come to??? this movie is an insult to disneys sleeping beauty stefan>maleficent #teamstefanforlife 4 last but definitely not least whats up with trying to blur the line between good and evil? yes frozen im also looking at you this is by far my biggest issue with recent disney movies im sure walt disney is rolling in his grave actually since he was cremated perhaps i should say that his ashes are turning in his burial plot? either way you get the idea of all the stirring legends of the triumph of good over evil none has ever been so inspirational to me as sleeping beauty  walt disney i hate to say it but disney is dead walt disney however will forever live on in our heartsnegative,kingsman the secret service  the triumph of bad taste poor script poorly executed the action fake the play of many actors is weak colin firth is good but samuel jackson is ridiculous the music is just noise filthy language in every sentence it left an impression that the people in this movie dont know any language to express their needs or emotions absence of sense of class taste or style the first 5 min was intriguing but the following was boring frustrated my children decided to nap but the typhoon of the torturing noise didnt allow them to relax when the film finally was over people left the room speechless and with relief production of such movies is a confusing message to the youth a terrible disappointmentnegative,kingsman is yet another comic book mess this time about a south london petty criminal who is given the chance to join a private intelligence agency only to find himself fighting against both class prejudice and a mad dotcom genius with an aversion to blood who wants to murder most of the population to save the world from global warming its amusing to see a film be disrespectful about obama and agw but the film is morally repulsive and stupid it wants to be a silly but fun globetrotting adventure like old james bond films but those films had wit exotic travel high living and great stunts whilst this film is crude stuffed with fakelooking cgi charmless and has stupid jeopardyfree action scenes i lost count of just how many times the bad guys goons had the hero in their sights but missed him the promised chav to gentleman transformation never occurs  apparently being comfortable with who you are is what makes a gentleman  with the hero starting as a lout and ending up as a lout in a bespoke suit what really sinks the film though is its lack of a moral compass i could complain about the crudity of having a swedish princess offer anal sex to the hero but the real culprit is the way the film mixes comic book sensibilities with hyperrealistic violence people are tortured and cut in half without a qualm worst of all is a sequence in the middle where a hate church full of people are driven mad and kill each other in an orgy of improvised and graphic violence which is shot like an action scene as if it is entertainment and goes on forever if you want to see colin firth brutally and repeatedly stabbing a woman in the stomach then this is the film for younegative,just seen the film gone girl i really struggled with the book and found it incredulous so never finished it but the film was getting good reviews so i thought id give it a go what a pile of crap two and a half hours of my life wasted the story is just unbelievable neither character makes you like them or hate them they are just bland and well unbelievable by the end i just wanted someone to firebomb the house and kill the pair of them i would have stood up and cheered as it happened it has a really lame ending a waste of my life utter tripenegative,just saw the movie and wasnt a fan interesting premise but i felt some moments it tried to be funny tried to be over the top or even tried to be serious without being interesting it was if the movie was written for specific fight scenes and then pieced together in a rush recommend as a rental but even then it should be low on the list the others i went with had similar opinions with only the argument of which was worse this or jupiter ascending having only seen this one i am rating it a 4 because of the decent acting cool villain and good negative,just like the hobbit movies in which there is 0 real danger for the heroes guardians spends 98% of the time trying to convince you that the guardians are in danger there is no realism no heart to this movie the special ed character i am groot i find to be disturbingkinda like the guy in the ron burgundy movie is he there for laughs? is he there to show that the mentally disabled are just like normal people? conveniently there is no light in a scene so groot just grows pretty glowing light skin flakes from his arm you know for the adult children idiots who liked this film pretty colors tough girl sexy princess check animal character with bad attitude check egotistical smuggler check smugglers friend who turns on him check all powerful bad guy who is betrayed by the next worse bad guy check this movie is a complete rip off of star wars easy escape from detention area check incompetent prison guards check turning off power to escape check i just wanted to puke the action and dialogue belong in a childrens book why does the bad guy hate people? just cause? why does the bad guy suicide his ships instead of use them to shoot down the other planes? why does the bad guy throw people around instead of just killing them because this is a pathetic formula movie with no respect for real adultsnegative,just hate nolan or nolanlovers should i say constant bombardment of science humbug correspondence to theory is not the point contrast it with the silence of 2001 contrast it with the film it tries to imitate now an average scifi story is elevated into the rank of greatest films without even a solid cinematic base except those visuals and effects that become a standard technical expertise you sciencegeniuses all needed this information overload to accept a noteven average story as a cinematic masterpiece how i hope the days come when this movie shall share its honorable place in the dustbin of history alongside battlefield earth or armageddon etc when the nolan fanboys and its industrial franchise fade awaynegative,just dont watch it the movie has plot that has been in some muddle pud for a 3 hours star trek hologram episodes have more sense than this movie its an 3 hour cryfest no sense its not even visually goodugh i want my time back one of the worst movies ever definitely and anyone who says different is lying himself then you this movie has more holes than swiss cheese even prometheus has more logic than this not to mention those ghost whisperer scenes holy god that is so boring drama is expected every 5 minutesevery 5 minutes somebody cries there is 5 minutes of action everything else is just explosion noise and crying and crying and crying and crying just plain horrible mormons have more logic than this movienegative,just could not believe nolan would have created this junk i could hardly see any action sequence and all i get to see is a family melodrama in the name of a scifi movie the plot is good but the movie clearly missed the direction it needed well the concept of space travel gravity wormhole blackhole all looks good in books to know more about it i would have read the brief history of time again or watched more documents on the theory of relativity or blackholes but to bring it out in reality one has to really evolve a lovely plot which was definitely missing in this movie if it was any other director i would have give it a 5 star but i have always looked upon nolan in the leagues of spielberg james cameron or guy ritchie so for all the great expectations and the disappointment all i could give is 1 star sorry nolan half the theater was empty by the time 1 hr flew and i had a take a short nap while the movie was running at a slow pacenegative,just because this movies gimmick was that it was filmed over 12 consecutive years so you witness the kids growing up does not make this a fantastic movie the script was awful and went no where it was nothing but a series of boring unending vignettes strung together to try and tell a story which it failed to do the characters are onedimensional uninspiring bland and apathetic what child when given a birthday giftteenager or otherwisehas no reaction as if heshe is in a permanent braindead coma? how is that just like real life ? those raving about this movie are just those trying to jump on the bandwagon of the emperors new clothes well spoiler alert the emperor is naked they are saying it is just like real life i dont know anyone who acts like what was portrayed in real life no one outside of patricia arqettes one outburst reacts with any kind of emotion passion or pathos i have had more entertaining experiences getting patdowns from tsa at airport security dont waste your money dont waste your time if you want to see a movie about kids growing up filmed over several years watch the harry potter series at the very least you will be entertainednegative,just as with other of nolans flicks this is as pretentious and filled with nonsense how can anyone believe that travelling through a black hole will be as simple as walking though a park? even the visuals weret that great just look at some hubble pics for petes sake the story line was weak unbelievable this movie made a mockery out of everything scientific it is scifi at its worst did anyone notice how this movie was a hack of twister? tars collected the data? like how the mini transmitter things were let go in a twister to transmit data? i find it really disturbing so many people think this movie is close to perfect i was shifting in my seat anxiously waiting for the end this piece of bs is not worth the time and money close to 3 hours of my lifei will never get that back thanksnegative,just another piece of hollywood trash if youre under the age of 8 or youre an adult male who reads comic books youll probably like this if youre a normal adult youll probably think its the stupidest movie youve ever seen it has all the depth and seriousness of kung fu panda the plot is nothing more than a rickety vehicle for a bunch of adolescent snarky jokes and inane dialogue the plot climax in which the main character challenges the villain to a dance off practically screams at the audience ha ha ha you stupid idiots we already got your money seriously this movie doesnt even need joel tom servo and crow  it mocks itself this movie is really just beyond bad if youve ever wondered what it would be like if a faraway civilizations looked like bad nickelodeon shows or b a hollywood producer let his 12yearold son write a scifi screenplay youll find this intriguingnegative,ive never seen so bad movie since indiana jones and the kingdom of the crystal skull how?how can this movie has a rating above 8?? from the beginning of the movie till the end all you see is a mess childish plot childish characters and awful awful humor all the times  even in the serious and important scenes theres always a stupid joke to ruin the momentwhich is already ruined but anyway countless clichs and a story so bad that made me burn many many brain cells the cgi where just ok and the fight scenes were at best indifferentthere were also some slomo scenes with nothing really to offeri mean its like a guy jumping in slow motionseriouslynothing cool about it nothing newnothing about this movie is new or original i have nothing else to say for this moviestay awaynegative,ive never seen so bad movie since indiana jones and the kingdom of the crystal skull how?how can this movie has a rating above 8?? from the beginning of

say for this moviestay awaynegative,ive got to admit that guardians of the galaxy caught me by surprise its rare that a movie turns out to be even worse than i imagined it might be you try to sit through movies like this like battlefield earth or buckaroo banzai or total recall the schwarzenegger version i still havent bothered with the reimagined remake or the fifth element or any one of a thousand others and it becomes nothing more or less than self abuse my government knows no shame proclaims ronan in guardians of the galaxy nor apparently does his studio you know your movies in trouble when the one and only character worth watching for even a nanosecond is a cartoon raccoon named rocky rocket who incidentally has the best line in the movie all of them in a big hurry to get from something stupid to nothing at all pathetic thats called a nutshell review by the way this is just plain sloppy storytelling based on one of the leastinteresting comic books ever to see print and antman is next??? what are these people thinking? theres no rhyme or reason to anything theyre doing forget the lack of continuity this is simply hyping cgi sequences that might as well be cut and pasted on a disc unto themselves without the human elementnegative,ive finally come to see this terrible movie and im still not done shaking my head in disappointment classic tale of pure good and pure evil plus saving the world plus wolf turned into sheep i mean into a beautiful woman burglar with whom the main hero evidently falls in love plus redemption through selfsacrifice plus obliterating all bad guys with a casual ease plus and all these pluses add up to a terribly big minus this is a spy flick even worse and lamer than james bond it is as far from being realistic as it gets virtually nothing that tomcruise does smells like reality watch it if you think that magnificent stunts and burning kerosene and pleasing your twisted need for grandeur are what a good movie is made of the two good things about the movie are the stunts bravely done but absolutely unrealistic for the setting and the soundtrack that is quite decent for these two i give this movie a weak 3 it wasnt worth the timenegative,its outrageously stupid i have read all of the bad reviews currently posted for the kingsman and none of them hit the right mark the movie is violent raunchy campy sexist racist and vulgar and thats all ok but does it have to be so incredibly stupid? honestly does it? and why is the cgi so incredibly terrible last time i checked this is 2015 not 1985 i usually dont care too much for special effects but there is a given level of competence which i expect a film to achieve before it just becomes distracting kingsman has cgi on the level of a cheep syfy channel special feature the acting on the part of the star taron egerton is terrible every time he is on the screen it makes you want to punch him in the face especially every time he opens his mouth same is true about samuel l jackson who played valentine that entire performance felt like samuel l jackson asked him self self how would snl pay this part if they were trying to make fun of me? then he used his fertile imaginations imagined it and played it exactly like that its samuel l jackson acting out a caricature of samuel l jackson playing the role of valentine i think the man seriously is just screwing with us at this point truly a terrible movie not unlike the the league of extraordinary gentlemen only with uk hoodlum playing the main rolenegative,its not a science fiction movie  its  um i really dont know how to classify it other than its full of itself ive watched every science fiction showmovie out there and if youre like me you will be mad after watching this movie you can make a movie if your premise is right for science fiction movies and or shows if you explain the science in a believable way even though its not physically possible you have a chance at making a half decent science fiction movie you can use outrageous theories or whatever to show whats happening on film might be possible well winterstellar they dont even bother to do that and if they have some explanation to their science its like they just got some scientific words and strung them together to make a sentence if you like star trekany of them tv spin offs or movies star wars babylon 5 battle star doctor whoold or new and even 2001 space odysseyboring but well made considering when it was made take my advice and stay away you will loose 3hrs of your life the worst part is you wont be able to explain anything about the movie because it simply makes no sensenegative,its disgusting tom cruise turned a clever fun ensemble show into yet another big effect vehicle for his mammoth ego i could hardly believe my eyes when in the first few minutes cruise his movie i hold him responsible kills off his entire team which consists by and large of far more talented actors just so he can do his lone wolf vengeance thing this time its personal in those few minutes he destroyed any relationship the movie had to the show its a disgrace ive never liked tom cruise but his astonishingly arrogant appropriation and destruction of the missionimpossible theme is a new low aside from this the movie itself is utterly formulaic uniting the implausible with the predictable jean reno is good in anything but no one can save thisnegative,its appalling on every level two dimensional characters shocking acting an utterly fake working class character cynically shoehorned in to broaden the audience demographic an absurd lisp a pure clich_ english gentleman out of central casting and yet another phonedin performance from the reliably awful michael cani havemychequenowplease caine even the violence is tedious its a mark of something truly dreadful when even mark strong looks poor two hours of pure torturenegative,its appalling on every level two dimensional characters shocking

performance from the reliably awful michael cani havemychequenowplease caine even the violence is tedious its a mark of something truly dreadful when even mark strong looks poor two hours of pure torturenegative,its a shame that people are rating this movie so high i registered just to put some sense into imdb i actually dont believe in the ratings of this site anymore possible explanation for a high rating is that people are paid to rate the movie or most people think they are geniuses if they tell their friends that they love a scifi mindblowing movie even though that movie actually doesnt make sense i love nolan but he dropped the ball on this one this has potential but he created a mess out of it a lot of scientific inconsistencies useless characters messy plots one of the most overrated films ever lets bring back some credibility in this sitenegative,it would seem the impossible mission is to find as many ways as possible to degrade an original inspired seriesidea first lets get rid of the jim phelps character so that tom cruises ego has no competitors and he can take over the lead spot in any unfortunate spin offs from this mess second lets forget clever story lines and substitute ridiculous unbelievable special effects cruise must have been made of asbestos to survive the train explosion scene brian de palma directed this ? the originalimf force was a team effort lead by the uncorruptible jim phelps and they relied on brains plus meticulous planning to succeed in their missions each member had his part to play in order for the team to survive and they were the good guys saving us from the bad guys this movie will do nothing for de palmas reputation the final result is a disappointment  more so because in places the movie does get it right and it becomes evident what could have been and should have beennegative,it was awful absolutely pointless without any drama that we can expect from this kind of directors nolan tried to make you excited by visual effect and music but these tricks also doesnt work we can clearly see everything comes from market last year gravity made and worked and matthew mcconaughey comes to media because of one successful series and film and today these two come together for more profit or to just save the humanity  its very funny and this film received high points because it cant even entertain you i think generally saving the world idea like this film is bullshit and wasting the time but i diet think that it can be successful jet in box office like this dont waste your time and dont engage in fake worldnegative,it starts off with a farmer independence day style and then we are quickly transported into a world where the planet is doomed because well were not really sure why but it involves a lot of wind then nasa gets involved and our heroes get sent into a kind of space that comes complete with bad paintings of old hubble pictures lots of space type language and gravity the gravity is ever present nothing ever floats about and they get skipped off the orbit around mars before whizzing past saturn it has rings and arriving at a black hole they get through the black hole like thats possible by looking slightly concerned and talking like cowboys the robots look and act like corn flake boxes the humans mostly well known look bemused and at that point i had to stop watching i was hoping it was all going to turn out to be a joke but it wasnt i dont like ranting so i wont suffice to say that if the earth has to end at least let it explode before hollywood can make another turkey like this embarrassingly badnegative,it started out funny like the previews showed with only a little graphic violence ill give it that then it started getting extremely graphic mass murders heads exploding our whole family of 5 adults were so disturbed we couldnt even talk all the way home we all wish we could unsee it i felt it was a terrible movie even with the few chuckles we got in the earlier parts this movie taught me a lesson i will not be seeing any more movies in the theater without reading every review i can get my hands on this isnt the first time i have been blind sighted by gore and disturbing content if you see this movie i beg you not to take your kids even if they are adults i wish i could go back and not have gone to this one frankly i am disappointed that movie makers feel americans have sunk so low as to find this entertainingnegative,it should come as no surprise that a mindtrip experience would begin in berkeley california— and with a mellow jorma

some smug a**hole who thinks hes smarter than everyone just kicks me in the head spits in my eyes and then call me names i have never felt so insulted by a film but then again i had never bother to watch the star wars prequels the plot is full of holes and the twists and turns are hardly plausible it is true that here are instances good acting can be a saving grace for a bad movie but there is precious little of that in the film the lead characters are unconvincing and tedious bores ben affleck well hes ben affleck sometimes he does decent work but only sometimes the biggest disappointment is rosamund pike i know she is no maryl streep but she is usually not this bad first of all her american accent she talks like she is in some black and white movies from the 50s fine so may be she is channeling some heroine from a hitchcock film but who talks like that anymore okay i am being a nitpicky here my bad her character was supposed to be highly complicated but there was no depth she couldnt even do a halfway decent mimicry of a damaged person its down right pathetic all the supporting characters are awful all except kim dickens she is the saving grace of the film if there is one its wonderful to watch her as the lead investigator of the case of missing wife and the only thing that keeps the movie from flying away like a kite in a wind storm she held on as long as she could all the way until near the end when david fincher ran out of time alas she cannot save this hot stinking pile of garbage somebody please give ms dickens a better position in her career she deserves it the worst one is probably neil patrick harris what happened there doogie? i cannot talk about what is wrong with his character without going into a tirade and spill too much beans so i will stop there doogie stay with comedy please i am glad that not everyone is fooled by this american beautyesque bull doo doo frankly i did not go in with too high an expectation i saw the high rating on imdb but i also heard grumbles that it was not that great the bar i set was in the middle and i still gets crushingly disappointed that is how bad this movie isnegative,it is so pathetic that disneys remake was extremely bad unlike the genuine cinderella movie unfortunately disney in its easy copying of the original movie achieved a total failure the weakness of this film if compared to the previous sequels it would simply appear as a clich disney pictures will rely on heavy advertising in order to attract the audience to see it if you are looking for creativity and an interesting movie this film will not cheer you up if you have much money and you got much free time to waste then all you have to do is see this awful movienegative,it is so pathetic that disneys remake was extremely bad unlike the

right to preserve it sleeping beauty 1959 stands among all disney films because of its great characters incredible art all the landscapes drawn by eyvind earle are legendary and because disney wisely used tchaikovskys ballet  well maleficent has no personality at all i must admit that jolie fits the role perfectly but sadly her character is so bad developed that it hurts king stefan is such an idiot with no depth at all and that also hurts because in the 1959 film he is a good king fanning does not give any charm to aurora the public does not fall in love with her regarding the art direction well at the beginning the film is a kind of dark crystaltinkerbell movie then it turns into lord of the rings it would have been great that this film would have an original art direction to honor the animated film the story is so rushed aurora sleeps like 15 minutes and the she wakes up to help maleficent kill his father and she gets real happy afterwards it is a shame reallynegative,it is incomprehensible to me that i watched the same movie that the majority of reviewers of this movie on imdb seemed to perhaps i was unknowingly sucked into a blackhole wormhole or plot hole that most of the other reviewers of this movie managed to avoid all i know is that my hardearned money was sucked into this monstrosity along with me and for that i am truly regretful like a few other commenters i had absolutely no feelings or connection with any of the characters even hoping at times that they would all fail in their meaningless endeavors a ridiculous premise with outlandish and unscientific bases very little of this movie makes any sense at all it amazes me that nolan was able to draw the acting talent to this waste of time as their considerable skills are completely wasted on this drivel i should note that on several occasions i actually couldnt help but laugh out loud at the absurdity and that fact was truly telling for me mr nolan et al  you owe me two hours and fortynine minutes of my life backnegative,it is beyond me how people can claim the movie to be brainy intelligent well written with all the things i read about the movie prior to seeing it makes it the biggest disappointment ive experienced from cinema in years i give 1 star to bring balance to the current rating in reality this movie is of course not that bad the whole idea behind the plot is that mcconaughey ended up in this blackhole where 5 dimensions were compressed into 3 dimensions and stuff and where he was able to manipulate gravity by sending his daughter the message which was imperative for saving humanity so what in fact happened is through this ridiculously improbable chain of events mcconaughey ended up inside this blackhole all this was apparently the result of a bigger plan all along was there really no easier way for future humansaliens to transmit this data and if they built this timespace warping machine inside the blackhole  means they had access to the data all along? and also means they chose mcconaughey daughter on purpose? so i dont understand what was this purpose? could they not have connected their portal to professors office a long time ago or go for one of the ten billion more rational alternatives? on a side note is it not funny how mcconaughey ignored the message not to go from the same ghost yet followed the rest of the directions? while in the end of the movie he idiotically repeats his feeble attempt had he added its you dad or any other sensible hint he would have saved his daughter years of suffering and maybe a lifetime for himself when he realises this and i dont even want to get into how ridiculous it is that he transmitted data by moving the hands on the watch which was unaffected after being picked up meaning it was hardly gravitational manipulation was it? what was the point of trying to be scientific and trying to explain it in this way then if he could do that he ought to have found a better solution that did not require his daughter 25 years to figure out and anyway they saved humanity by building this massive station named after his daughter by that time they knew what he went through and they still named it after her? why couldnt they have done the same thing on earth? just build the same goddamn station on earth without needing to harvest their gravitational energy bullsh*t bam humanity saved in the same way grand ideas dont make great movies if you cant deliver them properly it is atrocity to compare this to kubricks masterpiecenegative,is it just me or this series is just going down the drain every character is getting awfully whiny as each episode is completed if it goes at the same rate this show will probably take the honours of he whiniest show out there when the show started off i thought it was just laurel but it was understood as almost every story out there has to have someone like that to make sure a segment of viewers stay interested but then there was thea even that was agreeable to a certain extent as shes a confused just out of teens kid but then somehow the lead character oliver begins to whine about everything happening in the city is his mistake instead of doing what he was supposed to do  wthnegative,interstellar was yet another over hyped hollywoodized movie 1010 visuals and an ost that sucks you in but the rest was pseudo intellectual bullshit designed to seem deep if youre on drugs or unversed in the sciences of what it actually talks about those with knowledge in string theory other dimensions or who have an intelligence even slightly above average who dont get trapped by hollywood and consumerism would likely agree it sucks i can in all ernest rate that movie a 310 with only the last 20 minutes of that 3 hour movie being evenly slightly worth watching it would get a 110 if the visuals werent incredible and the acting decent the supposed relationships between characters were awful it was slow paced while simultaneously rushing the only 20 minutes that were slightly interesting despite being pseudo intellectual and was all way to predictable minus the attempt to be deep in the last 20 minutes by trying to connect a 5th dimension to the story line and his daughters ghost in her room which was foreseeable the first second he saw her through the bookshelf weirdness that was a waste of time i want my 15$ backnegative,interstellar was supposed to be a cardinal point for mankind at this stage 2014 as far as technological science go and the perspective possibility or not of a new habitat in space it let me so down instead of a true vision for the future interstellar works out an ordinary hollywood blockbuster that vegetates on emotional blackmail in a father daughter relationship sorry christopher nolan but this is not what i payed for why should man go into space if all he cares about is miserable inter human nonsense? the unprofessionalism of the astronauts is limitless austronauts dont go into space without a strict course so not in interstellar in this movie the astronauts choose randomly with course to take this is supposed to be science? dont make laugh what a drivelnegative,interstellar one of the worse films ive seen in a long time 170mins of self indulgent rubbish slow and tedious does not even begin to describe this $160 million piece of nonsense the horrible church organ hans zimmerman music  often drowns out the dialogue so badly that the sound mix must have been done by helen keller terrible special effects that look like they come from a movie made in the 70s a shameless ripoff from 2001 gravity dark star contact to mention just a few awful wideeyed hammy performances from all concerned a terrible nonsensical script with enormous plot holes and hilariously bad science christopher nolan should never be allowed to make another film again i deeply regret those 170 minutes that this monstrosity has taken out of my life unfortunately theres no wormhole that can take me back before i made the unfortunate decision to see this filmnegative,interstellar is christopher nolans big bigbudget homage to kubricks 2001 except it is not where 2001 robert zemeckis contact which also cast matthew mcconaughey and alfonso cuar„ns gravity used solid science as a launch for deeper philosophical musings interstellar begins with ersatz science and degenerates from there the premise that a planet orbiting a black hole would be a suitable place to relocate earths population after earths environmental collapse is a fatal flaw black holes radiate powerful deadly radiation and everything circling around them are inevitably sucked closer and closer into the black holes crushing gravity somehow the hero cooper gets himself inside the black hole unharmed where he sees myriad display screens of himself at various times in his life and somehow he sends his past self a message the illogic of that circular logic ignores first cause breaks the entire arc of the storyline such as it is then there are illogical subplots like the crew rescues an abandoned astronaut dr mann from death and he repays them by trying to kill all of them for no expressed reason the fight scene between dr mann matt damon and cooper mcconaughey is intercut with something happening back on earth setting fire to a cornfield that doesnt have any apparent connection the sound balance raises sappy music designed to portray emotions like heroism way above the volume of the actors voices the audience cant hear much of what they are saying i thought at first this was a flaw because i assumed that what they were saying would clarify some of the meaningless actions but now i believe that it was just as it was supposed to be gibberish although nolan spent many many millions and some reviewers think this movie rates their highest number of stars i say it is close but not quite the worst movie of all time giving it the title of worst would confer too much attention to this sorry wastenegative,interstellar is a terrible movie three things one the movie is too long two the beginning is boring three it is stupidi never saw a movie this boring before i dont recommend this movie to anyone it does not get interesting till the very end of the movie if you want to see a good movie this is not the movie for you to watch interstellar got so many people wanting to watch it including myself and it was terrible dont watch this movie it is not good i would rather put a stick in my eye then watch this movie again it is boring i never saw a movie that was this badnegative,insipid tepid vacuous the first 30 minutes are the most pretentious script ever written in the history of film making please somebody burn every copy of this film ever distributed to try to sit through this film to its uninspired and tired read lame ending challenges the endurance okay lets start with the actors ben affleck has not made a good movie ie a movie a viewer might be able to sit through since jay & silent bob strike back who forcedcorralled rosamund pike into making this?? who willingly makes movies with affleck besides jennifer lopez?? really? i was sitting on the couch with my wife for the first 30 minutes of this movie and was forced to hit the pause button an physically leave the room for minutes at a time during the first thirty minutes god help america hollywood acting and moviemakingnegative,inception had some problems but its concept stretched the imagination christopher nolans new film delivers exactly what a pessimist would expect if a puffedup batman director thought he could eclipse kubricks 2001 with a puerile adventure story interstellar begins badly and goes steadily downhill as its longwinded prologue introduces the stereotypical elements of a steven spielbergnorman rockwell scifi coproduction  a dying earth a widowed exastronaut farmer his chiseled jaw a feisty daughter a crusty grandpa paranormal activity dust storms baseball cornfields  and lots of corn after about an hour  which seems like two  a valiant crew lifts off in search of a planet to save humanity once theyve journeyed through an intergalactic wormhole the implausibility dimension expands to cosmic heights of absurdity scientific hocuspocus is stirred into the sentimental sludge as gigantic tsunamis deranged astronauts spaceship chases time travel tomfoolery and black hole baloney eventually lead to a schmaltzy hallmarklevel climax the visual effects are above average but far short of awesome when all is said and done the films ludicrous selfimportance and mawkishness leave one rooting for humanitys extinctionnegative,in this movie theres cgi in every shot even cinderellas shoes are but cgi hard to believe yet true i can barely watch so much visual boredom lacking real props in the acting i cant see fairy tale type of acting too i would have expected to see the acting being at least as intensive as in the wizard of oz or cinderfella the actors mimics are close to nothing i dont comprehend on why press reports are reporting cate blanchetts performance as overacting gee if anything else than a botoxed face is already declared as overacting these guys should definitively stop gazing at mannequins im a huge fan of kenneth branagh from his shakespeare movies but this time he set the bar too lownegative,in the opening night i walked out from the movie theater totally disappointed to see one of my favorite directors has diminished himself to such a low lever of performance poorly developing plot immature explanation of astrophysics unbelievable and unrelated events and characters especial effects leveled to a disney comedy and horrible music are only parts of my negative impression even mathew mcconaghey did not seem believable looking at her daughter older than himself mat damon probably did his careers worst acting the robot was another annoying part what did anne hathaway and two other guys add to the story? using a laptop to bring down a drown and control an intergalaxy spaceship??? finding a livable planet after passing through the worm hole in another galaxy seemed easier than finding an atm machine in a us interstate highway why would a director hire a blackholeworldexpert as an executive producer to explain a worm hole function by drawing a line on a paper and punch it with a pencil? just reading the worm hole article in wikipedia would give you much more sophisticated knowledge mr nolan looked completely confused in delivering a solid message awareness of climate changes saving human species teaching relativity theory to common movie goers or the power of love each of them bold and superficialnegative,imdb 82 rating? seriously? this is basically the worst movie i ever seen i am still very sorry for my 3hourinlife has been wasted a week has been passed and i am still very sorry so i decided to write my very first review here to tell people how bad this movie is if i wanna watch a movie i wanna watch movie with plots with happenings with characters development but not a reallifelike  boring pointless film if i wanna watch a reallife something i rather watch a penguin grow old in 12 years with its family and i am sure it will be more interesting than watching boyhood the boy before aged 8 still adorable but once he is in high school he became a puppet with no facial expression and act like nothing worth him for a laugh this movie is long like i have been spending 12 years in the cinema its like forever i literally clapped when its end as i am too excited and over the moon that the movie is finally over boyhood definitely deserved a best picture best picture to sleep on best picture that deserved the worst picture ever best picture to make you feel regret for your 3hoursin life best picture to exchange puzzled eyes with your friends during the whole movienegative,im very disappointed the script the direction the stiff acting by rebecca hall paul bettany and kate mara ive also seen enough of morgan freeman to last two life times please stop already i wish i had my two hours of watch time back so i wouldnt feel so cheated and used poor johnny depp ive seen this movie in one form or the other from years ago junk it up with cgi computer magic doesnt make the script any better maybe the players would be a bit more believable if i wasnt able to say their lines as they were said on the screen the bad guys wereeveryone in my booknegative,im not a fan of comic book heroes and wasnt even familiar with the character before i noticed the pilot listed on tv im down to only two hours of television per week i cant handle any more than that and thought it might be nice to see something new and it would be nice  if there ever was anything new i made myself sit through the whole pilot which by todays standards equals about 40 minutes of programming and 20 minutes of commercials long before it was over i found myself asking a familiar question does it cost less to produce crap than it does to produce quality remember when the commercials during the superbowl were all funny? maybe some of you arent that old but believe me its true they used to be funny why arent all commercials funny? does it cost less to produce stupid commercials? i wonder tv shows used to be creative technical artistic and dramatic a few of them still are ok maybe two of them still are the rest are crap does it cost less to produce crap? i have to admit that my expectations of any new show arent very high but arrow like so many other shows today fall so far short its laughable lets not talk about the oh come on situations like how does a guy come back from a 5 year absence to a lair set up and running with the latest computer technology waiting for his return think about how much technology has changed in the last 5 years how does the heros friend secure a venue for a party at the last minute that just happens to be right across the street from the bad guys office? and how do people who cant act cant write and cant direct get jobs in tv anyways? is the golden age of television really gone?negative,im going to start off by saying that this is the first movie or show that i have ever reviewed and i have watched a lot of them boyhood seemed like a great concept to me and the trailer looked interesting enough to give it a shot but what really made me go to see it were all of these reviews calling it a masterpiece this may have been one of the worst movies i have ever seen if sitting in a chair and watching absolutely nothing happen for 2 hours and 45 minutes is something that sounds appealing to you then i highly recommend this film i honestly have no idea how someone could even call this a good movie let alone a masterpiece or a once and a lifetime experience im legitimately angry that i watched this movienegative,im always excited to see movies that arent what most people consider your average already done hollywood blockbuster but this was so awful i had to write just how much i disagree with all the praise this movie has gotten the idea of filming a boys transition to manhood over 12 years of actual time sounds like a fantastic idea but im afraid that is really all this movie has going for it we follow the main character through his childhood and teenage years i dont know about you but at least for me those were the most exciting and sometimes heartbreaking times of my life i cant really say why the director didnt want to show any of masons truly pivotal moments or his true emotions he just shows us the truly mundane moments and expects us to be amazed at his originality sorry i wasnt in fact i was quite bored mason mostly sleep walks through the whole movie no real emotion about anything happening in his life sure he cracks a smile now and again nothing like the true rollercoaster that is life the other people in masons life are about uninteresting and one dimensional as he is this movie is a one trick pony that doesnt even do that one trick well critics have praised this to the hilt which convinced me to see it i sometimes disagree with critics but have never felt as opposed to them as i do about this film if you can sit through this absolute snooze fest twice you really should get out morenegative,im a huge fan of the original mission impossible television series on which this was based when it was announced that a movie version would be made i naively got very excited with anticipation of seeing it i read every scrap of information published about the movie before its release however when i saw it i was very disappointed this wasnt mission impossible at all but a tom cruise action vehicle i never bothered to see any of sequels its too bad that a whole generation of movie goers will think that this is mission impossible without ever having seen the brilliant television series it doesnt surprise me that greg morris walked out in the middle of this film and said its an abomination because tom cruise has tainted mis image so badly no one will ever make a television show or motion picture that faithfully captures the essence of mi at least not during mr cruises lifetime or mine thanks a lot tomnegative,ill try to be as objective as possible here but unlike the premise of this film you wont be able to travel through a wormhole and warn yourself of the impending waste of three hours first im not a scifi fan but rather was a nolan fan so i did want to give this film a chance i dont claim to be a film expert by any stretch but this movie reminded me of a similar experience with the thin red line 1998 in that the entire film was a play on visual that subsequently lacked substance further the visuals in this film were extremely boring its outer space throw in something to look at even if outside of textbook physics with the exception of the black holes its literally black the entire time or a saturn backdrop they also poured in some heavy s to make an attempt to glamorize the visual effects or lack thereof so earth is dying but they really never get into the whys and hows in an understandable fashion that would help to put into perspective the importance of finding another planet to live on life on earth seems to continue for decades after they start their mission which only exemplifies my point unless einstein himself wrote this script the dialogue in this film is meant to be so overthetop that nobody in the audience is meant to understand it nor question it i had an issue with the character development and lack of justifiable emotion at no point in the film do you really care about any of characters because the storyline goes around like a hulahoop good actors cant make up for their own lack of character development sure cooper cries when leaving his daughter but he is on a spaceship up in outer space before his daughter can grab a tissue to wipe the tears away i think what bothered me most and fits the theme for lack of visual effort were the stupid robots they are basically chrome atm machines with block appendages if i was going to cram a bunch of people and adequate supplies into a spaceship i wouldnt design the robotic assistance to be a huge box that takes up half of the cockpit pure visual lazinessr2d2 was more interesting while being created 30 years ago the more i write and think about this movie the more im reminded of how awful it was this to me was hollywood hyping something up and ripping off movie goers time and moneynegative,ill start this with the good points angelina jolie does an absolutely amazing job as the dark fairy maleficent the various acting jobs range from acceptable the three fairies to quite impressive maleficent and aurora in particular also the effects and design are simply gorgeous the magical effects and creatures are wonderful and just look great now the bad i had really hoped disney was above the trend of gritty rebootsremakes but i have been sorely disappointed the draw of maleficent in the classic sleeping beauty was how incredible a villain she was she was just plain evil by turning her into a character who is not only sympathetic but eventually heroic this movie does a great disservice to the character who invoked all the powers of hell to ensure her victory maleficent watches over the young aurora keeping her safe while the three bumbling fairies maintain *complete* uselessness for the sake of comic relief eventually after she and aurora meet face to face maleficent begins to lament her death curse even trying and failing to undo it by the end of the film one is supposed to be rooting for maleficent because the kingdom of humans is corrupt greedy and evil the king completely insane i cannot imagine what executive thought this would be a good idea but it falls prey to gritty reboot syndrome resulting in something that feels more like character named after the ones in that other movie instead of a different interpretation i dont quite mean to say that the movie should have been exactly like sleeping beauty but it just shows no respect for the classic in the first place dont waste your timenegative,ill start by saying upfront i was only able to tolerate about 15 minutes of the movie being a primarily marvel comic book reader and tv showcartoon viewer since the mid70s im dont care too much for comic book movies as they are not as interesting as or true to the comic book so yes i started watching with a bias but three successive clichs in the first 15 minutes were immediate strike outs for me 01 the dancing to soundtrack while you work scene 02 perfect fighting and comical acrobatics scene 03 the hey thats my property youre impounding give it back scene never mind the overuse of the charm and whimsy of an cgi space raccoon paired with the comic relief of a cgi walking talking catchphrase spewing tree or the deliberate use of a song hit soundtrack etcyawn i think you get the point imo the best comic book movie thus far is watchmen and i dont even read or care for dc comics and no i never read any guardians of the galaxy comics either the movie would have been better done as a cartoon or all cginegative,ill start by saying upfront i was only able to tolerate about 15 minutes of the movie being a primarily marvel comic book reader and tv showcartoon viewer

the movie would have been better done as a cartoon or all cginegative,ill start 1 12 years of wasted time 2 literally nothing happens for 3 hours 3 scumbag stepfathers everywhere 4 the transition from cute kid to an emo kid 5 i only write this cuz imdb requires 10 lines of text 6 12 years of indie rock bands 7 not sure if gay 8 most epic twist in movie history lol jk 9 cant believe its nominated for an oscar 10 best movie to sleep on 11 how to throw away $4000000 12 the boring life of a regular kid 13 unfortunately it didnt get more hd each 20 minutes 14 desperate housewife 15 much feels wow 16 this is why you shouldnt trust imdb ratings 17 shot in 12 years lasts 12 years alsonegative,if you like fairy tales and believe in love then youll hate this film its beautifully filmed and well acted by angelina jolie but the story is so over the top with the male hatred it becomes ludicrous by the end of the film i just started laughing at how insane it was made me think the writer just had to be a woman and she must have suffered the worst break up in history or else she just really hated men i was looking forward to seeing this film ever since it was teased in theaters now i wish i had my money back some may say this film is like frozen thats only if we discovered christoff was actually in league with the evil prince and olaf was their spynegative,if you have technology to build spaceships that go through black holes and technology to make ai machines and robots that look like the monolith from kubriks space odyssey then you dont have to leave earth or any space body since you wouldnt need to any more you just remake the world as you see fit you can stop storms change the weather anyway you like it and grow any kind of food without even planting it you just synthesize all the minerals you need and give them any taste that you would like so the whole idea of this movie is ridiculous and the story itself is so full of plot wholes and just as inception it doesnt make any sense i mean come on some fake scientists writing some fake formulas to solve some fake theorems using some fake scientific methods are you serious? what is this bs???  to tell the truth this movie is nothing but a communist propaganda on a large scale to fool people into believing that life is really way too complicated to make it good for all people are made to think that living in compact spaces in tight spaces in an environment of deprivation is something that is ok and should be taken by people as something normal to fool people into thinking that if they are not going to shrink their living space then they have no chance of surviving they fool people to think that we need to give up life and become just button pressers sitting in small boxes high on fantasy they already have us sitting in our flatsapartments connected to the internet and they feed us a ton of bs every day all day all year and as you see since we have moved in into the cities the bs is getting stronger and stronger with each year and the tighter we are compacted into the cities the level of bs is so high that it just stops making any sense whatsoever have you noticed that all stories now at least the mainstream stories do not make any sense?? everything is so soaked in propaganda that the reality itself is getting destroyed by that propaganda you people should think about it all you who live in small flats and have no life you think about it next time you discuss how great all these movies are you think about how some bs fantasy drama bs moved you how emotional was the experience you think about it and then go back to your tight living space you know what? i dont think you get it the ironynegative,if you ever saw kubricks 2001 then do not waste your time in this movie if you did notthen rent or buy 2001 and avoid this piece of crap interstellar is a dumb and lazy written cash cow disguised as a philosophical statement inception was the same thing but less stupid and more entertaining or at least had more action and violence  do not be fooled by the concept there are just one or two interested statements in this movie but taking three hours for that is excessive the whole things must make sense in nolans depressing mind the world is ending but people is still selfish enough to make matters worse the movie has zero humor and the positive or hopeful message is as fake as the special effects in fact this is a movie about god but nolans refuse to even refer about religion so the movie is about something that is never clear and makes absolutely no sense ***spoiler ahead*** without saying too much about the first ending there is a second happy ending to ensure better box office receipts and is even more absurd  why whoever could create such a device just pass the message and solve the problem ? ***end of spoiler*** mcconaughey is talk is almost incomprehensible anne hathaway is always good but his character is under written jessica chastain has to deal a completely absurd and unbelievable and over dramatized situations and she does not succeed in brief do not commit the same error i made save your money for a better and more sincere money this one is just a scamnegative,if you can look past the horrid acting the more than just lacking substance plot and the under developed characters  this series is for you but then again if you watch something based on the leads sixpack somber mood and distant stares then you will love this poorly created series personally i prefer stories of substance a tale with progress characters and a protagonist that has more going for himher than just a pretty face orand chiseled abs it is hard to believe that arrow has survived critics and audiences and has made it to a renewal of a second season its sad to see quality writing ie smash be removed from channels and hogwash such as arrow be allowed to fill the mind of the average intelligent humannegative,if you are a big fan of the television series starring peter graves and martin landau like i am then you will hate this movie as much as i did it has nothing to do with the television series other than its title and opening musical sequence i went in to this movie expecting more if you can get beyond these prejudices then you can expect at best a mediocre movie right off the top of my head i can pick five or six episodes from the series that were actually better than this movie its a shame because i like tom cruse hes better than thisnegative,if this is what passes for blockbuster entertainment these days then after 50 years of cinemagoing im opting out for good are the filmmakers of the 21st century so devoid of originality that everything has to be a cut and paste from the past? so a brief run through of the tedium that passes for plot from that most dreaded of all auteurs the writerdirector a dude from the past 1988 gets taken into space subhitchhiker galaxystyle and gets to spout substar wars dialogue in a subspaceballs kinda plot i was looking at my watch after the first half hour there was no irony or intelligence in the story the hero takes off his space helmet in the vacuum of space and hands it over to the sourfaced flatchested star trek reboot and they both survive the director could have at least looked at total recall if the physics were too tough for him if they can censor the best part of zulu for alleged raaacism then i truly hope this garbage gets shredded for stupidity and cynicism a sequel is naturally in the works god bless you stanley kubricknegative,if this had been written and played as a straightout dark comedy  and if it had been at least half an hour shorter  perhaps it would have passed as a run of the mill movie but since it has been presented as a serious mystery it has committed the cardinal sin of filmmaking  that of disrespecting the intelligence andor perspicacity of the audience for us the film represents a significant achievement in that it contains more and larger plot holes than any other movie we have ever seen  and weve seen many this was even worse than babel that said  and a warning that reading further will take you deep into spoiler territory  the following is by no means a comprehensive list of the major holes in the plot so ladies and gentlemen start your engines and drive your semis straight through an impressive array of plot stupidity 1 amy buys a car listed on craigslist for cash so theres no record of the purchase how about title and license? where does she keep the car until she needs it? how does she get to it when she needs it without being seen? 2 amy buys lots of tech toys and crams her sisterinlaws shed with them how does she get into and out of the shed without her sisterinlaw who doesnt like her noticing? 3 the shed is where her husband sometimes has liaisons with another woman they dont notice the accumulating gadgets? 4 the gadgets are bought online who is signing for them? 5 when the gadgets are investigated whose fingerprints will be all over them  if there are any? 6 desi is supposed to have broken into the house beat her bloody and kidnapped her theres blood all over the kitchen but none where she would have been dragged out of the house? 7 as he supposedly leaves the house with an at best barely conscious amy desi picks up her diary takes it to her fatherinlaws place and attempts to burn it in the furnace why? 8 how does desi know where amys fatherinlaw lives? 9 several days elapse from the time of the supposed kidnapping until amy winds up at desis lake house can nobody attest to desis being at home during the time he was supposed to be kidnapping amy? 10 what will be made of the video cameras at the lake house not showing anyone there for the first several days? 11 desi was supposed to be holding her prisoner did nobody at the casino notice them there  including the man who thought she looked familiar? 12 where does amys car wind up? 13 phone records i amy makes the anonymous phone call tipping the police off to the contents of the shed no record of that? 14 amy s a hole in one at miniature golf and jumps up and down for joy  which causes her money belt to fall off this apparently was an acme money belt on loan from wile e coyote 15 a couple robs amy of all her money being the psycho she is are we to believe that she is going to let them get away with it? 16 phone records ii what is going to be made of amys phone call to desi? sure it was from a pay phone but isnt it going to raise any flags? 17 amy selfinflicts wounds  supposedly in the bathroom out of sight of cameras  to make it seem as though she has been bound and raped yet wouldnt the cameras show her entering the bathroom without wounds and emerging with wounds? 18 amy winds up in the hospital upon her return they put wristbands on her and one guesses they examine her  but they dont bother to wash the blood off of her 19 do they also fail to notice that there is no evidence of the injuries that would have occurred had she lost copious amounts of blood at the initial kidnapping? 20 nick knows that amy tried to set him up for her murder thus opening him up to a possible death sentence he also knows that when her plan blows up she elects to murder someone who has never wronged her other than being male in order to cover up her actions which until that point may have been criminal  but not capital  offenses why does nick elect to live in the same county as this woman let alone in the same house? i could go on but i realized before the movie was halfway over that i had already wasted too much of my life on itnegative,if they shortened it down to maybe 1 hour and 45minit would be worth two starsbut they didnt as most hollywood movies with overpaid people who cant actthey stretch it way beyond way beyond what they got storyline i havent read the bookand after watching the movie i dont want to either rosamund pike does a fairly good job of being a manipulative cunning bitchbt could just as easy be replaced and affleck does whatever its he doeslook stupid i call itbut others referred to it as acting theres so many plot holes that i wouldnt know where to begin start with all the stuff he supposedly boughtmost stores have security cam these days should be fairly easy too see if he was the one purchasing the items or notnegative,if no one has any objections to the church scene i wonder how they would have reacted when it would rather be a mosque or the greenpeace headquarters this movie shows the exact same thing valentines device did how it could use good music to make you laugh at the most horrible things and think literally it is ok in a way this movie places valentines device right in the theater and shows us our true reactions to horror dished up in the right atmosphere totally acceptable i wonder how we would react because we are aware of the moral wrongness if this music was played and well choreographed in a nazi concentration camp congratulations if you liked the church scene and the scene where the world leaders lost their heads you just experienced the numbing effect the nazi soldiers have felt as they led people to be incinerated full of the music of the fôhrernegative,i would normally not comment on a film that i didnt like because it would be universally panned but when i saw how high the ratings are on imdb i was astonished are there that many people who actually do not believe that men went to the moon or that somehow education for the masses is a bad thing? are there people who think that somehow having more farmers means more food production? if the food supply were to be tittering on depletion it would most likely be because education and scientific research had been discouraged long before there was any food crisis this film begins with the absurd and then proceeds to the unbelievable that down home farmer with the rebellious daughter just happens to be the long lost astronaut who is going to save the world its here that the movie switches from social criticism to fairy tale it is just so disheartening that a film so full of misconceptions and false premises appeals to so many peoplenegative,i wish i have better things to say about this show unfortunately i have none i wont complain too much about the execution of the badly written scripts i have seen them before and i can stomach that to an extent what made me throw cold water on it is its bad acting stephen amell has the most inexpressive face among the guys ive seen playing the lead role the girls who are mostly present for ornamental reasons thanks to the writers also manage to actively support amell in his able job it left me with a feel of watching a bgrade material they had a promising start with the narrative going back and forth between the time when ollie was marooned and arrow fighting injustice in star city i guess thats all there is to it till the end or up until i watched it the plot didnt spend time in developing any of the other characters the lines were not bad but none of them will ever stick with you if one is looking for action entertaining plot or pretty faces it would passnegative, all sent to be chopped to pieces so some brass could get his medal some politician could get elected and so on thats a strong metaphor for a film and thats why i respect tmc as a honest work of art fc lacks any of that artistic integrity this is just pure crass commercialismnegative,i will usually watch any film with johnny depp in it but i wish that i had made this the exception to my rule somehow as soon as this film began i knew i was in trouble call it an intuitive sense based on the number of films ive watched or whatever but the truth is i was correct it is a tremendous waste of exceptional talent in a film that is way beyond preposterous i can deal with expanding what is believable but this film presents it in a way that is incredibly not interesting i found myself not caring within 30 minutes actually to make a scifi film so lacking takes a certain kind of talent its a shame because the genre is screaming for intelligent wellmade movies its also a cruel joke to fill it with so much top talent and then waste it with so poor a script johnny depp could not look more bored and one of his over the top performances might have helped herenegative,i will preface this by saying that i have not read the books i did see the first movie and actually enjoyed it i usually watch movies such as this with a skeptic mind and the first one wasnt bad this movie however was terrible heavy spoilers roasting over an open fire to follow ive heard that the movie deviates almost unforgivably from the book if thats the case i cant speak for the book but the movie script looks to have been written by a highschooler at best the movie is riddled with clich_s main character with a dark inner battle raging due to prior decisions made boring people and armies showing up just at the perfect time forgivable once not around the 5th time bad guys who couldnt hit a target 20 feet in front of them while shooting an automatic weapon man those guys suck and the ultimate faked death with poisonparalysis scene wow that whole scene was bad throughout the whole movie the main character the annoying tomboy girl tris keeps being painted as tough and deadly she is neither of these in fact she is quite laughably the opposite could her personal trainers not put her through some weighttraining classes? her hairstylist was definitely present as her hair looked like she just stepped out of a hollywood salon right after the scene where she cut her own hair with a pair of rusty scissors it looks like she couldnt even do 10 push ups yet she was fighting people and saving people falling over ledges with ease but she looks like a huge wuss her little girly grunts and squeals she made when fighting or doing action made me bust out laughing and the scene where she breaks through the glass is meant to be badass and instead just left me hoping she would bounce off the glass and fall flat on her back man i wanted to laugh so bad and probably the most unforgivable part of this whole movie was how pointless everything was examples they fight the factionless on the train killing several and doing serious damage to many more not really sure how because tris fights like a sissy girl then the main character four says his own name and the leader of the vagabonds through bloodied teeth is like oh we cool bro never mind you just headbutted me in the face and killed my friends the hell?? oh and triss brother is a huge pussy they continue to fight hard and kill people to narrowly escape the perfectly uniformed drone guards of the capital so that they can go in to hiding then the main character just gives herself up i think it was because the villain was threatening to kill innocent people with her mind control devices never seen that before but it doesnt really matter then shes given the chance to escape by her double double crossing friend didnt see that coming and yet she chooses to stay to open the mystery divergent box well what was the point of anything if you wanted to open it anyway?? i was dying to contain my frustration also how does the evil capital lady have this perfectly built divergentboxopening proprietary chamber system complete with bulletproof glass and mysterybox holding pedestal just already set up? does no one question this stuff??? and to top it all off the supersecret mustbepreservedatall costs message in the box the entire point of the movie divergents are cool dont ostracize them oh and the rest of humanity is living outside the wall cheers what? no one has bothered to check this whole time?????? gag enough roasting to conclude lots of movies even good ones have clich_s and information that you are just supposed to assume but this movie was genuinely terrible maybe all the people reviewing this with an 710+ saw a different movie than i didnegative,i will give this movie a 1 for visual effects only 1 because the director put the emphasis on these but stole ideas from avatar and man of steel  the flight looks cool doesnt it? other than that the movie is sending confusing messages to the ignorant people of our times who dont know that maleficent means one who does evil so  in anyones opinion  how can an entity that looks like a devil fairies dont have devilish horns and dark colored wings with ugly horns on them and is called one who does evil named from birth not after she suffers the deception how can such a person be presented as kind? honestly?? its something new from disney  to have a voiceover say in such a gentle voice hello dear stupid audience  heres our dear devil that we want you to love she looks ugly but try to love her love her horns love her ugliness love her evil name love her companion whos also named like a devil this is the new kind of love that were telling you its the real thing its in tune with the youths love for vampires werewolves and ghost stories that so many have fallen in nowadaysnegative,i went to watch this movie expecting it might be a decent scifi movie but it turned out to be yet another terrible crap here are the few reasons why i found it crap 1 if a guy fell in a typhoon a usual earth disaster it is most probable he will die but mr coop is made of some different material the guy went inside a black hole where matter collapse beyond nuclear and quark level but he comes out in one piece with all his consciousness intact this very presentation by nolan just cheapened the depiction of a black hole 2 so top notch team was sent out by nasa yet they cry and whine about so small issues like oh i want to see my daughter back even at my company of 16 people we act more professionally seriously people buy whatever crap is fed to them in the name of nolannegative,i went to this movie expecting an incredible masterpiece as advertised on a saturday afternoon there were about 25 people there i was so very disappointed this movie went on and on and on so much so that i continued to look at my watch wondering when this movie would end would it ever end?? and then it kept going while the idea of filming over a 12 year time frame is unique and very clever the film just needs major editing its the story of a boy growing up there was abuse which was painful to watch but basically the film was just too slow paced and boring it goes on for almost 3 hours so take a meal with you if you decide to go despite these alerts it is just slow long and boring i seriously considered just getting up and leaving and asking for my money back i wasnt sure if everyone was in the same pain i was but i also considered standing up and yelling when will this film ever end?negative,i went to this film and all i can say is it was the longest technical demonstration of bullshit i have ever seen im having a hard time writing about this film because i honestly wish i could forget about the film the film has its strong points and those are visually appealing cinematography and an impressive use of sound the negatives of this movie are however to many to put in a single review the film has an alright beginning and the build up of the characters is done pretty well and you get to see matthew mcconaughey do some wonderful acting however none of the characters were developed enough for you to care for them however the movie jumped around so much from plot to plot that your emotions got shocked when very predictably a character gets killed but then the story moves right along with a nice action scene thrown in to keep you awake the movie is full of quantum physics jargon that no one could possibly follow the jargon is about an hour of the movie and i have a fairly basic grasp on physics having taken a few college physics courses but i can say for a fact that many of the things might be true out of context but in the frame of the movie didnt make any sense im not writing anymore in this review i just recommend you go see another film it felt like a waste of a good night to me but judging by the reactions of all the people in my theater you will probably find it a confusing a deep trip into breath taking quantum physics induced acid tripnegative,i went to see this last night with my wife in a screening and we both thought it was total tripe it was a brainless movie with terrible acting story and script even the special effects were done badly the story was absolutely rubbish and it was also far too violent the violence in this movie is so extreme it will make many people uncomfortable  i normally have no issues with violence in movies however this was totally and unnecessarily excessive there was also sadly the usual braindead racial stereotyping propaganda and ignorance in the movie as has become the norm for hollywood movies and some of the acting was so bad it was beyond laughable i have never seen acting as bad as samuel l jacksons acting in this movie and i also have no idea why people like michael caine agreed to be in this rubbish this film has been totally overrated by the media and has had ridiculous blanket advertising in most uk cinemas its sad to see this kind of rubbish getting so much financial backing and being forced on people  there are so many good movies which get no advertising or support this is seriously one to avoidnegative,i went out of the movie theater with mixed feelings i love scifi i would have like to travel to other planets not anymore i wanted to like the movie so much that my brain forgot most of the bad side of it first i said to people that interstellar was only for scifi freaks that it was not a feel good movie pretty damn dark and depressing but it was overall a good movie but my love of scifi had block all judgment after talking to other people who saw it my view of the film change radically here are why  1 have you seen stupidest robots than in interstellar 2 the pilot farmer daughter saw gps coordinates in dust yeah right and they goes to those coordinates and find nasa bunker they are abducted by the nasa and the nasa chiefs tells the farmer  you are the one we were waiting to pilot the spaceship that will save humanity even tough the nasa didnt sent the dusty coordinates wtf 3 the extra beinggodor human of the future had placed for humans a wormhole near saturn why so far? 4 they went to a sea planet to rescuesee those sent before that is a sea planet with no ground to plant foodanimals not a good choice and they couldnt see the giant waves from space? 5 they went to a ice planet to rescuesee those sent beforeice planet without animalsplantswhats the point so close to a black hole that a few hours on the planet = 23 years to the spaceship in orbit is that a good choice to try to establish a colony on a ice planet near a black hole? 6 the spaceship is relatively small we could see the 2 shuttles and the ring that create the gravity inside the ship there is the machine to create babies 10010000 ? fertilized human eggswithout ? the incubators if you find a planet yes to the babies but the spaceship so small that the foodbaby milk would be out quite soon 7 have you seen so bad cryogenic bed? a kind of trash bag that wrap you up 8 nobodys really knows whats inside a black hole but nolans view is ridiculous add that the the farmer go out of it and survive to find is old wrecked house inside a giant spaceshipnegative,i went into this movie with decent hopes given the high rating it had but its not like i was over expecting or anything in the end i found this thing a total a mess i think for me it tried to ride too many lines and as a result failed in most aspects it tried to take itself serious as a spy movie yet it also tried to be this weird comedy and while i think movies are capable of doing both this one just didnt do it well or right to the point where it just bounced me out of the movie completely far as it taking itself seriously i found it to be way over the top unbelievable and unrealistic to the point of being stupid far as the comedy i just didnt think the nuclear head explosions or the mcdonalds being served on a silver platter was funny at all granted im american and i get that english humor is a bit different but i love monty python snatch mr bean even most of the bond films yet most of the funny moments in this movie i just found remarkably unfunny to the point where rather than it being a quick laugh it just completely bounced me out of the movie and the few comical moments that were actually funny were already covered in the trailers so for me this movie totally fell flat on the comedy scale to the point of actually hurting the movie now on the taking itself seriously aspect the whole spy gig the young recruit it just failed on that level for me as well certain aspects of the action scenes were done well and some of the bullet time action was good but i thought the editing needed a lot of work the massacre in the church i just thought was way over done and too long i find it amazing in movies like this how fight scenes go on for many minutes and when its all done people are barely winded breathing normally give me a break go watch professional boxers or mma fighters and see how they look after just one round and they are real athletes who train vigorously so while some of the action was okay it was so over the top that again it bounced me out of the movie so between the bad comedy and overcooked action i was constantly being reminded that i was watching a movie rather than be swept up into one my last beef is with the main kid and the whole recruitment  training camp probably what bounced me out of the movie the most was here we have some reckless rebellious kid whos training to this point has been gymnastics so okay hes flexible has good balance etc yet with little to no further training at all hes the biggest bad ass? the recruitment  initiation program was a joke it wasnt a training program of any kind it was basically lets throw these kids in a no win situation and see how the fend and who comes out on top i get the idea was they were trying to weed through all the recruits to get the best one but the whole while i kept thinking so this kid is just a natural born bad ass because he did gymnastics and has daddy issues? then once hes out and starts real life spy work hes untouchable and better than all the worlds master assassins its like her moms bf who bullies him early in the movie who he confronts in the end and im thinking so other than being this super spy what has he done to actually improve his skills as a fighter? overall i thought the action was decent but very over the edge of what youd consider to be believable movie believability i mean the black comedy was pretty flat and did very little in making me laugh or enjoy myself finally the believability of this kid taking over for his dad and his quasi predecessor was just absurd i give it a 3  10 one point on principle and because i liked the main spy girl a 2nd point because some of the action was decent and a 3rd point for the best part of the movie which was the bare ass scene at the end which shocked me enough to yell out hellonegative,i went into this movie thinking it would be a nice movie from disney since i had heard it was a darker adaptation from the classic sleeping beauty from the perspective of the villain and i still think its a great idea and still expect to see the same thing with other classics even if in this case the idea was very poorly executed starting with the director it was a risky bet by disney because robert stromberg had never directed a movie his work is almost exclusively visual effects and it didnt pay off even though he did a good job adapting from the original story there were some parts where the story and some actions from the characters didnt make sense at all then the acting was also sad bad acting from the three fairies lesley manville imelda staunton juno temple and from all the male characters especially sharlto copley angelina jolie did a good job not her best of course but a solid acting the idea of maleficient was to tell the story of sleeping beauty from the perspective of maleficient but it didnt even give depth to the character there are holes on the story and that hurts it pretty bad the images and effects were also very average and not good enough for 2014 overall the movie wasnt appealing at all and the story acting and effects were weak however i applaud the idea and hope disney learns from this movies mistakes and do more of these kind of movies but much betternegative,i went in with low expectations but nothing can prepare you for such a dreadfully uninspiring convoluted ass numbing experience matthew mcconaughey is totally miscasthardly audible at timesterrible southern droll there is so much crying in this film he cries his daughter cries the scientist cries the insert villain cries this film treats dangerous black holes like an elevator journeytheir dangerous magnitude and awe is lost and ignored in a few short scenes the colour pallet for this film is washed out greys dull and lifeless the 2 planets they visit are so badly realised and uninteresting you can hear several astronomers and physicists weeping in their homes and hanging up their lab coats christopher nolan is on a mission to devolve the human race with total nonsense its just awful another space film ruined by a weird crazy space odyssey endingto be honest the film lost me long before that the robot is terriblelike something clunked together from lego by a 4 year old every scene with it in made the audience cringe or laugh 165 million dollar film with some of the worst effects ive seen on the big screen in years the camera angles were baffling especially following the shuttles in and out of orbit they were filmed so closeit was like the director knew they were st and said its ok guysill pan to a member of the crew crying i didnt care about any of the charactersnolan is just awful at conveying human relationships awful script writer with his brothernepotism at its finest im still recoveringshockedim done with nolanthe dark knight rises was awful inception was awfulthis is just the icing on the cakethis should have been a space exploration film wowing the hard paying audience with its gripping story and dazzling effectsin the end its just total toshlifeless boring and self indulgentnegative,i watched this painfully boring movie to the end  all 2+ hours of it everything in the film rang false i am not as erudite as some of the negative reviewers here but they are not lying i hate movies that try to press the same fake emotional buttons over and over again parental guilt love duty heroism blah blah blah this movie does it at every turn until you cant stop groaning the suspension of disbelief what every work of fiction aims to achieve once that stops working youre in trouble no you cant drive a truck at top speed with a flat tire through a cornfield without losing control no corn is not harvested by a combine and left lying on the ground when it is green then there were a lot of scientific facts that were ignored or glossed over about space travel im not a scientist but there were many times when i said wait what that doesnt sound right anyway i think i reached the minimum number of characters so i can stop do not pay to see this movie enough saidnegative,i was very much disappointed by this flat action movie and its predictable ending i am a fan of the old missionimpossible series of the 60s and 80s and therefore i think the plot is ridiculous at best why should jim phelps do what he did? he was always loyal through the many episodes of the series and there he could have gotten much more money if he had betrayed his team the reason why peter graves jim phelps did not star in this movie is because he did not agree with what i have just said anyway this movie is not for fans of the series because there is nothing left of the teamwork spirit of the series it is a one man show for tom cruisenegative,i was very disappointed with this film i cannot understand why anyone would complain about the complexity of the plot compared to an average episode of the tv show the story was simple meaning that one action follows the other and nothing really unexpected happens in other words it is very constructed and you can sense it for example the way in the terminal room is much too easy i think in a tv episode the writer would have invented much more tricks the thing that might make the film hard to understand may be the way how the simple story is told in addition to that some scenes are so illogical that they are already silly for example the helicopter in the tunnel not to mention the often criticized fact of making an arch villain out of jim or the stereotypic dialogues i will not spend a cent for watching part 2negative,i was very disappointed after seeing this movie especially after having read so many positive reviews the portrayal of physics and astronomy here is so pseudoscientific and so preposterous that i found myself constantly sighing or scratching my head all throughout the movie i dont have a degree in astronomy or any other science field for that matter but the scientific freedoms that this movie takes are so incredibly blatant and obvious that even i found myself bothered by them even for a scifi its far too liberal in this regard but thats not the only problem with this movie the characters are paperthin and the way events unfold is often irrational or portrayed in a very contrived manner for example an ex nasa pilot stumbles upon a secret nasa base which he found by interpreting strange dust formations into binary code which he then somehow immediately knew were map coordinates  makes so much sense huh? where he is immediately offered to pilot their only rocket which is to save mankind and is to launch the following day because all their pilots are inexperienced and have only flown in simulators whereas the protagonist has flown before many years back and only barely leaving the atmosphere but thats fine theyre sure he can manage an intergalactic journey involving many years of travel deepspace hibernation traveling through a wormhole and finding a new world to save mankind no need for any training or a medical check of course surely hell be just fine he just needs to show up tomorrow for the launch incredibly when our hero performs the greatest feat of space exploration ever  traveling through a wormhole he and his crewmates just play it cool the feat is given no more significance than a casual stroll through a park there are quite a few other examples too where the plot is painfully contrived and makes the whole movie difficult to take with even a bit of seriousness another thing that completely broke the immersion was the very unscientific language that was used all throughput the movie a movie that was supposed to be about space exploration and science youd have to be mentally challenged to actually believe that this insultingly simplistic chitchat resembles anything close to actual scientific language that high level nasa scientists professors and engineers would use this is nothing short of an insult to our intelligence ill end by saying i really fail to comprehend how people claim this to be the best scifi movie ever it seems to me that were stooping lower and lower in our expectations of what makes a film great its almost a standard now to expect a movie to be bad when reviews are surprisingly positivenegative,i was so utterly disgusted with one scene that it compelled me to write this review my first oneever okay so to begin with i thoroughly enjoyed the film prior to the last 20 mins it was highly entertaining humorous in bits and the lead actor did an amazing job i did feel however that due to the amount of foul language and over the top violence in one particular scene at a church that it lost one point this movie wouldve made it on my top rated list so youre probably wondering what was so terrible that it completely ruined the movie for me so let me tell you now bear in mind that i am a woman in my mid 30s and not conservative by all means but there is a scene in the movie where eggsy the main character is propositioned by an imprisoned princess what is so wrong with that you ask? nothinghad she not offered her ahole in exchange for him saving the world why? it completely took me off guard and cheapened the entire film it was completely unnecessary and utterly distasteful such a shame because it was such a great film toonegative,i was really excited from seeing the review  on here and all the hype i had heard from other people via social media i eagerly pressed play the initial opening scene was quite intense and moving and i was quite taken aback by how that went i wondered if this level of intensity would set the bar for character development throughout the film and i was immediately grasped my illusions were soon dashed as the film fast forwards to when the boy is grown up and is stealing an item he is most definitely not grown up and a complete idiot i guess this bit is meant to appeal to 6 yr olds? it is almost as bad as trump jokes i cringed i let it slide and hoped for better it got exciting when the chase scene was happening then they went to prison then they broke out and then they tried to sell the item that pretty much summarises the whole film the main protagonist is a buffoon who swears a few times for good measure kids watch this film the only character that seemed to develop was draxx as he reflects on his poor choices the bad guy isnt even scary  he doesnt do that much compare the bad guy to loki and the difference is infinite no character development apart from a 1 minute scene with draxx the annoying rocket character that had zero impact a non entity villain a weak weak weak plot line and the dialogue was so flimsy in fact most of the characters flip flopped around in reasons to do things that didnt really make logical sense the only saving graces were the planet scenery and make up i hesitate to say the cinematography as it was cgi the worst bit out of many was where the racoon decided he wanted a mans prosthetic limb to escape the prison and then sniggered about how he wanted to see the guy hop about  i actually found this really offensive and dont want my children to think that is a funny and b ok the best bit was the soundtrack overall a very disappointing disjointed film it felt as jarring as star trek into darkness coupled with star wars jar jar binks and a smidge of the goonies but nowhere near as goodnegative,i was looking forward to seeing this film but the points i would give it is nothing out of 10 everything about it is remarkable in its awfulness writing acting absolutely unconvincing and you knew what they were going to say before they said it i hope that is not the american way of life because its unreal the word they use throughout the film is awesome and whenever even the tiniest thing like batting a baseball ended up with the high five i would have been better off weeding the gardens and growing swede it would have given me a great deal more pleasure it is a film i wouldnt say is a turkey but a massive pork pie with plenty of jelly even that sounds quite nice i am always thoughtful about films i love films and the film that leaves the memory lingering is jet boy a remarkable canadian film i would give that 8510 if anybody wants to waste their time in totality get this film for £10 remember you have been warned i put the film straight in the firenegative,i was genuinely excited to hear that disney was going to make a film about maleficent my favorite disney villain of all time i was interested in knowing the why behind her actions in sleeping beauty since we never really got to see that i will say that the cinematography is amazing i will also say that while angelina jolie was not my first choice she had the look her costume was spoton and there are moments where you can see where she is at least trying to play this role correctly and really who could replace eleanor audley? but one thing ive noticed over the past 1015 years is that animation and design seem to be their main focus rather than story or character development in the movie maleficents back story was incredibly rushed so much for going into depth on why maleficent is the way she is this movie does not explain why maleficent is the way she is disney is showing us a completely different character while giving her the same name as disneys most iconic villain now theyre trying to say that maleficent is a misunderstood character who becomes evil but that never happens she becomes angry and bitter but not evil maleficent in this movie is not even a misunderstood sympathetic character she is a total victim who never becomes evil at all oh she does do one evil thing she does still curse king stefans baby out of revenge and she has second thoughts about it two seconds afterward see? not evil at all and while im at it i should mention my distaste for the way she cursed aurora disney completely lowered the stakes by having maleficent utter the words sleeplike death and be the one to offer the cure of true loves kiss no its merryweather that counters the death curse in order to save auroras life oh maleficent may say later that she doesnt believe true love exists but thats a matter of opinion isnt it? again lowers the stakes and what was linda woolverton thinking when she took king stefan and the three fairies completely out of character and gives them a complete 180 in order to make maleficent look good? if youre going to show us the point of view of a famous villain its okay to give them layers and gray areas in order to make them more interesting and multi dimensional even to show they werent always evil but not to say they were never evil at all that just completely defeats the point of the character same with the good guys they may have their own flaws show that they have their own prejudices or that everything they did wasnt perfect but not to say the good guys were really evil or stupid the fairies flora fauna and merryweather i refuse to call them by their new names are nothing like they were in sleeping beauty and this is a big deal in sleeping beauty say what you will about their flaws but their ultimate motivation was keeping aurora safe at least they tried even if they failed maleficent 2014 portrays them as nothing more than stupid buffoons who only care about saving their own skins aurora was just a means to an end for them they have no relationship with her like they do in the original the movie also took away their own personalities so they are no different from each other i cant even keep track of which fairy has which name watching them on screen with everything they say or do was as cringe worthy as i expected it to be king stefan has to be one of worst written villains i have seen in a while he has no real motivation for what he does we see him as having nothing in the beginning and then the movie glosses over his relationship with maleficent in order to get to the good part where he steals her wings in order to be king after that he wages war on maleficent for cursing his daughter and yet he only looks at aurora as afterthought property why is he even after maleficent then? what else has she done to him other than cursing his daughter? elle fanning as aurora was very impressive i do think she gave the character more of a personality that was lacking in the original and she stole the film in every scene she was in unfortunately that wasnt enough to save the movie nor were maleficents interactions with diaval as enjoyable as they were and of course maleficent does not turn into a dragon in this movie i have to ask why disney? you knew how loved of a villain maleficent is and her being a dragon is one of the many reasons why also we live in an age where technology and special effects are abundant you didnt use the opportunity to see how your most iconic villain looks as a dragon when done with liveaction cgi? why would you waste a perfectly good opportunity like that? besides the fact that maleficent is not evil in this film she also is very wimpy and pathetic she cant do anything when we see her fight an army at the beginning all she does is fly around and slap a few soldiers with her wings the tree monsters did most of her fighting for her in sleeping beauty she could transport herself to another place in a matter of seconds she could shoot lightning from her staff and she could transform into another form other than her own she didnt do any of that in this movie just like with alice in wonderland disney wasted a perfectly good opportunity to effectively adapt their animated work to the liveaction screen maleficent may not be the absolute worst movie ive seen but its definitely in my bottom list nownegative,i was extremely excited to see this movie when it came out boy what a waste of excitement angelina jolie was terrible i swear she only had about 30 lines in the whole movie most of her scenes were of her posing in her costume and looking or trying to look evil stick with the original sleeping beauty movie if you want a movie with an actual plot whoever made this movie focused on what it looked like and the cgi more then the actual acting which was horrendous the whole movie was just eye candyabsolutely no depth to it whatsoever no more angelina jolie movies the woman cant act at all all of these big blockbuster overhyped movies have no depth or plot its like they put all of their energy and money into the visual appeal of the movie and said to hell with it when it came to the actual acting and plot such a shamenegative,i was expecting a lot more from this weak and slightly laughable movie johnny depp is literally sleep walking he has all the presence of a cardboard cut out and seems like he just doesnt care depp plays dr will caster a genius who takes technology all the way by working out how to upload a human consciousness into a quantum computer well lots of them a terrorist attack sees the doctor poisoned with weeks to live so his wife evelyn rebecca hall and best friend max waters paul bettany do the unthinkable they upload him this idea is not new there have been other films with a similar idea and also a twilight zone episode the character of joseph tagger morgan freeman could have been played by anyone as the character had no substance what so ever and freeman was predictable and unchallenged there is a ghost town that ends up home to the doctors mega lab locals made invincible and joined like the borg on star trek the entire government is represented by one man the army by a few more the terrorist wind up working with the good guys to stop the doctor never mind that they where the ones who killed the doctor in the first place well his body anyway its silly and it ends badly but not too soon for menegative,i was anticipating this movie as i was an ardent fan of the original series and the remakes in the 80s what a major disappointment this was the film begins ok but then it all falls apart and becomes just another run of the mill action movie using the same format that hollywood churns out so often cruse is totally misscast and unconvincingthe point of the series was its cleverness and the fact that you could not work out how they would do things this was just the biggest disappointment on film i have seen apart from the even worse 2 follow ups i am sure many younger movie goers would like this film simply as an action film but mission impossible it is not and jim phelps turning traitor? pleasenegative,i was actually intrigued by this movie a spy movie with action and comedy i love those types of movies the beginning started out good i actually liked this movie until all the killing dont get me wrong im not one of those antikilling people movie type person my problem with this movie is that the killing distracted me from the story the story lol especially the fireworks scene in the movie yes the special effects were cool in all but come on fireworks? when youre gonna kill a bunch of people you turn it into a fireworks show that part completely ruined it for me onto the story i got the basic plot of the story but once again the killing kept distracting me away from the story in conclusion the movie had a lot of potential but did not live up to my expectations i do have the admit cinematography was actually pretty decent compared to the rest of the filmnegative,i waited with great anticipation for this movie and was sorely and truly disappointed i dont understand where the 10 reviews came from? what planet were they on perhaps they were from viewers from the other side of the worm hole or black hole i have been a sci fi fan for many years but this movie took a leave from all logical or good sci fi explanations plot was ambiguous storyline convoluted technology was not linear one sees a 20th century saturn v lifting the crew up to a 22nd century space craft sleep pods with crew jumping into them like they are going for a nap exploratory craft that operate like a star wars movie landing on a water world with some silly time dilation theme that doesnt affect craft in orbit? cant these people survey the world from orbit? black holes 5 dimensions with metaphysical connection shameless referrals to 2001 it was embarrassing on and on for way too long han zimmers music  was good with a few good special effects but that was itnegative,i vote 110because its awful to compare other marvel movies hulk is good  iron man 123 are great captain america 12 and avengers are awesome thor 12 and this are bad at logic unreasonable for adult if this movie is for 012 kidsand not marvel presents i will not say anything and wont recommend any friends to see it in my impressionmarvel is a very good movie maker and always surprised me but this and thor 12there are very serious logical problems to make you feel vulgar there are tons of good movie on imdb top listfor kids if you think this is marvel presents watch this just waste your time and money i am very doubt it how to get 80+ point on imdbnegative,i

and money i am very doubt it how to get 80+ point on imdbnegative,i usually love slow burning character driven movies where the plot moves at a pace that dictates character development and depth then i realised that there was still over 1 hour to goand nothing had happenedand nothing looks like it will happen and i dont care what happens just make it stop so i didi stopped watching now i am relieved because moments agoi turned into peter finch and began raving im mad as hell and im not going to take this anymore im mad as hell and im not going to take this anymore im mad as hell and im not going to take this anymore what is the point of this dribble mascaraing as a movie i dont care what happens to the boy the mom the sister or that dad i am not wasting one more precious second on this meaningless reality fantasy pretending to be interesting or clever or arty i hated this negative,i usually dont write these reviews but i am so antiinspired and this way would like to warn people if you dont like first 10 mins everything later will be even worse i thought that skyline is worst movie ever but after watching this one i am really not sure the plot doesnt lead anywhere almost all characters have horrible personalities they are absolutely stupid and not capable to to lead their lives scenes are lasting too long and for many i find no reason of including them to the movie the movie lasts too long and it is so frustrating and irritating that after watching it you realised it was total waste of time just dont make the same mistakenegative,i used to watch the 80s series remake of mission impossible and feel this movie is largely mission impossible in title only its really just a big star vehicle and moneymaking enterprise for tom cruise sure its an entertaining mindless romp that will keep your brain happily in neutral for a few hours and that may be all youre after the revelation of who is the true villain will anger some fans such as myself it really wasnt anything like the 80s mission impossible i remember what about the comraderie between characters? what about the team effort thing? these things are missing because its tom cruise vs the rest of the world the best thing about the film is larry mullen jnr and adam clayton from u2 being on the soundtracknegative,i understand the appeal of superheroaction comic stories the good guys are purely good and noble and selfsacrificing and easy to pick out because theyre really good looking and wed like to think of ourselves as those things or potentially those things if we could just get around to putting down the doritos and remote and having a meaningful job and life the bad guys are just as easy to pick out though many of them are good looking too in this version of the ofttold tale at some point though we grow up and all this comic book ethos is revealed to be a ridiculous and childish take on a complex human world where no one is purely good and few are purely evil but its still appealing to some level of us thats still stuck in our childhood moral upbringing where ma and pop told us about right and wrong and we still wish it were that simple and clear and that bullies got their comeuppance some people never grow up and see this sort of thing for what it iswishful simplistic thinking others know what it is but find it appealing anyway for the part of me that is such a person a couple stars for doing a decent job of it in this show this show is also full of extremely good looking people any heterosexual female is going to dampen herer palms watching this the action scenes are unevensome pretty good and interesting and some fakey and in violation of the laws of physics the presentday plots are utterly predictable the resolutions simpleminded as is the romance the backstory scenes were interesting in the first few episodes but paled quickly as of this writing the show has gotten repetitive already minus three stars for immediate fake negative votes of the first version of this review in case the shows makers paid for those which is a sleazy practice i watched all the shows said to be the best of the fall 2012 season for at least two eps each and this is indeed one of the better ones but its not actually goodnegative,i truly believe that all these giant user reviews with 10 stars are just paid to review it this movie is a massive disappointment seeing it again will not change anything its just down right boring it is over hyped to no end do not waste your time and money seeing this in the theater this movie has a rating up near the shawshank redemption it does not even come close to being that good of a movie when the shawshank redemption is on tv you dont turn it off no one does because that is an example of a great movie if i never hear about this movie again that is all that will salvage it in my mind some of the visuals were nice but that is about it they werent great it was few and far between and honestly i dont know how you can even try to bank on the visuals because it was basically like any other space movie there was nothing that set it apart in my mind i couldnt even consider being impressed by any aspect of this movie it should be put on a shelf and forgotten christopher nolan should go back to making batman moviesnegative,i thought the film was totally awful bad script bad acting bad music and especially bad taste it pretends to mock james bond but with no style whatsoever they are using young people to tell a story that has no moral and is totally unrealistic it seems like a celebration of violence with countless bloody scenes that make you sick they are not offering any interesting points of view but telling a cheap story through violence sexism and clichs including a blond princess i dont see why anyone would want to watch this film and i dont recommend it to anyone i also feel pretty bad about the cast who have supported such a bad film even worst on them they should have never accepted this filmnegative,i thought the film was totally awful bad script bad acting bad music and especially bad taste it pretends to mock james bond but with no style whatsoever

even though its maybe  at best  a 4 because this is definitely not worth 8 guardians of the galaxy was a shot i chose to try in god knows how long since ive been to the cinema this is just another load of hollywood trash i had the impression it was innovative considering the guardians being pulled out from the bottom of the pile and the whole outlaw thing but i was wrong in the beginning whatshisname is on earth and it is apparently 88 the kids mother dies ok is this meant to be emotional despite the fact i have no attachment to any of these characters yet? oh wow its the future now im sorry his mother dies he goes outside and then he gets abducted? what is this supposed to signify? not to mention its obviously unbelievably and strangely timed but this is probably an attempt at giving some depth to the main character but really doesnt do anything for the major plot of the entire film the rest of the film was just a bunch of underdogs coming together because they end up in the same space prison because what happens when youre arrested together is you share a block not to mention gender is no issue here then they fall into this orb situation what is it? it it is this orb and it is powerful a bit like the cube or something there was little development in the story at all really a few changes in direction but no real twists or anything surprising i dont even know i was almost asleep half the time i was constantly checking my watch to see when it was over so we have hideous cgi here ridiculously unprofessional but i guess im not in with the cgi in blockbusters they have this obnoxious claim to fame with technology it seems having the ability to do these things doesnt make it cool it just looks like a video game another thing visually was the designs it was just so typical of the actionscifi genre in the technology and whatnot and the characters very much in the same boat but moreso thrown together effortlessly then after that its all explosions  speeding  advertising  hitting in between theres a conceited amount of one liners that made me cringe the best kind and in the end we have some false suspense because we know everything is going to be okay overall >the comedy was horrid >the story was simple >the characters were lacking in everything really the cinematography didnt even involve cameras >the soundtrack was a bunch of pop classics chucked together so what was good about it? the action1111 wait no >the action was too much unnecessary and clearly there to fill in time main reason i even saw this was i received an invitation from some mates i think ill try go back to sticking to films with a point the only point of this was to brainwash and make big bucksnegative,i thought it was a complete waste of time to go to the cinema to watch this movie where to start? the plot is ridiculous the script is simple and not genuine the characters are weak and afflecks acting is terrible it seems like they try too hard to make the impression the story is complex but this worsens it even more in general this movie makes you feel nothingis not believable and i really dont know how can someone launch a movie like this and not feel any shame i respect this director very much but this work is not at all close to what he has done before i have to say it is one of the worst movies i have ever seennegative,i think back to this movie and have no feeling for italthough i remember all of the scenesthere is no emotion or empathy that i feelit was three hours of watching nothingnessin my opinion i could have been watching my or my friends life storiesbut ours are probably more exciting than this ludicrous film it was apparently filmed over twelve years why? they could have hired different actors as time went by and made this movie in a few monthsi dont see it as artistic or unique in any waya young boy grows uplike all of us in different ways there are various issuesdivorced parentsbeing bullied in high schooletc so what? i compare this film to a fascinating british series called the seven up series a small group of british childrenaged sevenfrom various backgrounds and classes were interviewed every seven yearsuntil aged fifty sixthey were followednot all of them continued to participate later on but most of them didit was amazing to see what had happened to them in comparison to what their initial thoughts were when they were seven years oldi loved that seriesit was cleverinterestingunique and i couldnt wait to see what had happened to these kidsin boyhoodby comparisoni couldnt care at all what happens to masonhis sisterhis mom played by patricia arquette or his dadethan hawki was left with an empty feeling why did i waste three hours watching this boring film which masquerades as art? pleasedont let it win best picture at the golden globes oroscar awards i will be completely turned off hollywood movies dont waste your money on this drivelwatch it for free when its on tv if you are really curiousnegative,i saw the trailer expecting this to be an extraordinary movie angelina jolies looks is perfect for the part the effects promised to be nothing short of awesome and the glimpse at the dragon woke up delightful memories of fear from the day i saw the original cartoon movie with my mom a long time ago i bought the tickets to see it in 3d with my daughters and i could anticipate the atmosphere of malevolence from the dark maleficent then it all changed in the name of doing something different and to surprise the audience the screenplay writers threw a wonderfully balanced story out the window and decided to make a nonsensical parody instead who do they think they are? to second guess writers that have thrilled whole generations of people and produce this garbage in the name of the box office? not only did they alter the essence of the story but they made a total confusion out of the message of good versus evil what? bad is good and good is bad? or is it good sometimes and bad in others? what will the kids think? do the screenplay writers really expect that the kids will readily understand how despair and betrayal can turn someone into a vengeful person? does it even have a place in this story? of course not kids may need to be taught reality in real life but when they are told a story taking place in an imaginary world they expect something straightforward so that a message stands clearly out the only good thing that can come out of this is that someone somewhere makes a remix of this movie the way it should be done filling the blanks with the original cartoon masterpiece shame on you disney studios watch snow white and the hunter and learn how a classic story should be told and especially how far it can be altered without losing its essencenegative,i saw the trailer and the science of interstellar on youtube and i felt compelled to watch the movie oh boy the movie was such a disappointment there no respect for science in interstellar the movie is a waste of time and money it was without logic and too long i dont understand how such an awful movie can have 910 stars its beyond my comprehension the music is to loud and for nothing there is no real tension after reading the 1010 reviews i felt compelled to register an account on imdb to say how awful the movie was stay way please or youll regret it from now on i will never rely on imdb reviews when it comes to decide what to watch imdb you disappointed menegative,i saw the rating of 83 at the imdb and wanted to watch the movie the movie started well but then it moved into the same lame side of the universethe movie brings nothing new to us it was like watching avengers againor any other superhero movie where the superheroes fight with each other at the beginning but then unite to fight a common enemy the movie was packed with inappropriate and lame humour the acting was below average marvels should really consider the type of movies that they r making i am still shocked that how on earth that this movie got an 83 ratings this surely effects the credibility of imdbnegative,i saw all the positive reviews for maleficent so i went to watch it in the cinemas with high hopes i wish i had ignored the reviews maybe i went in with too great an expectation but ive marked and graded 8th grade creative writing papers with more substance and plot when you can call the conflict and resolution as soon as it is being set up you know more thought was put into the cgi than actual story development and the casting oh god the only person who was logically cast was jolie dont even get me started on the child actors there were many times where i turned and looked at everyone else watching to see if they were reacting positively to what was on screen i found a couple breaking out the cards and playing a game of bluff the ending quote and fade to black was met with a what the f was that? by the audience and a bunch of laughing and booing if you require more than pretty colours to entertain you save your money and time for any other film maleficent gets a star for its beautiful cgi work and costume design but falls flat in every other respectnegative,i remember seeing this movie in the theater after that i saw it at least once on vhs maybe twice i picked up the bluray of this used from a blockbuster that was closing ive been more interested in seeing spyaction movies recently and it seemed like something i should revisit i wish i hadnt bought it there are so many problems with this movie nearly all of which have to do with the script first i dont care about anyone on the team cruise doesnt come across as having a personality and he doesnt behave like a skilled agent everyone else in the cast seems to be disposable second the plot had potential to be an interesting story provided that the story was treated a little more like the ateam with them trying to prove their innocence instead we wind up with a story where we arent positive why cruise is doing anything except for some vague idea and it comes across confusing because its hard to draw a line between his actions and his goal third because of the first two i find myself having no sense of tension or investment in the outcome of the movie i couldnt care less if cruise lives or dies the movie hasnt aged well the pacing is strange and once again computers are relegated to be magic boxes and the action sequences seem to be silly when cruise leaps from the exploding fish tank i couldnt keep from laughing the big finish fight with the train and the helicopter was not up to the same level of silliness but it was very very close now i have to figure out what to do with this bluray copy that i really will never look at againnegative,i rely on imdb when it comes to decide what to watch and what not to watch rating of 92 looks so attractive that i didnt even bother to check the trailer i went to watch the movie with very high expectations but was very disappointed as i was watching it i was thinking maybe know it will start to make sense but it didnt even by the last scene it was a total bollywood drama where hero doesnt die no matter where he is the most funny part was when he press the eject button in space it does has some big star cast but the base story line crumbles beyond imagination it was like monkeys had written the script as they has shown in south park awful movie total waste of time and money please go if you hate yourself or your life which is one and the same thingnegative,i really wanted to like this film i was looking forward to watching it after reading the rave reviews and seeing the trailer now having seen it what an awful movie _ although the film starts out promisingly enough except for the heartstringstugging opening in the hospital it rapidly becomes the same old shoot em up that you have seen innumerable times the special effects are good but the fightbattle scenes are too frenetic to be able to follow the action clearly i also found the plot torturous and difficult to follow due to the proliferation of double crosses unclear explanation of who the bad guys are and then the bad guys behind the bad guys confusion with all the different places empires etc and their interrelationships some of the dialogue was execrable with chris pratt talking like a dude from 2014 ironic considering he was abducted by aliens decades agonegative,i really wanted to like this film i was looking forward to watching it after reading the rave reviews and seeing the trailer now having seen it what an awful

positive points on the whole it was stunningly underwhelming dont waste your money on this stinkeroo parents note this is not the movie you want to take your children to see it is one of the most graphically violent movies i can ever remember seeing comic decapitations are still decapitations there is also a scene where a mother tries to murder her innocent toddler with a large ax one of the characters is literally cut in half from top to bottom and then shown in graphic detail awkwardly stapled back together a large part of these problems can be directly related to inept direction director matthew vaughn has no ability to reign in the more hammish actors samuel l jackson pulls out all the stops  and basically ruins every scene he is in jacksons performance has to be the worst of his long career it may well be one of the worst performances of the decade his character was just stupid and incredibly offensive to so many people on so many different levels he chose to speak with a cartoonish lisp which might suggest he is effeminate or perhaps that he has a speech impediment  motivation is not an issue here  dont look for logic or rationality anywhere in this awkward movie fans of colin firth jack davenport mark hamill and michael caine will be very very disturbed by how these characters are treated on a positive note taron egerton is a delight he has enough skills to overcome the horrible direction and ham handed performancesnegative,i really like the series with peter grave 171 episodes between 1966 and 1973 and 35 episodes between 1988 and 1990 who shows jim phelps and his team saving the good against the bad and make of the character of jim phelps a traitor was too much for me it was simply disrespectful for all person who knows the 2 series it was better to kill the character in mission than make him an traitor now if i forget the series my vote will be an 6 the train under the channel was really too much an helicopter behind a train in a tunnel the explosion of this helicopter who only punch tom cruise back on the train the rest of the movie was better i like the scene with the explosion of the aquarium sorry for my english but my mothertongue is frenchnegative,i really like nolan and like all of its films until i saw interstellar the movie has its moments but in between those moments there is lot of time waste this is one movie that i really wanted to see but in between the movie i was thinking when is this going to get over i think nolan could not decide between making a scifi movie and an emotional movie he has given an average movie and because its a nolan movie i have given it a 1star i know it doesnt really deserve 1star but then i am angry with imdb there is no way it should be rated 9 i think lately imdb has become a hub where marketing people raise the rating through any means available disappointed in nolan and imdb too negative,i really dont see how everyone is giving such great reviews of this movie its one giant plot hole from which no stars can escape say what you like about nolans film making style but this movie should have never been made throughout the overly long self indulgent piece of crap i said many times that this movie had better end really well of course its just one notch above the worst ending i can think of for it i think they killed all the consultants off before they started filming too just save yourselves run dont watch itnegative,i really cant enjoy a clich_ like this one and i dont understand how people can get behind an awful childish movie like guardians of the galaxy cheap jokes and laughs seen that done that scenes bad guys and visual effects i didnt care much for any of the characters in the movie and the powerful connection between the members of the team had to be the most important part of it nobody was funny there werent any cool jokes and creative and visually stunning scenes it was just another scifi ripoff from the major productions in the genre huge disappointment dont watch it 85??? people are weird not the movienegative,i really cant enjoy a clich like this one and i dont understand how people can get behind an awful childish movie

should be a must see ones and this one fails big time in the must see list if you are for a mindless action movie with some bond lines from the 80s yes this is something that you will enjoy if however you want to see something enjoyable with nice humor and an actual interesting plot then please dont watch this one youll definitely waste your time what you get here is something that you know the end in the first 5 minutes i mean come on the struggle to be accepted in the high society and the movies about it was a hit 30 years ago if you have money or you are a clever person then you will be welcomed everywhere in the world also the jokes are flat and you have to be 15 years old to actually laugh all in all you get a lousy plot with lousy lines and a soso action with some cgi effects thanks but no thanksnegative,i read some opinions from different users before watching the movie and even got excited about the idea of paying my entrance for guardians of the galaxy but was absolutely disappointed because what i found was once again as many major blockbusters do a weak plot and lots of action scenes without an strong story behind and when a movie lacks an story it feels like an amount of nonsense battles and a compendium of action heroes against bad guys i really like the characters of the film but the quality of a movie cannot rely on the strenght of undeveloped characters star wars is still ligth years ahead from these guardians sorry waste of money and timenegative,i never write reviews about movies but having seen the ratings on this site i have to say something to stop people from being misled about this so called blockbuster the movie is total rubbish and made no sense the acting is dreadful and watching it after an hour made me wish everyone died so i could end my pain 3 hours of my life that i will never get back do not waste your time watching this movie and if you do just remember i warned you first ps i have also noticed that all the 1010 reviews are from many non english speaking countries and just i wonder if they have all been paid to boost the ratings of this publicity driven awful movie stay clearnegative,i must say that i really didnt like this film all that much though since i had seen the first i felt that maybe i should go and see the second one though i am having second thoughts as to whether i will go and see any more basically the film follows on from the first film where the divergents have fled the city and are now hiding out with one of the factions that lives out in the country however this what were it was a little confusing at the end of the first film i thought they have fled behind the wall however it turns out that they hadnt but instead were hiding out in one of the rural areas secondly i though much of the city had been rebuilt and from what i can remember of the first film chicago was nowhere near as ruined as it was in this film basically the villain comes across this box hidden in one of the ruins and realises that she must find a divergent to be able to open it so she sends out her guards namely the members of dauntless who remained loyal to her to track them all down as it turns out trix is the one divergent that is able to open the box however the problem is that she is in hiding as are all the other divergents however that is all i really feel that i can say about this film i thought it was boring the acting was pretty ordinary and i ended up sitting in my seat for the two hours that the film went for quite uncomfortable and waiting for it to end it seemed that i enjoyed the first film and obviously there will be a conclusion but a part of me simply wants to read the wikipedia entry for the book so i dont have to spend anytime sitting around the cinema watching it when i could be doing something else i hope they dont go and do what they did with the hunger games and split the final book into two movies but we will see when they get around to releasing itnegative,i must echo the sentiments of many of the other negative reviewers the movie moved into emotional elements of the characters without developing the characters i felt nothing for the characters and i really wanted to there were a few moments when i was interested enough to see how the makers were going to present some of the physics based elements but nobodynothing got spaghettafied neil degrasse tysons descriptionterm it is really a love story disguised as a scifi fantasy and not even a very good love story i was so bored i fell asleep for about 15 minutes i felt like just getting up and leaving so many times but i thought maybe if i stayed it would get better it didnt i really hoped that the actors starring in the movie could make it better they tried but it didnt help can i get my money back? how many millions of people could they have fed for the money they wasted making this movie? they could make it up to me if they donated the money they made from this movie to feed the poor in this countrynegative,i may drop a few spoilers here so be warned i find it very hard to understand why so many people thought this movie was so good yes there was a good cast yes the special effects were good in this day and age that is expected but the story? teaching that space travel to the moon was a hoax? whats that about? the farmer just happens to be a trained astronaut? his daughter just happens to be a mathematical genius? the lies that are told and this intelligent astronaut is so gullible? the denigration of education as if that is any positive way to save mankind? the striving by the government to have more farmers when it has been obvious since the industrial revolution that larger mechanized farms utilizing fewer farmers are more productive the belief that new colonies can be created by bringing embryos to life? who thought this up? the same people who strive for an uneducated populace? and amid all this somehow commuter space travel is developed? too much bull for me to swallow really folks?????negative,i may be too harsh giving guardians of the galaxy such a poor rating but i have to be honest this movie is garbage i suspect that the people who give it such high praises are nothing but marvel fanboys gotg is boring really really boring the movie tries to be funny but falls flat with one bad joke after another rocket raccoon who is obviously supposed to be the funniest character since he is the most sarcastic and has the most oneliners is painfully unfunny anyway i laughed a little bit at the beginning the rest of the time i stared blankly at the screen periodically glancing at my watch the action sequences only contributed to the boringness of the movie why? theres no risk to the main characters it is obvious that they wont be killed the danger is never convincing enough to raise the pulse guardians of the galaxy is a bad movienegative,i love scifi thrillers and all i hated this one there is something fundamentally wrong with this movie the story reads as an excuse an excuse to keep you in a room and play some space flight scenes the film tried so much that ended up failing in everything i think the problem is the blend of emotional crap with bandaid surrealistic physics that makes no sense just so that emotion could be the focus of this crap movie i would really like to convey my opinion but this movie only left 2 brain cells properly working it is that bad i sincerely hope i make it i have been drooling ever since i left the cinemanegative,i love scifi and so hoped that this movie would be great given the reviews but it is literally one of the worst movies i have ever seen do not waste your time or money there are no emotional or intellectual catalysts behind this worse than b movie film who gives a damn about such stupid undeveloped characters? i am groot this is the best line of the film and groot a living tree is the best character enough said? if you like stupid campy scifi films smoke some dope and maybe youll like this one if you want to listen to 1970s pop music get a cassette tape such a disappointment wasted 2 hours of my lifenegative,i love marvel whether it be xmen thor the avengers spiderman iron man most of the commonly known ones of course but i always loved them but to put this as simply as i can though that doesnt mean this will be short this film was filled with 1000 of the most common clichs extracted from these great films and stories and crammed them into one mashedup jumpy unreserved ridiculous abnormal spiteful detestable idiotic moronic absurd ludicrous senseless meaningless pointless terriblywritten unbelievably unrealistic supersupersuperherowannabe movie that very desperately and obviously and obnoxiously attempts to specialeffect everything and i mean everything to simply gain some big bucks because hey its marvel what could go wrong? its sad to see how successful their attempts were i fell for it for me its all due to the avengers because that was freaking amazing even though it had a lot of commonplace stuff and boy do i regret wasting my two hours on this extremely disappointing collage basically its a film made of collages because everything just had to be colorful in outer space no seriously of course everything is colorful there its not like the galaxy is filled with 96% dark matter that is called dark for a reason so yeah totally makes sense and your skin also starts rotting in outerspace too serious case of leprosy then? i liked elektra more than this id rather have watched that five times kind of feel like that says something the only reasons i smiled or laughed was because the directors and script writers were decent at making corny jokes puns and lines funny enough that giggling is impossible prevent unless you are emotionless they should have gone with comedy rather than actionadventure though since i sincerely thought the rest of the moments were just junk call me a spoilsport if you must but i was literally whispering what would happen in the next minute to my friend beside me usually im not very good at predicting what happens in films unless they are seriously full of clichswhich this film is but i said them anyway i was right 8 times out of 9 i counted anyway though the beautiful graphics did rival that of avatar the plot of saving the people from the evil mastermind only this time it involves the whole galaxy instead of just one planet so its not just earth thats being targeted this time so ha we are different never got this tiring i was so close to sinking in my chair and dreaming up a nightmare because of how stupidly predictable this film was maybe that was intentional and marvel fans just wanted to see some new more unique heroes this time and also to see the visuals and maybe to see chris pratt and zoe saldanas pretty buttsbut whatever i had half that mind prepared for a clichturned awesome movie when i walked in the theater i came out with my whole mind filling up and overloading with shame and displeasure so plot would have been old and good but it wasnt protagonists i would have cared for them more if the filmmakers didnt blow up almost everyones favorite guy and kept alive some peoples leastliked guys so yeah villains  oh my gosh no seriously? what even happened to the evil robot woman? did the filmmakers just completely forget her? music louder than inceptions horn and i loved that even though it had no tune couldnt stand this though but still be ready for some rocking 80s and 90s music that i would have downloaded if they didnt play those songs during totally inappropriate moments comedy relief my butt the only relief i got out of the soundtrack that isnt even their soundtrack hopefully they didnt violate any copy rights i mean if its these filmmakers i wouldnt be surprised is that im glad groot enjoyed himself visuals stunning that wasnt sarcastic at all at all what else? oh yeah unless you pay me a million dollars i would never watch the sequel so sorry i cant contribute ten dollars for marvel next time tough luck dont let this review stop you though most of my friends liked it and of course most people who reviewed this movie liked it so i guess im just a jerk im betting you readers agree and thats totally understandable since i am totally venting but hey three out of four of my friends never watched a marvel movie so call me bluffing but i sincerely experienced one of the deepest disappointments i have ever dealt with in regards to a movie franchise in my entire life  im still going to watch xmen though dang you marvelnegative,i love marvel whether it be xmen thor the avengers spiderman iron man most of the commonly known ones of course but i always loved them but to

ever dealt with in regards to a movie franchise in my entire life  im still going to watch xmen though dang you marvelnegative,i love good superhero films captain america superman iron man this is not one of them if id been alone i would have walked out and the last time i did that in a cinema was for the wedding singer its not without merit but with $170 million spent i would hope not the design overall is very good the effects also and unlike some i liked chris pratt and the ronan actor but the attempted humour in the dialog is supremely irritating and the racoon characters grating voice was enough on its own to make me hate the talking scenes the film is so derivative it could have been assembled by cut and paste but at least it does not take itself seriously we are thankful for small mercies enough said i will go out of my way to avoid james gunn films in futurenegative,i love dramatic movies i love scifi movies i love most of christopher nolans work i was so excited to see interstellar after all the 1010 reviews but after seeing it i was thoroughly disappointed my actual rating is probably 610 i rated 110 to balance the other ratings spoilers ahead here are my major problems with this movie 1over dramatized effects throughout 2every character except for 3 of them was just a redshirt with no characterization just created to be killed off 3the science aspect was stupid especially in the second half 4did this highly developed 5d race have any way to save humans besides creating a room that a guy would go to to tell himself to go there so that he could send binary through a watch to his daughter that is older than he is? 5the ending was a thorough disappointment everything was happy dandy and the whole human race was saved just because of data from a black hole? they never explain why that data is even useful 6poorly designed and explained apocalypse earth didnt seem to be in much peril 7okay when mann blew the airlock couldnt the others just tell him that it would blow up half the ship instead of saying dont do it its not the right decision 8really? the voice of corruption is called mann? that was a stupid metaphor 9i dont think there was even enough water on millers planet to make waves those big seeing as it wasnt even knee deep 10just wasnt what it was cracked up to be the film was heavily lacking in character development and plot the science aspect was unbelievable and stupid parts that i liked no it didnt all suck 1tarz was pretty cool he was unique compared to all other robots from scifi movies ive seen 2the highly dramatized parts would have been good in moderation and there were some good special effects 3i didnt fall asleep which is good i just cant believe so many people are raving over this movie its like theyre too dumb to see past special effects and blaring music to see that the movie itself wasnt any good people try to tell me the science in this movie couldve made sense because its not discovered yet i think a planet with alien dinosaurs who speak english would have been more believable its worth seeing so you can realize how wrong everyone is but dont expect too muchnegative,i looked forward to seeing this film so i was excited today i watched it it started badly i couldnt understand what the characters were mumbling later on i found this a god send it awful a real mess  badly made most of the time i had no idea what was going on too many characters introduced so quickly six different locations in ten minutes i hate itill never watch it again i only watched it to see if would improve but no it got worseif the comic was like this well its no wonder i have never heard of them beforethe tiny bits of humor are the only things that made em pay attention to anythingi wouldnt recommend this to anybodynegative,i just recently watched the series from beginning to the present episodes such promise the show has slowly deteriorated into a scifi soap opera to oliver thea is not really your sister shes your half sister from a man your mother had an affair with whom she now hates or hated because she is now dead or is she? that man is dead now or was dead and is now training your half sister to be a killer why did she stop hating him? oh and the love of her life roy is being replaced by a dj olivers main concern is bedding every female in the cast while those around him slowly find out who he really is the whole show reminds me of the heroes series because it seems that week to week they dont know where the story is going so they change things at the drop of a hat and hope people go along with itnegative,i just finished watching this movie and have to say what the heck is wrong with hollywood? do they not have writers that any frigging common sense how hard is it to make a movie that is logical engaging and doesnt insult your intelligence you could try and suspend rational thought and just try to watch it for entertainment but thats impossible to do in this movie because there is no suspense no serious action frankly its pretty boring the premise completely defies logic first there is no way the government would not have been all over the notsosecret unguarded facility really depp was supposed to be a super intelligence why would he set up in an unguarded section in the us? depp is supposed to be in the internet with access to any file but he couldnt find out about the governmentterrorist plot? the script screws itself up depp rewrote his code so it was totally unbelievable that a virus could have been created in a few minutes stupid the whole premise of the movie was stupid technology is bad and any advancements must be destroyed this concept was so stupid depp  s character was curing people the environment there was nothing evil about what he was doing the writing was terrible the reason the terrorists wanted to destroy depp  s creation is stupid it makes no sense there was no build up of depp  s character going from good to evil the lawn mower man did a way better job of showing how the characters went from nice to homicidal maniac it was just plain stupid to set the premise that depp had become the smartest super computer but he acted like he had the iq of a 2 year old dont waste your time on this unintelligent movienegative,i just an advanced screening of this movie and felt i had to write about it i expected so much from this director wally pfister and cast and i just feel so let down it seems this movie is meant to be a pure scifi with a great message at its heart but it just wasnt good points it has a great cast it looks great good cinematography the cgi was a good standard but not mind blowing bad points major plot holesits also very dull i can usually take the mrs into a scifi movie and although she wont enjoy it on the same level i would she would be able to sit through it good thing i watched it on my own as she would not be able to stomach this in fact i was seriously bored there are no sub plots there are no twists and turns in fact not much happened ********* this part of the review contains major spoilers ***************** there is no real explanation of how they upload the mind of the main scientist  other than some reference to a monkey brain that another scientist managed to achieve then there is the whole building of an entire datacentre  the one the size of a small city underground by a contractor who seems to only have experience in building cafes and houses why does the government not notice that an entire town has been taken over? once the nanites are everywhere why not just infect the whole world? why does the ai not just suicide itself instead of allowing itself to be infected? then there is the idea that max writes a virus to destroy the ai that was created  exactly how does this man out wit the greatest intelligence in the history of the world? how does max infect evelyn? just because max works in ai how does that mean he could write this amazing virus into a human being? ok maybe i am a little biased i have a degree in computer science and i work as full time software developer so maybe i know a bit too much but still **** end of spoilers ****** the entire movie felt flat on its face it invoked no emotion whatsoever there was no wow moment there was no edge of your seat thriller it was a dull scifi movie with a big budget and a great cast i love scifi and thrillers and i am a huge chris nolan fan so i had high hopes for this also please mr pfister go back to doing cinematography with chris nolannegative,i heard a lot of squealing about this movie and expected better but its very conventional and follows the same ol story arc as movies it is supposedly mocking the characters are a tad snide and make a few quips but other than that this movie is extremely middleofthe road the only lead character with any screen presence was the big wrestler guy as for the lead if that dude walked by me on the street i totally would not recognize him no star power here no screen presence zoe saldana is starting to get typecast as space babe she should take another kind of role soon bradley coopers character was downright annoying an angry little animated character is not new or groundbreaking we dont even get a dynamic bad guy people everyone knows that if you want your movie to be kickass you have to make your bad guy dynamic weirdly sexyor at the very least british this is known as the alan rickman principle this bad guy was just some weird blue dude who apparently drooled a lot while eating black licorice and forgot to wipe his mouth off this movie is a giant hohumnegative,i have seen birdemic birdemic 2 the room sharknado and etcetera but none of them come remotely close to this terrible film the aforementioned are at least comical in their terribleness boyhood is neither funny nor inspiring or anything positive for that matter halfway through the film i felt myself wishing that ellar coltrane had died in a tragic car accident or something of the sort just to prevent this film from ever being produced the concept for the film is splendid and one of a kind unfortunately nothing else was remotely interesting please save yourself 3 hours and do something else eat some dirt lick a bee smack your arm with a sledgehammer repeatedly for 2 and a half hours to give yourself half an hour to spare anything and i mean anything is better than this filmnegative,i have not read the book but will now just in the hope of finding something that justifies the hype around this story the film was like a farce which to me verged on the comical with the cartoonesque type characters another reviewer comments that had this been billed as a dark comedy it might have just cut the mustard and with that i agree but a tense psychological thriller? no way it was not cleverly written there were plot holes galore the diary really bugged meeven after slight burning i think they could have told that it had been recently writtenand the whole of amys escape story was just utter hogwash the acting was abysmal with the exception of carrie coon margowho presented the only sympathetic and remotely realistic character in the whole thing not my cup of tea at allnegative,i have no idea where are all these amazing reviews are coming from i fell from them and watched the first episode which is totally crap its a poorly made soap  with long stares and bad acting the characters are fake and the plot is a total rip off my best guess is that the writers of these reviews are the actors their family and friends who are posting fake reviews do not watch this show  i want my wasted time back i have no idea where are all these amazing reviews are coming from i fell from them and watched the first episode which is totally crap its a poorly made soap  with long stares and bad acting the characters are fake and the plot is a total rip off my best guess is that the writers of these reviews are the actors their family and friends who are posting fake reviews do not watch this show  i want my wasted time backnegative,i have never wrote a review in my life ever but i feel compelled to do so for this film im utterly shocked just shocked this movie has an 84 rating what on earth are people thinking? seriously? i could go on and on about how the plot is a complete joke but ill just point out the most obvious of all that totally shatters any believably that this film ever had okay amy said desi came to her house and kidnapped her that morning huh? she had no clue what he was really doing that morning none what if he had a meeting with ten other people that could account for him not being at her house? what if he was having breakfast with someone that morning? ok next now how about the diary? so did desi kidnap her then grab the diary and bring it to a house he had no clue even existed and burn only about 20% of it? next when she pretends to be screaming with blood on her dress against the window so the surveillance cameras would see her seriously? what about all the other footage those cameras captured? for example her and desi sitting together on a couch watching tv oh she deleted that footage? well what the hell is her explanation for all the footage being erased except the 20 seconds of her screaming this is not me nitpicking the film and looking super hard to try and find problems i get it a lot of movies have plot holes here and there and im okay with that but people these are huuuuge holes in the story plot holes are in tons of movies all the time but not usually a major motion picture with a major director and a major movie star and please dont tell me shes nuts and thats why she didnt cover her tracks worth a damn i am talking about the fact that she gets away with it to all the law enforcement this belongs on lifetime those movies you can just shrug off what baffles me and actually really upsets me is the fact it has a rating of 84 so please people help me understand this what on earth gives this such a high rating? what were people thinking? what?negative,i have actually watched just about all of the show that has been released i am not writing my review after watching ten minutes of the pilot and deciding its crap i really kind of liked the idea behind this show i heard some people complaining about the lack of realism but come on its a superhero show a little unrealism ought to be allowed upon watching the first few episodes i kinda hoped that like lots of great television shows the actors and writers just needed a bit of time to get into their groove really find their characters once that occurred i reasoned the quality of the show would start to pick up so despite my initial reservations i kept watching and waiting and waiting and waiting it just never happened the plot has remained unimaginative static and predictable the actors are wooden and unsympathetic and the writing is overall just a train wreck i could honestly predict exactly what the actors were going to say next it pains me to see this truly mediocreatbest show get the rating it has received i will attribute this injustice to the fact that the actors are incredibly pretty and the assumption that those giving this show a good rating would have their brains explode upon watching some quality programmingnegative,i hated this movie its not just a truly horrible film its so incredibly ultra violent its like the video game grand theft auto with zombies only worse this was the most disgusting type of violence gratuitous and glorified truly over the top the trailer for this movie is 100 % misleading it makes it look like a james bond movie in reality its more like a zombie movie horrible horrible horrible i wish i could unbuy this movie ticket i wish i could unsee this movie its truly the worst movie ive ever seen absolutely disgusting i gave this movie 1 star but if i could i would give it a minus 10 i feel sick to my stomach most definitelynegative,i hated the movie because the end is creepy and weird that she kisses her on the bed while shes dead and then she wakes because it was true love kiss makes me think that she wants to say that there is no true love at all between women and men and that true love only lies between women and women that is kind of gay and pathetic and sick i am very disappointed in the movie  maybe the next movie for disney would be about a love story between two lesbians hows that ? prince phillip used to be my favorite disney prince but here i guess hes just another tool used by feminists to shove their message down our throatsnegative,i had my doubts before but now i am sure if it disney has sold out recently disney has been releasing films that whether the public chooses to acknowledge it or not have been paintbynumbers at best films like the lone ranger thor the dark world and frozen yes frozen its the same disney crap youve seen over and over people dont get me wrong i love disney but not this disney one that would butcher one of its own beloved fairy tales to make a quick buck yes you heard right disney did stoop that low i should have known that this film would be garbage from the getgo when they hired alice in wonderland writer melissa woolverton to pen the screenplay and alice in wonderland production designer robert stromberg to direct are you sensing a pattern here? lets touch on that for a moment the mouse house in its infinite wisdom got a production designervfx supervisor who had never directed anything to direct their $200 million blockbuster as a result maleficents beautiful visuals carry no weight and the actors for the most part seem utterly lost because what the hell would a set designer know about directing actors? even angelina jolie cant pull off her real emotional scenes because she is left to direct herself what really sank this movie for me was disney blatantly ripping themselves off and using the true love twist from frozen literally the exact same twist i have no problem with disney creating a strong independent heroine but if youre going to do that dont have your heroine wear a skintight leather black cat suit in the climax of your movie in short disney has definitely lost its magic and its going to be tough to get it back dont listen to the positive reviews remember how glowing alice in wonderlands were when it first came out? you have been warnednegative,i had high hopes for this film i am sorry to say interstellar was the worst film i have seen in a long time i have seen many terrible films but none have compelled me to ever write a review of what i thought there is too many things that make this film and i am not going to rant along here i just wanted to say if i could rate this film 01 out of 10 i would plot holes complete disregard for science bad acting better special effects and spacecraft motion physics have been seen in thunderbird puppets storyline has no clue where it is going and many more i would put this film in childrens fantasy category rather than science fictionnegative,i had heard quite a bit for mission impossible especially now that the third one is about to come out in the theaters i knew my parents owned the first mission impossible but due to the crazy antics tom cruise has pulled on well basically everyone he has pretty much turned me off of his movies but i figured to give the mission impossible movies a shot while over all this is an exciting actionspy flicks there were only a few scenes in the movie i felt were worth the watch obviously the exciting scene of tom coming through the ceiling on wires and copying the information onto disk the last action sequence of the helicopter and train with ethan and our surprise villain very well thought out unrealistic but exciting to watch over all for movies sake give mission impossible a chance but its nothing i would scream or jump on couches about  410negative,i got something out of this movie i really did it was 35 degrees celsius outside the cinema and all i needed was a three hour nap in cool airconditioning lucky me the latest nolan film just there for the taking it started off as i hoped it would all dusty on the porch of some ranch in the middle of the us otherwise known as nowhere the end of the world syrupy americanstyle little kid tugging at the heart strings  my eyelids already beginning to droop even before coop and his daughter murph wind up at some place that some old cockney and his very jewish daughter inhabit guess it only happens in movies with a blind casting director but that was fine i was almost in rem sleep  not having been able to process a word of dialogue from mcconaughey in over 20 minutes pure bliss and it got even better from an insomniacs point of view thanks to an absurd plot and woefully unimaginative cgi effects my chin was almost on my chest when they landed on the first planet the other side of well lets just call it credulity i dont sleep this well at home wait were going through another kubrickstyle time dimension  didnt we just spend half an hour on this planet reusing some special effects this time made to look like giant waves left over from inception? i think so but time warps so nicely when youre practically snoring i think we lost an astronaut somewhere maybe thats the game whos next? i hope its the astrophysicist who explains wormholes with a moebius strip he forgets to twist either that or it was origami for dummies maybe that *was* the guy we just lost  hard to tell they all act the same flat as the dialogue thanks guys anyway we can only pray it will be hathaway soon shes starting to keep me awake how can a head bob about so much in weightlessness? but im being unfair i think i remember her trying to act some of this script brave move from an oscar winner im starting to want my money back anyway im roused a bit now and thus a bit grumpy were in another galaxys version of antarctica minus the faintest signs of life  this despite because of? the unzipping of a new bad actor fortunately this actor goes even beyond his usual leaden deadness and im soon starting to lose consciousness again and time travel merrily back to the land of nod i think there was a plot twist involved because this astronaut is trying to do a dave and hal routine he must think hes in a good movie poor sod did i mention there must have been yards of inception on the cuttingroom floor last time because im watching more and more outtakes? gotta save a few million here and there i had a dream i dreamed that nolan would come up with a slew of insanely bizarre plot twists right at the end that would explain the entire reason for watching this flick but they carried me out on a stretcher before i found out if it was true apparently i was having a nightmare screaming morse code no no no not morse code thats spielberg at the top of my lungs and disturbing the other patrons naps i was obviously paying too much attention even comatosenegative,i got pulled in at the start it turned out like any other mystery action movie all the clues and other attributes etc but there was so many thing that just are so idiotic that it pisses me off i have had so much tension on this from the book thinking it will be amazing but it all went away half way through the movie spoilers the part when she actually tries to make up the part of rape and when she puts wine on her skirt and whatever was so stupid what about the bloody cameras you idiots and if youre going to say she disabled them the what about the actual fake rape scene she sucked his dick and was wearing lingerie for gods sake who wears lingerie randomly if they looked at the cameras to watch the rape then what about the dick sucking and shirt tearing and pulling him in on you then pulling a knife out from under the pillow but what finished it for me was the ending what man like him in their own mind would stay with a murdering bitch like that and still love her this was my opinion you dont have to agree but i just found it so stupidnegative,i get the hype really linklaters before trilogy was fantastic i especially loved before midnight and people were justified in expecting great things from boyhood what i dont get are the numerous and nearly uniformly raving reviews this film has been getting from the critics and everyone else im utterly baffled by this critics are using words like masterpiece monumental profound and so on to describe this movie the film is currently sitting at #58 on imdbs top 250 all this praise is making me feel like a crazy person because i felt boyhood absolutely didnt deliver on the hype in fact the movie cant even be described as mediocre i feel like i need to make on thing clear here just because boyhood had the novel idea of shooting a film with the same actors during a long period of time doesnt grant it any automatic points a novel idea or approach may pique my interest and convince me to see a movie but thats as far as it goes we dont appreciate and enjoy movies simply because someone put some effort into them there has to actually be something there to justify spending our precious time and money to watch pixels on a screen for a couple of hours now lets jump into my gripes with the movie firstly boyhood has absolutely no distinct style it is a lifeless husk without form or anything resembling a cinematic look just like one other reviewer put it boyhood felt like watching a home movie about someone you dont know and dont care about i cant remember a single scene where i thought wow thats a neat shot or a moment where some cinematographic choice actually enhanced the scene that tells a lot about the cinematographic effort and choices that were put into this film bland and uninspired is to put it mildly the editing does the film no favors either right when something emotional or important could have happened the movie simply cuts to another scene and doesnt reference or deal with what happened previously in any way it all felt terribly directionless for example mason ellar coltrane gets bullied in a school bathroom okay great probably something many of us can identify with how did it get to this? how does he deal with it later on and how does it affect him? we simply dont know its a wholly detached scene with no meaning at one point theyre planting obama signs on peoples lawns great maybe theyre idealistic about the political system and theyd later revise their views or something? nope none of that is ever mentioned or dealt with in any way again most of the scenes are like this and go absolutely nowhere when the film actually goes back to something that was introduced earlier it feels extremely contrived like with the bit about masons mom advising a latino immigrant about going to school and how he later comes back to thank her for that encouragement really subtle guys there were a few scenes where i was slightly amused and that mostly about how awkward the scene was but mostly i was just constantly cringing at how bad the acting and the writing were i guess thats the risk you run into when you cast young actors and stay with them for twelve years  they might just not be that good at acting ellar coltrane seemed like hed had a shot of horse tranquilizer before every scene hes that apathetic and dull the characters have no real depth or character arcs and i didnt care or get attached to any of them masons philosophic rants were cringeworthy and uninteresting they also seem to come out of nowhere and therefore feel unearned at no point did i think that they really struck a chord with what it was like growing up during the 90s and the 2000s i was simply depressingly bored for most of the movie many have complimented this movie about being close to real life well thats debatable but that shouldnt be an automatic positive either watching paint dry and standing in the line in the grocery store is real life too i dont want to see banal mindlessness when i go to the movies but maybe thats just me a film this ambitious should really have something original to say instead it just wasted my timenegative,i found this movie to be overly long full of itself endlessly oppressive virtually humorless and overall not worth your time thats my summary but in order to add imdbs required 10 lines on the plus side it was well made so it does draw you in but the long scenes in space juxtaposed with the ugly scenes on earth were just too much for me to watch i eventually sat with my eyes closed so as not to continue to be bombarded by those scenes i didnt want to leave as i had gone with others and eventually covered my ears for the same reason the scenes may be beautifully shot but they are in the end very slow and boring this film should have been half the length and have added twice as much lightnessnegative,i found this film very disturbing and it was a waste of my time going to see the film i found that it took awhile to understand the story and there wasnt much of an introduction of the characters throughout the entire film i thought that johnny depp was better in the pirate of the caribbeans franchise overall the film was ok in some parts of the film can the makers of the film please make a better version of the movie and call it a different name and maybe if they put more work into it and had better scripts i would be more satisfied with the film i recommend this film to people who hate science fiction as it really brings out the weaknesses and errors that occurs in sciencenegative,i followed this series through the first season and kept thinking this guy stephen amellhas got to get better some how well that hasnt materialized i dont think stephen amell could make someone think he had to defaecate if he had a box of laxatives i i came across someone in real life with the emotion the characters display in this series im assume right away that they needed mental help its like people who didnt work out anywhere else all wound up here such a huge pool of bad talent and whats up with the mother and daughter do they have herpes? what the hell is on their lips?grossnegative,i dont usually give a 110 even for utter trash everything about this movie is a liepropaganda peasants love johnny depp and morgan freeman so the popular guys are playing the scientists rushing to replace humanitys future with an ai they control which will answer the deep mysteries of life just good guys with good intentions? right? look up ray kurzweil who is director of engineering at google there are mega rich people funding ai research and want to become gods or immortal when their personalities are uploaded onto the internet so will caster is a smug atheist who isnt working with government bulls*** and he is poisoned by a terrorist trying to save humanity o lets try and upload him into a computer not because he would love to be a god but because some terrorist killed him bulls*** basically transcedence is richest 1% getting overruling over the rest of us even after death the horrornegative,i dont understand why this movie has 85 imdb rating its pretty boring movie acting is pretty lame its not engaging at all basically if you are not under 13 youll start yawning and checking your phone more than the movie i felt like im watching a live play act rather than a movie direction acting and animation felt like it was done by amateurs ive seen better acting in a fan base remake of other movies and better animation in video game trailers there are quite a few scenes where its so dark that you cant make anything out storyline is very short and not enough for a movie in the end it shows that they will be back next time or something i hope they dont as i wont be watching it at least not in the theater anyways waste of timenegative,i dont know why walt disney movies have become so dull and tasteless the story of cinderella is a great storybut the acting is simply terrible and the movie is so boring the story of cinderella follows the fortunes of young ella whose merchant father remarries following the tragic death of her mother keen to support her loving father ella welcomes her new stepmother lady tremaine and her daughters anastasia and drizella into the family home but when ellas father suddenly passes away she finds herself at the mercy of a jealous and cruel new family finally relegated to nothing more than a servant girl covered in ashes and spitefully renamed cinderella since she works in the cinders ella could easily begin to lose hope yet despite the cruelty inflicted upon her ella is determined to honor her mothers dying words to have courage and be kind she will not give in to despair nor despise those who abuse her and then there is the dashing stranger she meets in the woods unaware that he is really the prince and not merely an employee at the palace ella finally feels she has met a kindred soul it appears as if her fortunes may be about to change when the palace sends out an open invitation for all maidens to attend a ball raising ellas hopes of once again encountering the charming kit

mice changes cinderellas life forever disney failed to make a masterpiece from this clichmost kids including my children hated this film and found it boring and uninteresting the story of cinderella has been extremely overusedi dont know why disney insists on making a new modern version from this clich definitely disney needs to make a lot of money i advise you to avoid this moviebut if you wanna

can escape from the black hole but the visible light does not have the enough energy i guest there are other very obvious mistakes haha it is said that the hero gets in the 5d space let us make an example in 1d world the ant would be blocked by a spot however when the ant get into the 2d world the spot would not be the block anymore which means the block in lower dimension would not be the block anymore in a higher dimension thus if the hero gets in the 4d world i dont think he would be block in the black hole and he gets in the 5d world~~~~ hahanegative,i dont have a huge amount to say about this film as i feel absolutely nothing happens within the space of 3 very long hours for those of you who have taken the time to read my review and have watched the film i have a question would you praise this film to the extent that is has been if you hadnt watched the actors grow up over the course of 12yrs? would this film have been as critically acclaimed if they had used different actors as they grew like the majority of films? my personal answer is no and my reason being that the dialogue is tedious thrown in with a lot of unlikable characters im not denying the concept is brilliant and original however overall this film did nothing for me except remind me the annoyance of pubertynegative,i do not understand any of the good reviews of this movie i think that its hook is the gimmick of the kids growing up in it but there is nothing redeeming or even entertaining about this movie it was terrible the story bordered on depressing the trailer leads one to believe that this is a documentary of a childs life but it is not there are actors in it it was awful just awful and i do hope it will not end up winning an oscar surely someone could do a coming of age movie better or a documentary set over 12 years better i wish i could understand what the reasoning behind the good reviews i watched the movie and i just cannot see itnegative,i do not know what kind of pr team the production team has hired to promote this film but obviously they are doing great job as it has already higher  than inception seriously guys??? this film has 510 stars at best and even that for just potential rest of it is lost because the film has absolutely no logic to it stupid illogical and at times really boring and long even though i am no scientist it was so stupid on so many levels with even the most basic of facts that i have no comments to this set your expectations low no way in hell does this film deserve any of that praise posted herenegative,i didnt always vote on imdb but if my twocents could warn people not to let their hope up on this movie or not waste their time watching at all i would however if you like a lousy crime thriller film wannabe this one is your very choice i am wondering why gone girl is getting a pretty good  here 84 huh? are you kidding me? are people not seeing that noticeably fat plot hole? i had raised my brows at how cops in this movie worked since their first appearance the writer had no knowledge how the system worked but he dare try to write a crime fiction he used many wrong imagination so what we got and paid for is this pieceofs i mean art gone girl tells a story of a manipulative lady who got a bunch of idiots around her so compared to them she was real smart one day she thought shed set her cheating husband up for a murder so she sent him out and drove her evil plan in motion she drew out her blood threw it around the house then cleaned the house not knowing when her husband would come home and discover all of it luckily he didnt come home before she got away for her everything was perfect timing and a piece of cake as the film went on and on everybody believed what she said and ate what she served without any doubts in their mind this sounds very mary sue to me every cops in the writers world worked like an amateur they worked fast too fast but use no brains they didnt work the evidences or traced any phones they used only what she fed them fbi wouldnt do anything about a bloody murder even though the feds had the murderer sitting in front of them soaking in blood confessing and not even feeling freaked out although she told the cops that she had been kidnapped and raped and then the cops let her husband drive her home still soaking in blood when i saw that scene i was going to fall apart thats it thats the whole story tell me she used some kind of dark magic that would be more reasonable than everybody in the world being an idiot and listening to this mary sues words regardless this movie was disappointingnegative,i decided to give this film a go out of a love for classic disney pre digital angelina jolies striking image and the fantasy element sadly angelina jolies image is the only successful aspect of this film what a surprise that is the only image associated with the film elle fanning is in the kindest terms distinctly average and certainly not blessed with grace or a beauty by any great stretch of the imagination neither can she act sharlto copley is also incredibly overrated and should only be considered for minor supporting roles there is no character development copleys character is shown as a love interest then we are told not shown that he is ambitious next thing he is evil and cuts off maleficents wings and becomes inherently bad  this makes no sense when maleficent finds her wings stolen we see her mourn for them for a few seconds at most next thing she is evil while the cgi is good the fairy fantasy element is shallow  remember how rich with emotion action humour and charm the animal scenes were in snow white and the seven dwarfs? i expected a certain amount of darkness and menace something to give us an emotional journey  this was completely lacking all in all a wasted opportunity of a film it would be forgettable if it didnt infuriate me so muchnegative,i created an imdb account because of this movie it is the worst dragged out boring try hard words i dont think exist garbage ive ever seen please give me my money and 3 hours of life back when im on my deathbed in 5060 hopeful years riddled with dementia and parkinsons divorced 8 times with kids who hate me and nothing but an unmarked grave to look forward to my biggest regret in life will no doubt be watching this film i wanted to jump off my 12th story balcony 30 minutes in i wanted to jump off my 12th story balcony strapped to a flaming 2 tonne anvil with a noose around my neck and 8 pounds of plastic c4 set to detonate on impact 1 hour in so on and so forth why did i finish watching you ask? well cause i was hoping pleading praying to the holy jesus lord above that this movie would get better maybe have an exciting plot twist maybe just maybe not continue being a dreadfully boring and inconceivably lame story of a teenager and his regular as f**k life and then what boom? its over? at least give me a micheal bay explosion on that bland cliff hes sitting on thats it im done not wasting anymore time on this horrible boring waste of my according to this film thrilling life tips for watching this movie step 1 wait for it to come out on dvd step 2 take out massive loan from bank step 3 buy all the copies you can of this movie step 4 put all copies through wood chipper step 5 burn with fire step 6 cry tears of joy for being a superhero step 7 weep tears of sorrow for all those who find this movie deserves ten stars for i cant begin to imagine the excitement of a day in their livesnegative,i couldnt rate any lower than 1 so i guess it gets a 1 how on earth does this stuff get green lit? i dont understand this type of movie may have been good in 1981 but in 2014 there is no excuse the plot is completely ludicrous the dialogue is horrible i think hes fragmented seriously? i found myself bursting out with laughter at the ridiculousness of the entire movie how many eye rolling minutes can you pack into a movie? id rather watch paint dry complete and utter failure i love movies i love when i watch a movie and i am reminded why i love movies it will take 23 good movies to get over the sour taste this movie left in my mouth avoid at all costs do not give them a reason to even consider making something else along these linesnegative,i could not have believed quite how bad interstellar is it is truly dreadful after six months travelling with just 12 minutes to go to entering the wormhole the token blackman speaks to the hero who has his suntan intact massa massa what is going on? the hero then takes a piece of paper and explains to the poor ignorant black man how space warps in a wormhole if he didnt know this wtf was he doing on the trip? their understanding of relativity is at the level id expect from my goldfish they give plenty of time to grotesque emotional watching of film clips from earth  for some reason in b&w the hero goes through as dorothy parker said all the emotions from a to b they claim it is a post colonial world but the space suits all have the us flag on them the spaceship controls are circia 1960 poor michael cain is he so short of money that he has to be pare of this shite? to be fair it is unconsciously funny from time to time because it is so utterly clueless avoid this film if you possibly cannegative,i checked the spoiler box just in case but nothing happens nothing to spoil huge waste of time everyone is allowed to formulate their own opinion about movies but i would highly recommend to stay away from boyhood this movie is terrible it is filmed over a twelve year period yes twelve same actors and actresses the movie is 2 hours 46 minutes long and we had to turn it off at 2 hours2 hours of my life i will never get back i love all kinds of movies action adventure drama comedy even a chick flick now and then but this movie went nowhere did nothing and ended up like every other person in life see it for yourself but you have been warned cant figure out how its up for 6 award nominations other than the artsy fartsy crowd loves this kind of crapnegative,i cant believe they wasted one of the best tv shows ever simply to make a vehicle for an increasingly geriatric tom cruise and i cant believe that constant bulgy teary eyes topgun gape and all caps sentences every annoying moment of the movie is what defines good acting in hollywood these days sigh and what is there to think about in this movie?? tom cruise in starting frame tom cruise gets double teamed tom cruise gets mad tom cruise gets teary eyed tom cruise exclaims constantly did you order the code red tom cruise kills bad guy with a helicopter and a train tom cruise saves the day tom cruise in last frame has any tom cruise movie been any different?? i wish that helicopter blade had made those two extra inchessigh would have made my daynegative,i cant believe anyone found this movie even mildly entertaining let alone brilliant even more preposterous are the comparisons to 2001???? like all of nolans other movies interstell im not going to write synopsis or give details but simply share my opinion there was nothing even remotely good about this film it attempted to blend ideas and plots from past scifi films but in the end turned out to be a disconnected and poorly developed mess everything from the crap science to the uninteresting characterscheesy and awkward dialog to the story or lack thereof made this film unwatchable the characters did not come off like scientists they didnt even come off like people in such dire situations would such as making jokes about being an asshole when confronted by a massive black hole anne hathaways character was particularly inferior i seriously wanted someone to strangle her of course this could have been excused if the movie didnt take itself so serious or had some redeeming qualitiesaspects however the film tries so hard to be profound but it ends up being awkward the endnegative,i cannot understand how such a capable cast could make such a dog of a movie didnt they read the script before they accepted the roles? the premise of the film is stupid and as such assumes people are stupid add this to the ponderous and boring pace of the movie a bunch of uninteresting characters who are impossible to relate to and a totally predictable and contrived ending on it and you have all the ingredients of a hollywood trainwreck the dvd was described as action this is false advertising what little action there is is about as exciting as watching paint dry the copy i rented had the worst case of bad sound really soft dialogue contrasted with action sounds that almost took the back wall out of my lounge room if i werent so bored maybe i wouldnt have noticed im really glad i didnt pay more than an overnight rental on this but really wish i could have the 2 or so hours of my life i wasted watching this rubbish backnegative,i cannot believe there is people that liked this movie not only it lacks any kind of realism any kind of acting and any kind of plot but also it shows us such an old load of clich_ that you will be asking for your money back it seems to be impossible for this movie being directed by brian de palmanegative,i cannot believe there is people that liked this movie not only it lacks any kind of realism any kind of acting and any kind of plot but also it shows us such an old load of clich that you will be asking for your money back it seems to be impossible for this movie being directed by brian de palmanegative,i cannot believe how disappointed i was watching this film form all of the reviews i thought i was about to see a modern classic in instead i watched a movie so lacking in common sense that the last hour was almost unwatchable the plot is very obvious even the ending without giving away any plot lines it seems that in this film common sense and the trail of evidence does not exist once the real story is revealed as the last hour of the movie dragged on and on i was hoping for some redeeming scene that would make everything right or at least make sense unfortunately this did not happen maybe one of the worst good movies ive ever scene if this is what people think is good plot twists then the iq of movie watchers has gone down into the single digitsnegative,i can not understand why anyone would enjoy this movie i actually got up and walked out halfway through there was so much gratuitous violence that i couldnt stand it splattering blood everywhere in order to explain myself there will be a few spoilers here but i will try and keep them to a minimum so if you want to be surprised dont read any further but i wouldnt be surprised if i were you we were and i am still angry about it i will say that several of the cast members were very good the premise of the movie is juvenile 5 minutes into the movie someone got split in half this gimmick was repeated later in the movie samuel jackson plays a black billionaire who dresses like flava flav and serves mcdonalds to who he thinks is a billionaire donor seriously? then there was the whole shoot the dog bit really how original but when everyone started killing each other in the church i was done if you are a thirteen year old boy with anger issues this movie is right up your alley i went on line to read what happens at end of the movie and was glad i made the decision to leave the movie how many times to you blow up a persons head and call it entertainment? it really bothers me that some people find this entertaining this was one step above a snuff film masquerading as a parodyhomage to james bond also am i the only one who got the subliminal message with the obama look alike who gets killed? seriously? there are not enough words to describe how bad this movie is if you enjoy blood and people getting killed rather graphically ad nausea then you will enjoy this movie if you want to see anything remotely resembling a decent movie you will notnegative,i came here to check the reviews and i was mislead so here i am hoping that people will see this and not bother first thing that you notice is the bad actingpersonal opinion and man that is annoying the show itself is decent but not much of plot development and the story is repeating and boring so unless they have something hidden that is gonna blow our mind im gonna have to stop watching this show if you have a lot of time to spend you can watch it but dont expect much from it or you will be very very disappointed another thing that hits you after a couple episode is the over the board acting with punch line here and there i know it sounds like a lot of hate but just so you know this is my first review in imdb i always come here to check some of them this show is overrated and doesnt deserve the reviews in herenegative,i bought the studio hype that this was the most intelligent sicfi film since 2001 space odyssey what an insult to kubrick like the dark knight rise interstellar is 3 long hours of torture from the moment mccanaughey accidentally stumbles upon nasas gigantic secret launch operation  just happens to be in a cornfield a few miles from him and they never noticed and by the way as long as youre here could you pilot the mission? we just never had any plans for a pilot until you barged in christ this is a plot device from gilligans island the rest of this turkey might be summed up as weepy soap opera in outer space too many schmaltzy tearjerker scenes for an intelligent sicfi film anne hathaway acts more like a chirpy cheerleader than a seasoned astronaut and like dark knight the plot is so convoluted that i eventually gave up caring the final scenes perhaps somewhat inspired by 2001 are lame and pretentious id rather be waterboarded than suffer through nolans dreck again im giving this 1 star to balance the ludicrous spate of 910 star reviews no wonder american film has gone downhill when the audiences mistake a pretentious poorly written fruit pie for the masterpiece of a geniusnegative,i am wondering if the people who write intertstellar 10star reviews are actually sane or if they base their opinion on a movie library completely deprived of everything that is scifi basically if the sicfi component  most of which does not really happen until the end  is removed from the plot the movie by and large is a classic hollywood soap opera the wornout rag of clich family relations all americandad complicated love affair unruly and a classic tomboygirl coworkers more like coidiots who rebel and despite all common sense act irrationally you know to up the ante it really makes up 90% of this movie up until half way trough i honestly considered walking away from this boring tragedy which is the lack of creative talent on the part of the script writers and director there are also very obvious holes in the plot and not just irregularities but direct contradictions that even the most obnoxious sicfi movies at least try to amend somehow i can not help but think that after watching automata which was a breath of fresh air in many regards this movie is like walking into a small toilet where someone just took a huge dump it is literally that bad what saves this movie by the skin of its teeth is the ending so just watch that instead because until then you could have just as well been watching an episode of santa barbara spolers about ridiculous plot holes as if the soap part of the movie is not stressed enough 1 the stupid dust bowl recycled seriously? i am not even going to try to explain this because id need to repost have of wikipedia here but it does not work that way not in the past  not in the future 2 the moment nasa abducts the main character and daughter and questions them seriously? maybe they should also have shot them on sight? 3 nasas facility is top secret right in the age supposedly after the present when there are drones and google maps they manage to hide a huge facility in some old james bond villain fashion 4 lets go to another galaxy ok if the movie shows a fairly conventional rocket carrying a futuristic shuttle why for the love of all holy would anyone risk going there  instead of looking in our own? what they really expected to have better luck there  than in our own? they already searched the entire milky way? and whats even better  it just so happens there is a planet like a stones throw away from the black hole and is not being consumed by it and somehow a black hole which is now proved to be a collapsed star is anything but a collapsed star? why lets just start diving down toilets because you know they are not full of s*** but are actual doorways to different dimensions like dimensions of dementia perhaps 5 saving the best for last  i did like the ending despite its absurdity i did like it almost cried  if i were a 14 year old girl with especially fragile psychology but i digress the machine that allows the main character to conviniently contact his daughter in the future past is built by the very humanity he is trying to save that survived and built the machine in the future lord have mercy i will try to explain this so basically if we consider all major theories about time travel in order to change the future one must go there and change it right? but here the future changes the past and that past is what changed the future with the help of the future that is changed in the past with the changed futures help mind >>> blownnegative,i am wondering if the people who write intertstellar 10star reviews are actually sane or if they base their

good perhaps its just recent yet and in time people will figure out their mistake lets face it the plot is ridiculous working around a music themed heroic saga through the galaxy when the songs themselves are either plain bad or do not represent quite well the moment plot problems will also go by too many characters presented in a way that seems like weve seen them before but we dont really remember where from well maybe another movie like the collector nova prime or korath and many many clich_s but the worse part for me was the cheesy dialogs and the absolutely ridiculous jokes i couldnt laugh even once and i do tend to have a good sense of humor the joke about slipping the finger on your neck  really? and rocket demanding a mans artificial leg for nothing to say later that that was a joke  absolutely unnecessary on top of its nonsense the final scene ronan is about to finally get his revenge has the power to do so is about to do so then at the very last moment he stops to watch quill dancing while others prepare to blast him oh forget the fulfilling of my greatest desire the one driving my whole life and existence lets just stop and watch him dance seriously? was that supposed to be funny? am i a tenyearold boy watching woodpecker? 2 min of thinking would have sufficed to come up with a not so childish way to do that scene what a great plot indeed maybe i could be going too hard on a film supposed to just entertain with lights and sound but it bothers me how stupid they think we are when they treat us like children one very good side though that saved this movie from total awfulness is the beautiful cgi images not all but many specially those from space and star warslike spaceship battles every single other marvel movie was better than this  and not all were exactly good if the sequence is going to be as good as the first one please dont even start it marvel and not to forget some one has to tell nasa that to prevent people from dying from a spacecraft falling down on earth you just need to make a sphere shield made out of entangled branches and leaves awesomenegative,i am so disappointed in this movie the ratings gave me high expectations for this movie but i feel really let down this movie was meant to capture the true essence and experience of growing up and going through life it is directed and acted out so neutrally to try to make the movie as real as possible but this is not reality reality has more emotion more struggle more comedy and more life life is not an objective biography or recollection of events it is a subjective frenzy i can make a movie of me watching this movie and make it more alive tldr this movie about life is more boring than life itselfnegative,i am sick and tired of hollywoods inaccuracies in the films they produce from amistads horrendous lies about its stories of slavery to tyler perry making me believe that he is an actual elderly black woman hollywood keeps pooping out new flicks that focus entirely on the entertainment and not at all on the facts and its safe to say that boyhood was the worst of all this movie made me so livid that i wanted to cut my freaking cats ear off the film portrayed a boy as he grew from five to seventeen years old in front of the audiences eyes he lived in a mostly happy household with only a few minor obstacles but nothing too severe that the family couldnt handle it except that one part the people who have viewed the film will know what part i mean boyhood did not represent childhood in a realistic way and it especially did not represent my childhood i was born in a small town in nebraska on the dance floor of a strip club off the interstate where my mom happened to be dancing that night many people took their dollars back off the stage the moment i popped out i emerged from my mothers uterus with a feeling of ambition a feeling that i could take the world by storm however my father a flight attendant had other plans for me once i got my basic motor movements down he had me training to be just like your old man as he put it pops made me train for hours on end serving drinks and peanuts to family friends and relatives while always keeping a phony smile on my face by the age of three i knew the safety procedure speech like the back of my hand and keep in mind this was before i even knew the alphabet or my own name all i ever wanted to do was juggle for a living i once told him about my desire to attend juggling camp for a week over the summer he replied by saying i bet youd like to handle all those balls wouldnt you? stick to flight attending son its a mans job i was devastated the idea of being able to keep more than one ball in the air at a time mesmerized me for years to come but i could never make my dreams known for fear of what my father might do once i graduated from high school my dad pulled some strings and got me a job as a flight attendant at the nearest airport he had retired at this point he said he did it because 911 really sucked balls he was so excited that i was following or should i say flying in his footsteps but the day i was supposed to start the job i did not make it to the airport for i was on my way to follow my dreams i hit the open road looking for the nearest juggling college the existential feeling of bliss that i felt from the freedom of being out of my fathers control was more than i had ever felt before but it quickly diminished for i learned that there is no such thing as juggling college amateur mistake blake amateur mistake i ran out of money fast having spent it all on an expensive juggling set i had planned on showing off to all the other kids at juggling college so that i could be one of the cool kids i hooked for a little bit but no one would take my body i have a bad hunching problem and a massive rash on my back so it kind of looks like molten lava rushing down the side of a volcano when i take my shirt off i had nowhere to go no one to turn to for many a days i ate garbage from a dumpster behind burger king which i know sounds redundant since their food is already garbage i got food poisoning thrice over the course of a year reluctantly i knew what i had to do i tucked my tail in between my legs and made the long journey home back to my parents i knocked on the door and asked my dad for forgiveness no son of mine will be a juggler not on my watch he yelled but dad i pleaded you are forever shunned from this household he said with an icy look then he slammed the door in my weary face i am still homeless i have no money and nowhere to go i recently beat a man with one of my expensive juggling pins in a fight over a box of raisin bran its brutal out there let me tell you i figured out this family was going on vacation for a couple weeks so i am currently squatting in their home i came to see boyhood because i rented it on their credit card and i am also stealing their internet to write this review i just needed to get my thoughts on how unrealistic boyhood was out in the open because i checked and i didnt see anyone else complaining about this i mean cmon hollywood where was the part about flight attendants? where were the parts about the boys love for juggling and his dads denial of any pursuit of the boys dreams? huh????? because tell me if im wrong but i didnt catch those parts it really baffles me how well you hollywood bigwigs botched this great idea for a movie call me when you make a good movie for once im done with this bs ps dont call me because i dont own a phone because im homeless because my dad shunned me for my love of juggling sincerely your fellow imdb user blakelogsdon1negative,i am really amazed at the good reviews this is getting on here as i found it a huge disappointment absolutely nothing about it makes any sense in fact no single moment in the film follows logically from anything that was happening 15 minutes earlier the science is ridiculous a sixinch deep ocean with 200foot waves is one of the more believable elements the motivation of the characters changes from minute to minute and they seem bound and determined to make the worst choice whenever faced with a decision the special effects are unimaginative kubrick did it all better without cgi 50 years ago the bombastic musics only virtue is that it drowns out the ludicrous dialogue and the final resolution of the central mystery is utterly nonsensical involving manually transmitting what must be many many gigabytes of data in morse code via the second hand of an old wristwatch wt*? definitely not recommendednegative,i am not a huge fan of blockbusters so maybe i am not the target audience of this movie but i do enjoy them from time to time but this movie was a huge disappointment and frankly it was one of the worst mainstream movies i have seen in cinemas granted i have not seen many movies in cinemas in recent years it reminded me of another movie which i consider as one of my least favourite movies wanted to be honest there are many elements of that movie that have been used in this movie and frankly it seemed like a partial remake of that one the first problem was maybe colin firth i thought he was so incredibly miscast it seemed awkward to see him do the church fight and the fight with the thugs he was saying such corny annoying lines which would not seem out of place in one of those bollywood movies where the hero is all powerful even in comparison those movies at least seem more original many of the characters reminded me of many older movies the same old rough kid being trained to fight story has been done over and over again the whole banter between the posh guys and eggsy is cringeworthy the lead actor who played the role of eggsy has zero presence and is pretty much forgettable he really doesnt have the look for such a role i guess also this movie was mostly supposed to be funny but most of the humor elements fall absolutely flat what was the point of the head explosions? that was absolutely the worst scene that i have seen in cinemas in recent years i expected something much more substantial and believable but that really disappointed me the church fight was also stupid and meaningless just meaningless violence but without the beauty of john woo or even movies like the matrix the whole movie is so cynically geared to getting a reaction from teenage boys i am just surprised that there was no eye candy pretty much throughout the movie sure there were women but there are no suggestive sexual scenes maybe that last one in the end and another thing that i disliked was the use of classic rock music like freebird it seemed like an insult to this song to be associated with such tripe now lastly the presence of samuel jackson didnt really elevate the movie much he does better than the other actors but as far as i can remember he doesnt really have many memorable lines or scenes in this movie but i am thankful he is involved in the movie since that made it a little bearable for me and i was able to finish it there are just too much unbelievable fight scenes and ridiculous things like head explosions which have been done more realistically by tom savini in low budget 80s movies church fights and so on i know my rating is a little harsh since samuel jackson is not so bad but i am just rating as far as my personal experience is concerned 310negative,i am a bit of a cinema buff and i have seen quite a few efforts from all over the world dating back to the very dawn of the art form this is worst film i have ever seen  it looked like an amateur home video to me except it was much much much much much longer too absurd and stupid to be really boring however this pseudo intellectual psychological stink bomb probably is held in awe by lovers of star wars and starbucks coffee the only fun i had while watching this disaster was trying to guess how it would end well i also had fun laughing at how badly written this movie was so i suppose in that sense i have to admit it was enjoyable to participate in this flaccid collapsing 911 of cinema i kept asking my girl friend when will this end? a few times i thought they were ready to pull the plug but no  like dracula it seemed to have eternal life it kind of just petered out one day and i think that maybe they just ran out of money or someone pounded a stake through the plastic kodak fixed focus they were using as a camera they certainly didnt run out of ideas because there were none to be found i am really astounded at how amateurish this piece of garbage was sorry i really cant do a more thoughtful profound review of this mess  my brain just wont do itnegative,i always liked sifi movies the alien saga 2001 space odyssey gravity and even star wars of course they invite you to dream about extraterrestrial creatures exploration of the cosmos interstellar fights and what might be like living beyond the earth well interstellar falls very short at that why? simply because it goes well beyond what it is possible and lets keep it clear i am stating that in a bad sense after nasas orion struggles on building a shuttle to send humans to asteroids and even mars for the sake of what? interstellar illustrates us how to even get into black holes scape out of them and see your own daughter dying while you still have more energy and time to keep procreating what is next? it is a shame that a gang can keep you nearly three hours while getting your money to brief you about real science and the new fifth dimension with which that you can communicate through the 3d space and time bad bad and badnegative,how disney could take a classic story involving a wonderfully evil character and make her into a victim of male abuse is beyond me its a terribly misguided attempt to influence our daughters to mistrust and find fault with men even the wonderful fairies in the original story who saved protected provided love and a good upbringing for snow white have those outstanding feminine qualities taken away from them they are reduced to bumbling caretakers who watch over her until maleficent finds her and eventually becomes her benefactor i dont think we as a society should try to right a wrong with another wrong if the powerful women in hollywood think that hollywood produces movies that portray women in less than desirable ways there is no reason to counter attack with this awful story aimed at the impressionable psyche of our children if you have concerns about your daughters and sons viewing a story about abusive men and psychologically damaged women getting revenge stay away from this movie let children have their childhood and take them to movies that are age appropriatenegative,how can anyone give this film 1010 ? it lasts for 3 hours and for the first hour nothing happens they could have condensed the first hour to 10 minutes poor plot nasa developing a secret base because the public would not support spending on such expensive waste of money err maybe they would have spotted the dirty great big rocket launching and wonder what it was ?? how about picking the most ridiculous planet that orbits a black hole? you would never be able to develop and further space as anything in orbit had 7 years for every hour on the surface that stupid puddle planet  and the statement that the explorer had just arrived in their time due to relativity ?? err it took 2 years for them to get to jupiter where the wormhole was so assuming they did not leave until they reported back they would have been on the surface for 2 years why cant the transmit back real information  i may have missed that when they can send video messages ? sending back fake data about a planet that is frozen and has ammonia i the air so that it looks good is lame as hell you picked someone to go on a mission through a wormhole alone but they crumble about dying on a frozen planet is stupid anyway you could spot what the planet was like from a long long way to know it was fake hmm turning the robot into a bomb that self destructs ? why ? could they not spot when they landed it was fake? ie a frozen landscape for miles around is not what i would have called a viable planet ahh yes and sending messages back through the wormhole using gravity to encode data in the watch ticking using morse code ????? pathetic i had no joy watching this film except when it went off science fiction this is notnegative,his 4th dud in a row a ridiculous plot for some reason the earth is reduced to only producing corn so no animals birds or fish even though the scene by a lake the water looked clean and refreshing seems like humanity have forgotten that we can grow things in greenhouses and even underground never mind lets move on once again nolans characters all scientists and supposedly super intelligent do the most stupid things anne hathaway goes in the water to retrieve a large piece of debris when a large wave appears she has on hand a robot who could lift this wreckage with one hand but does not instruct him to do so the beardy scientist is by the spacecraft door urging her to get a move on the wave gets nearer the robot goes and carries her to the shuttle the beardy scientist all this while stays put just outside the door and lets the wave carry him away just one example of quite fewthe biggest plot hole is this for some reason once cooper is past the black hole and in 5 dimensional space he becomes super intelligient because he now knows how to solve the problem of gravity and save mankind how he knows this we do not know given that he is just an engineer to be able to figure out something the greatest physicists of the last hundred years cannot is unbelievable he then sends probably the most complicated and long equation in history to his daughter in basic morse code anyone familiar with morse code will tell you that this would take forever now to the film making others have mentioned its look  well to me it looked shabby endless shots of aircraft wings no vistas no shots of the galaxy or stars during both the wormhole sequence and the black hole sequence he stays on the actors in close in fact thank god i did not see this in imax would have been a complete waste of time and now the noise with hans zimmers worst and most bombastic   added onto very loud sound effects with the actors shouting to be heard we came a away with very bad headaches the end did not make any sense at all but we have the usual nolan fan base that cannot see past their noses all going ape over this and the usual batch of critics with no critical faculties whatsovernegative,heres the bottom line i think there should be an exception for these imdb reviews considering theres really nothing of absolute revelation or a spectacular climax everything you thought of going on in an ordinary persons life that could happen happens thats it again this isnt a spoiler you already knew what happens in this movie before even seeing the trailers trust me youre not missing anything stay home and watch videos of your own family through the years youll be happy you did i will add that if ethan hawke wins the oscar for supporting actor i wouldnt have a problem with it he did do a good job at the rolenegative,having built high expectations from an almost 10 out of 10 imdb rating and portrayed as a great spy thriller in the reviews we went to watch the movie but were extremely and totally disappointed and disgusted with everything in the movie the storyline and direction were aimless and weak the actors were made to show off their horribly cheap and duplicate quality james bond type weaponry tricks and style the movies plot and screening seems so stupid that the director would have been better off creating a spoof for a james bond type movie instead anyway such movies always get made but what i am most disappointed about is the fact that the imdb reviews & ratings were completely rigged imdb you need to watch out for such flaws in your feedback system cos that will bring down the rating of your service in process my suggestion if you are really really still interested in watching this movie then wait for a couple of week and it should be on tv for a free time passnegative,hated it most boring film of the year couldve followed someone a bit interesting for ten years rather than this boring tripe sit around the kitchen table go to school kitchen table school father in law gets drunk school table etc etc you get the idea thats it in a nutshell sorry for all the spoilers but turkey of the year for me do not understand how so many people like it probably many boring people relate to it hope it doesnt win any oscars there are many other films more worthy just because this is a unique film doesnt make it a good one acting is terrible and there is no plot obviously its just a 3 hour documentary following a family who get divorced but are still friends but im struggling to see the story here surely if you are going to do something as clever as is at least make it worthwhile most kids growing up have a trip to hospital it an accident this kid doesnt nowt didnt even have a personalitynegative,hard to sit through and terribly misleading its a shame that such content can be shown in our theaters commemorating death advocating women as sex symbols or damsels in distress and portraying mass murder as a cool action scene the first third of the movie has great action scenes that one would expect from a spy film easy to compare to the bond films however as the movie progressed the entire validity of the characters morals were flushed down the drain i and my two other adult friends had to cover our eyes and grimace at many scenes and we left all agreeing that we did not sign up for that sort of film the trailer did an awesome job at capturing my excitement then the movie did an equally great job of shattering that excitement i stress please watch at your own discretionnegative,hahahahhahahah this is the most original thing ive seen in the past years if only it were a comedyparody  thinking of it actually its funnier this way so nvm the comedyparody statement before i go on i have to say that ive never read green arrow but this is not the case here at all why its funny? for starters look at the review title this series is actually a soap opera everything about it is well with the exception that green arrow stars in it the directing is horrid so is the acting and the character lines the story looks ok and id really like to know how it unravels theres also hot women in it not something one wouldnt expect those last two facts are not enough for one to sit and watch it but theyre the reason why i rated with 310 and not 110 what i will do i propose you do the same is start reading the green arrow comic books and google for hot women instead of wasting my time watching this thing it was really fun hilarious tbh watching the first couple of episodes might be three cant recall but enough is enough nextnegative,guardians of the galaxy is just another mediocre film under the pretence of future it sneaked in embraces of the past perhaps it tried to be both but it was neither a serious film nor a comedy it failed to trigger any deeper emotion inside me its humour was out of context there were too many characters most of which were not properly developed the purposes of existence of those figures were very confusing ill comment in detail on the triggering of deeper emotions and the humour in the following 2 paragraphs someone commented that the films like the dark knights series set a standard that superhero films must be deep and thoughtful that person further commented that this film guardians of the galaxy challenged this standard i generally dont like dogmas but here its not at all about dogmas it is just the fact that those deep ones could trigger deeper emotions or provoke thoughts or inspire the audiences or help the audiences learn something or help the audiences learn themselves better by these the audiences like think about involuntarily recall remember and give high s for those deep films of course different people have different opinions on deepness so i dont comment on the deepness of guardians of the galaxy just commenting on triggering deeper emotions or provoking thoughts or inspiring me or helping me learn something or learn myself better unfortunately guardians of the galaxy did none of these to me so it just didnt make me feel that way that it was one of those alltime great films someone commented that guardians of the galaxy was not a serious film but rather it was a great lighthearted comedy even for this i dont think i could agree great humour exists in context in the right context something plain could be hilarious out of context brilliant jokes were just nothing in guardians of the galaxy too much humour ran out of context for example the raccoon said later that he asked for one prisoners prosthetic leg was just a joke what did this convey? it was clever to play such heartless jokes on your partners when it was time to be serious? no how about it tried to portray a figure the raccoon who was unfazed in front of great danger? but then you had to make the situation look dangerous even in the wizard of oz 1939 the scenes felt more creepy than here in the prison the prison here felt just like a noisy secondhand market so i didnt find the joke funny and didnt know why it was in the film otherwise either there were many such lines i knew they were intended to be something to make people laugh but i just didnt feel that entertained at those improper moments all in all guardians of the galaxy has no place on the alltime great list perhaps it was the last joke it could play on itself being put into the top 250 list among those great films its mediocrity would just manifest itself just within the first month of its release it dropped 20 places on the top 250 list from the 34th to the 54th as time goes on this film will likely drop further when the enthusiasm fades after its initial surge there are great films like in the name of the father 1993 a beautiful mind 2001 etc they were not on the top 250 list before but gradually rose up and emerged into the alltime great list just on the contrary guardians of the galaxy will gradually drop out of the top 250 listnegative,guardians of the galaxy is a new low for marvel and for the comic book sub genre in general no one was clamoring for a movie to be made from the comic book that almost no one had even heard of however because of the marvel brand and the stunning visuals and action sequences this became one of the highest grossing films of the year the film is no more than a cash grab and a stepping stone in setting up the second avengers the characters are trite and obvious and the villain i cant remember his name for the life of me could not have been more inconsequential or underdeveloped groot was the only part of the movie besides the visuals that was mildly interesting the story is ridiculous as well as the setting this movie has a higher rating on imdb than some of the best films of the year including foxcatcher the grand budapest hotel and the theory of everythingnegative,guardians of the galaxy has a great 70s soundtrack which is recommended to be listened to on your walkman while on your own adventures rather than as the  to this latest piece of hollywood marvel trash but that doesnt make up for a crap film with a pathetic childish storyline bs joke acting and zero suspense worse than that  it wasted karen gillan who is one of the hottest scifi girls on the planet and can act a whole better than the dumb talentless yanks she has the misfortune to share her pathetic amount of screen time with besides karen who is always fun the only character in this piece of juvenile junk with any charisma is a wooden tree voiced by vin diesel the rest is a total garbage film for the under 5s or idiots to enjoynegative,guardians of the craplaxy

show that no one associated with it ever watched and americans line up like sheep to see it this film along with other blockbusters like the grinch make me ashamed of our film industrymaybe these films are why the french hate us so much hmmmmm some bozo script writer has the wonderful idea to make the bad guy jim phelps he or she remembers hearing the name somewhere and it has a nice ring to it it should you idiothe was the hero from the original series that everyone loved while youre at it why not remake some other old tv shows that feature barney the dinosaur as a child molester or santa claus as an alcoholic? ahhhhhhhh then after irritating all the old fans lets create the dumbest special effects ever and base the entire movie around explosions and stuntseven though the original series used these very sparingly my favorite example was the banal chase sequence there we see the macho tom cruise riding the skids of a helicopter suddenly it blows up and he blasts forward onto the train he is pursuing and lands expertly on the train if this were really attempted it would cost the lives of 67000000 stunt men to get this stunt right providing that the laws of physics no longer applied during the duration of the stunt then because this was such a cool stunt other pictures included very similar stunts for the next year or so i was half expecting to see it in the next elmo movie america wake upstop attending mindnumbing megabudget movies just because they are marketed to us at every turn pssince i first posted this review tom cruises stupid public statements make me wish i could rank the movie lower than a 1man i am getting sick of seeing this guynegative,great characters intricate plots and an ensemble cast helped define the original mission impossible during the 1960s but the elements that made the original series so strong are all but lost in this first big screen effort it all starts out promising enough when we join the imf in the middle of a mission unfortunatley once the team members are systematically eliminated one by one we leave mission impossible behind and instead stumble into a high tech version of the fugitive with tom cruise again playing himself as he so often has in so many of his films this is a shame considering the strong supporting cast and the potential it had to be an intelligent and intriguing update of the original series the original concept and characters are betrayed by the writers and director brian depalma easy to follow and sit through but ultimately disappointing lets hope they get it right for the sequelnegative,gone girl psychopaths and woman beaters the first segment in the movie shows nick and amy dunnes marriage played by ben affleck and rosamund pike one day amy mysteriously disappears all attention is on nick as his reactions to the disappearing of his wife are distant and unsettling after nick is almost proved guilty it is revealed that amy planted all of the evidence in an attempt to get revenge on her husband we were all on her side at this point amys diary revealed that nick had beaten and sexually abused her as well as used all of her savings on senseless buys and then the film completely lost me amy reveals she faked the entire thing nick was not an abuser it is further understood amy has a history of making false rape accusations and more the film makes you sympathize with nick as he has become a victim of a psychopathic wife however nick still remains an incredibly unlikeable character who was taking advantage of a 20yearold amy then returns to her dissatisfied husband at this point i had completely given up on the film and was just waiting to see nick leave his psychopathic wife of course that wont happen instead the film ends with nick being trapped with amy after she confesses that she stole his sperm and impregnated herself gone girl had great potential but its plot twists ruined the film the acting was decent but the direction completely blurred the message if there even was a message at times even the actors looked like they couldnt believe how terrible the film was ultimately gone girl was unsatisfying and deeply disturbing but not in a good way the film tried way too hard to shock the audience but simply left us confused and deeply regretting ever even watching it gone girl was simply a huge waste of two hoursnegative,gone girl is based on a rather absurd premise a careful psychotic plot to frame somebody for your own murder this type of idea is clearly deranged but hopefully it does not cross too many peoples mind the idea was developed much better in the great noir film leave her to heaven where the framing was done in a slightly more subtle way but we do not live in subtle times so here we get plenty of gore and graphic violence even if this would be a spoiler for the few who still do not know the plot the story revolves around unhappy couple amy and nick ben affleck woody and expressionless as usual is creepy nick the unfaithful husband who for half an hour is the main suspect for the disappearance of amy beautiful rosamund pike is psycho crazy wife amy a woman with a demented agenda and several loose screws she manipulates every man she meets and at the end of the movie even police detectives are more than happy not to open an investigation on her crimes just because she is a beautiful blonde and they believe everything she said amys plotting is given away much too soon in the movie so we spend two very long hours just following the demented blonde around and nick getting in big trouble only for amy to resurface and deciding to spend the rest of her life with the husband she wanted to see executed does it make much sense? apparently yes since critics and lots of imdb users loved itnegative,god this show just doesnt get better when i saw the imdb ratings i thought i should give the show a try i mean it had an 8+ on imdb and i dont typically watch anything below 7 alright so apparently the show must be for someone else than me because after starting to watch it nothing justifies the good s okay so i kept going hoping that i was missing something  or maybe the good stuff just came later? but im now in the middle of season 3 and i have never wasted as much time as i have watching arrow who wrote *read stole* that plot? its not even stolen very well as it is obviously much much worse than any similar vigilante plots out there and you just after a few shows you will know exactly what will happen next and think to yourself no they wouldnt say that or do this cause that would just be dumb unoriginal and lame and then bum it happens and you get so embarrassed for the director honestly more than half of the episode i had to look away of embarrassment god i really dont understand how this show could get more than 55 at maximum so heres the main points  incredibly bad acting  plot is stolen directly from other novels & movies such as for instance batman  hell even ras al guhl is in it which is a monstrous disgrace  editing mediocre  not even the action scenes are good  no original bad guys either  what does it do good? well i guess i think i saw a lamborghini aventador somewhere in season 2 alright 2 stars  1 for the lambo and the other for the ability to fool such a large audience and somehow make it this far without being a total flop beyond my mind to figure out stay away dont waste your hours this show isnt even good for a rainy day unless youve already watched everything else there is to watch and even then id consider doing something else thats more exciting and less predictable  such as playing chessnegative,go colonize mars instead what was the point of the mission? to save humanity how? by evacuating all of earth on huge space stations to another planet accessible through a black hole near saturn and you need to gather data about the singularity to finish the antigravity equation to do it 1 direct trip from earth to saturn = 8 round trips from earth to mars so go colonize mars instead also the robot design was very impractical ps who colonizeslands on a planet with a 1 hour = 7 years outside time anomaly? pointless suicidenegative,for the life of me i cannot understand how this movie has received an 88 rating nor can i understand mathew mcconaughey he mumbles his way through the movie in such a thick texas drawl that english sub tittles are required not that he has anything interesting to say nor do any of the other characters for that matter so lets have a look at the plot the world has become pretty much uninhabitable due to some kind of climate change which has forced everyone to quit their jobs and become farmers the only solution to this problem is to send a rocket into space to locate a suitable planet for colonisation however everybody still drives around in massive gas guzzling suvs is there something wrong with this picture? in the normal run of events it would be impossible to travel the distances required to find another inhabited planet however a worm hole has been located somewhere near saturn which will facilitate interstellar travel its explained that this worm hole has not just appeared but rather it was placed there by some unspecified entity who is watching out for the human race so this unspecified entity has watched the human race make a complete horlicks of one perfectly good planet and now wants to give us the opportunity to do the same on another world? much hokum ensues regarding relativity and the way 1 hour for the astronauts is 10 years back on earth etc and it turns out in the end that it all has something to do with love but by the time they come to this conclusion i had lost interest the visual effects arent all that special seen it all before in fact i think the effects in 2001 aso which this film is so earnestly trying to emulate were superior if not in their execution than certainly in their creative vision in conclusion then a plot holier than a month of sundays a leading man to whom english is a second language nonsense dialogue and rather unimaginative visual effects adds up to 88? i dont think sonegative,firstly i need to say that i have mixed feelings about the director richard linklater and his movies i like his movies but i dont like his style i follow his movies but i dont particularly enjoy his way of storytelling if i consider his filmography briefly i liked his debut before sunrise it was a warm nice romance film even if it didnt meet my expectations fully i met a different film than the film in my mind however i called before sunset a masterpiece it was my movie unfortunately before midnight was a mind numbing experience for me because there was nothing but dialogs no cinema no art no drama we rather listened a story than watching a movie people talk talk and talk but mostly empty conversations not something which pushes audiences to think finally yesterday i saw boyhood and it was not a tiresome journey like before midnight thank goodness but again there was only a story without any background or even subtext if the message was life is empty then i swallow my words but i dont think so the movie consists of the daily routines of a boy and his family but the movie has not any real theme or has not anything to say to us i mean it has not come to any point other than very basic and naive things mr linklater cant catch even remarkable snapshots as he cant create remarkable moments during this almost three hours long movie i appreciate the movie only for its shooting technique which is a milestone for sure and it requires great devotion and great labor in the movie there are ceremonies cerebrations diners etc but there is no depth at all no point and of course no art the boys inner world his feelings his thoughts his soul none of those is showed or reflected by the director which is really pathetic the director never lets us deduce something this is not a growing up story this is not a movie about puberty crisis so what is the point? and the other main problem of the movie is that the boy including his family dont face with a real crisis or trouble or a problem and i know why because the director is too optimistic about life for example the biggest challenge in the boys life is presented as having a falling out with his girlfriend or moving out the boys sister supposedly stands for the flighty girls of today but it goes nowhere we are expected to feel sorry for the family when they have financial difficulty but personally i didnt because in the following scene we watch that the mother gives a splendid thanksgiving dinner to a bunch of people i think mr linklater hasnt seen bicycle thieves yet because otherwise he would have known struggling for life and being a kid in a world full of trouble this should have been a depressing movie in fact commonly it is said that this is a depressing movie but i believe just the opposite i had expected a depressing and realistic movie from boyhood as i had expected a moving and beautiful art film from before midnight or as i had expected seeing hardships of love relationships from before sunrise and dont expect an intense finale i did because life is bittersweetnegative,first this movie is a remake of an old series and secondly it has tom cruise in it tom cruise is not a bad actor it just annoys me that movie is focused completely around him as if he were god no wonder the germans hated this movie anyway i will give away the plot in this movie because i feel that you really dont need to see it the only reason i taped it and watched it was because jean reno was in it and he is quite a good actor tom cruise is ethan hunt the member of the imf team that performs impossible missions during a routine mission everything goes wrong and only hunt and the wife of jim phelps the leader of the team escape the american government believe that hunt is behind it and is a mole selling out to the enemy so order him arrested but he manages to slip through their fingers and even breaks into cia headquarters at langley virginia it ends up that jim phelps is the mole and that jean reno is the agent who is in it for the money the movie ends in a scene in the english channel tunnel where reno flies a helicopter through it and hunt tackles phelps on the back of a train this movie follows the theme of the end of the cold war and thus the intelligence agencies are no longer needed this is not an action packed movie but tries to follow the tenseness of the original series it is more about people trying to get into places which are very difficult to get into it as such it follows the style of sneakers which i believe is a far superior movienegative,first the good kenneth branagh does it again diversity in hollywood i loved seeing all of the people of non white heritage spattered about the landscape as if they all belonged there coodles to mr branagh for always thinking outside the white box now the bad the movie itself this was the most boring thing i ever sat through and i think that everyone in the small audience i was in on discount day thought the same anytime people leave a theater without saying a word its bad the dialog was the worst ive ever heard lily james is also the worst actress ive ever seen the saving grace was derek jacobi as the king his relationship with his son was far more interesting than cinderellas relationship with her entire family then there was the endless narration doesnt branagh know that the first rule of storytelling is show me dont tell me i guess he forgot in this film the landscapes were pretty but i got tired of the endless stream of colorful gowns that were way too big on the bottom then there was the endless message of the film yes its a good message but a good message doesnt make up for a bad film as i quoted skip this and see ever after is was so much better at telling the cinderella storynegative,film adaptations of beloved tv shows are a dime a dozen and it is not hard to determine the diamonds the untouchables the fugitive charlies angels from the lumps of coal pretty much everything else given that brian depalma is the guiding force behind the untouchables and the very structure of the tv show mission impossible opens many avenues that one could explore with a large budget a talented cast and the big screen one certainly can be forgiven for keeping an open mind unfortunately the end result is roughly 12 large scale action sequences surrounded by pure tedium there is a lot of blame to go around for the end result which burned up the box office and inspired two sequels so far but rarely if ever gets a mention on anyones lists of favorite summer blockbusters first the storyline and characters are thoroughly uninteresting for some reason known only to the screenwriters the focal character is someone completely new while the jim phelps character who led the tv series is shunted into support the film allows absolutely no time to get a feel for the imf team and how they work as our initial introduction to them is during a mission that turns into a disaster leaving the majority of the team dead due to an obvious traitor naturally the powers that be assume the traitor is the lone survivor tom cruise but we subsequently learn that another team member survived the melee emmanuelle beart so the two go on the run to steal a list of covert agents from the government to draw out a spy kingpin who they hope will force the hand of the traitor and expose himher or some such thing like the tv show there are a few twists and turns doublecrosses and reversals unlike the tv show none of them are particularly surprising or involving the cast looks better on paper than its plays out on screen kristin scottthomas and emilio estevez are in the film for barely more than an eye blink before being dispatched lead cruise is certainly up to the physical challenges of the role but gives us no good reason to root for his character he spends much of the film either blankfaced or glowering beart as his cohort and potential love interest is lovely but listless jon voight takes on the jim phelps role and pretty much contributes the same dull autopilot performance that he has reserved for his roles in popular entertainment for the last 20 years jean reno is wasted as a later addition to cruises team while ving rhames gets fed what few good lines there are and attempts to appear intimidating henry czerny trots out a slightly starchier version of the uptight government official that he played in clear and present danger meanwhile more discerning viewers wait for the fartoobrief appearances of vanessa redgrave who manages without breaking a sweat to make her fellow cast members appear laughable by comparison depalma once known for some incredible set pieces provides the film with stillborn pacing he ratchets up the adrenaline in the final act in and on top of a speeding train but prior to that we get one mildly amusing set piece with cruise attempting a theft while suspended above the floor in a government building unfortunately the scene goes on and on and on and on ultimately losing whatever suspense and originality it may have initially possessed these elements all culminate in a promising concept that misses its potentialnegative,even though this movie had plenty of expensive glitter an excess of onscreen whispering coupled with an excess of flashbacks rendered the plot next to impossible to figure out but then again maybe that was the producers point to get us to return again and again until we have it all sorted out therefore i also give it 1 pointnegative,even though it suppose to be based on the 1966 tv series anyone who has followed or really liked the television show will be disappointed because it doesnt have 4 guys but 1 as though the creators of this movie version has decided to interwine james bond solo idea into it so all you see throughout the movie is tom cruise being in the highlighted so much that you get the impression that maybe they should of made top gun 1996 movie instead i dont like when movie creators dont honor and adhere to original tv or movie concepts as it seems spitefully disrespectful as if they are saying i have a better idea i wont see anymore mission impossible movies as a result of this its like the green hornet 2011 movie that ruins a good concept by hijacking it totally somewhere elsenegative,england is alternate universe america no further proof than this movie the kingspeople british people dress like americans they just talk funny and use a class system this movie is about the british class system and how even poor people are worthy to become pawns in some meaningless struggle between global economies also a lady offers analsex as an incentive for her rescue from imprisonment cause thats what women so often do in real life there are so many other choices to offer than anal sex right off the bat a handjob a blowjob just regular old vaginal sex when did vaginal sex become not good enough? is this a new thing? i mean you are just giving away the keys to the kingdom to like the first dude that comes along does that sound prudent to you? more entertaining than the following movies sleepers divine secrets of the yaya sisterhood for the love of the game chicagonegative,ego centered and senseless movie brian depalma pulls off one cool scene involving an exploding restaurant otherwise a box office success that will be baffling to people who watch it once the tom cruise star has faded if you love tom and he can deserve your love just doesnt this time youll like the fact that for a team movie there is no team its all just tom thats fine if you dont remember the original concept of the cool tv show and lets face it the makers of the film were betting you dont best moment however is when they briefly play the original theme music in a couple of spots dangling wire scene is a steal fro topkakiwhich for depalma is a signature moment what can you say about a career that has lasted for decades where his signature is stealing other directors signature moments here though he really gets to do very little he certainly was taking the job hoping and getting a hit film so he could go off to make his more personal hitchcock rip off films  dont get me stated anyway he doesnt get to work much style into mission final sequence on the train in the tunnel is the first of many abusive unconvincing cgi action scenes that have followed and dominated american movie making i dont mean to get on a soapbox here this film is bad as a stand alone without trying to blame it for other bad films cruise is too into being serious to enjoy the film and the script written and rewritten while they were shooting doesnt not hold together leaving cruise looking rather silly for playing it so seriously rather than with a isnt this fun? dont take it too seriously attitude that might have saved at least him the film was a hit feel free not to listen to me or feel free to actually watch this film as a film and see how poor it is for those who see brian depalmas cinematic stealings from other films as being his expression of style this time around he most effectively steals the hanging on wires gag from topkaki unfortunately he needed to steal some scenes from about 10 other good movies to help out the rest of this one most exciting moment in the film is when they briefly play the original theme musicthat moment leads into the topkaki riff if you were on a desert island and only had this film and its sequel to watch id say watch this one otherwise use them both to burn to make black smoke to attract rescuenegative,dr will caster johnny depp develops a sentient computer device with unsurpassed processing power when fatally poisoned by a radical technoterrorist organisation he and his wife rebecca hall upload his consciousness into his invention to preserve his life but the now unrestrained supercomputer soon develops a frightening ambition that blurs the line between humanity and technology it seems that every few years somebody in hollywood tries to redo the lawnmower man which is by no means a perfect movie especially with its laughable early generation cgi but it harbours an interesting premise what happens if we ignore our own judgement and let our technology get the better of us? its an old scifi trope going back decades that has definitely become a crutch of story telling to some extent but any good idea is worth exploring again and with such an impressive cast and a very promising production team behind it hopes were high for transcendence to be a good movie unfortunately though it isnt transcendence is a turgid lifeless bore of a film that doesnt really offer anything insightful about its subject matter because its so single mindedly stupid about it all the parts about technology philosophy and what it means to be human are all thrown to the wayside and the movie instead grounds most of its logic on the relationship between two people like its the most important thing in this world in a movie where technology is used to heal the sick rebuild the forests and even cure death all the movie wants us to care about is how rebecca hall cannot possibly go on living without her dead husband and how all that amazing wonderful miraclemaking doesnt mean anything im not even sure who the main character is supposed to be depp is in the movie in the flesh only for about 15 minutes and after that he disappears mostly into the background of scenes as a computer program making it hard to relate to him hall acts so selfish stupid and blunt throughout that its impossible to like her as an audience member it certainly isnt paul bettany either hes a prisoner through most of the film and when hes not the things that are happening are more or less out of his control also the vagueness of the films antagonist is a real problem were led to believe that computeriseddepp is the main antagonist but hes not really a computer operating by logic is hard to hate as a viewer because its just doing whats in its own nature and many of the miracles its capable of are not in and of themselves evil either since when was healing the blind considered unjust? it certainly isnt the technoterrorist group rift either their motivations as terrorists isnt even particularly clear other than technology is bad shooting johnny depp over a hypothesis seems more like stupidity than martyrdom also during the films climax they become good guys johnny depp was reportedly paid $20 million for his role in this movie and in my opinion he didnt earn his salary he is stiff lifeless bored thats even before he gets uploaded into a computer and obviously uninterested in the finished product rebecca hall is trying very hard here but the terrible writing of her character hamstring her efforts paul bettany is good here and is probably the films strongest asset but hes not in the film enough and pretty much useless by the time the conclusion comes morgan freeman and cillian murphy are just there they dont really have anything interesting to say or do kate mara gives by far the worst performance the bad writing of her character hurts her more than others but she was impossible to buy as the stern serious leader of an organised terrorist group theres also a huge lack of understanding of rudimentary film making skills at play wally pfister is a gifted cinematographer and the film does look good generally speaking but working cinematography on a movie and directing an entire movie are two completely different ball games many aspects of filmmaking are botched here framing blocking dynamics between characters editing camera movements but especially pacing this is one of the worst paced movies in quite some time nothing that happens in the story has any momentum and this coupled with the poor direction over everything else makes the whole movie completely dull to watch the biggest mistake is that film begins with the ending spoiling any and all tension during the movie im not saying that every movie needs to have an action scene either there isnt a car chase during 12 angry men but transcendence builds to a huge final engagement and when it comes its over with way too quickly its a combination of many elements that could go wrong with a movie and its easy to blame wally pfister for the poor direction but i think this movie represents a far bigger concern johnny depp is currently the highest paid actor in the world but this and some of his last films the lone ranger and dark shadows both had disappointing box office takings which leads me to believe that maybe depps day are numbered andor perhaps were entering a new age of movies where it doesnt matter who you cast a stinkers a stinker and people wont flock to see garbagenegative,dont waste your time watching this film every interesting idea about the movie is thrown out the window half way through i found fascinating the parallel story thats being told between the main character and his daughter at some point nolan no longer cares for this so he decides to use time however he pleases the film is a huge contradiction and the way it is solved is just confusing and pretending to be more complex than it actually is they are on a mission thats more important than any personal issue man kinds future depends solely on the success of it but f©k that in this kind of hollywood bullshit protagonists cant die just because test audiences dont like that it makes them really really sad so against all odds mcconaughey makes it back home hooray for him and for all the idiots who need this kind of ending mark my words by the time matt damon appears you will be compelled to kick christopher nolan right in the balls i read that they were advised by physicist in order to be scientifically accurate im sure every accurate idea came from other films like 2001 event horizon etc interstellar is a cash grab if you spent your money on this be sure to check on your butt hole christopher nolan might have already had his way with you my asshole is intact because i torrented this bad boy suck on that film industrynegative,dont waste your time

predictable it just makes no sense i will never ever trust the ratings again ha first hour of the film is so stupid that it is funny faces that actors make unprofessional acting make the movie very very boring what else can i say i wish i stayed home with my husband ben affleck acts like it is his first movie he looks lost looks like he almost forgets the words family members also look and act like people that were taken from the street occasionally all that people look like they have no idea what is the film about im trying to understand how could this goofy movie get those ratings and i guess the answer is money because this is really really low levelnegative,dont waste your money too long wanders too much  c script with b actor i felt like i aged 50 years watching this garbage now i know why matthew is doing lincoln commercials he screwed up so many movies and this is what is left his only other worse movie was dumb oops i mean mud  what is this guy thinking whoever wrote this script must have been higher than robert plant in the 70s i cant believe matt damon jumped in probably for beer money matt datmon was the only one worth watching wait until someone hands you the dvd for your library otherwise dont spend a dime on this junk michael caine was in it for the beer money as wellnegative,dont waste any of your precious time watching this terrible boring and dull film the acting was simply harrowing to watch anne hathaway was as always akin to balsa wood and completely implausible the woman just cant act the film rumbles along for an hour before anything happens by which time you dont really care and you are probably very bored the plot and i use the term loosely is ridiculous and there is more tension in a broken elastic band by watching this i feel like i traded brain cells for jellybeans i must comment on the special effects which i was led to believe were good they were not the script has more holes than a sieve especially when it comes to the scientific theories related to space travel please please dont watch this trashnegative,dont fool yourself its just bad dont watch it you may thank me for this advice i wanted to keep this comment short because i dont want to spend more time of my life for this movie almost three hours was enough on the other side the movie made me feel better about myself in some way i mean some people spent 12 years making this what a waste this was refreshing because they lost more of their life than me this long production time doesnt show itself in the quality i had some feeling that the cinematographers wanted to work against quality they used the style of bad propaganda movies typical suburban shots where you expect that someone jumps out of a bush selling m*th to the children of course it would be explained too why it is bad like everything else in this movie they put the words in your mouth leaving nothing for the imagination i dont even mention that the main character is not special at all even more boring than an average person oh and he makes bad quality photos too in this bad quality movie living the life of an artist in a movie which never heard of art and he leaves his picture in the developer for waaay to long listening to the schematic monologue of his teacher instead you will find all kinds of schemes and clichs in this piece of modern film history as they call it in this movie which doesnt dare to state anything the whole movie was like a 3 hours long idk showing alcohol like a gateway to becoming whitetrash is promarijuana i guess but only daring to show it for a split of a second i watched every second of this movie just to see how are they going to come out of this pit? with a highly unrealistic chick acting like a dateraper sitting with our high placebomescaline main character in the sunset repeating the concept of this film i dont knownegative,dont fool yourself its just bad dont watch it you may thank me for this advice i wanted to

high placebomescaline main character in the sunset repeating the concept of this film i dont knownegative,does highly paid cast means good movie? the high rating of this movie represents the biased minds of reviewers towards famous cast it certainly does not deserve 72 rating twilight series which i really hated was better than this this movie is a piece of epic failure and is undoubtedly one of worst movies of this years to date there was no such thing even close to what we call good acting the movie was unable to develop any interest during whole of its running time i kept guessing there might be some twist or action coming up because of the high ratings but i was left with an anger that i wasted my time it is clear to me now that angelina jolie lacks voice talent she does not have any face expressions and most of her movies are overrated 2 stars for a slightly better graphics movie lovers avoid it not recommended to anybodynegative,do not believe the reviews this does not come close to an all time great movie i really question someone that gives this movie a good review its completely too long and filled with holes in noway does it come close to connecting any dots the only reason i went to see this movie is because of the 91 rating at the time but my first instinct was correct this movie is not worth watching ever maybe if they shaved 1 hour off but as is stay away after watching this movie i felt compelled to open an imdb account and review my first movie ever because of these reviews that are complete nonsensenegative,did i see the same movie that many other people gave a ten vote?? probably not the movie doesnt give any logic explanation to anything everything in the movie is treated in the most superficial possible way to not get completely disappointed all through the movie you would need to switch off your brain completely otherwise you wont get any answers to the questions that necessarily come to your mind also great actors like matthew mcconaughey are acting awfully probably realizing they are acting in a dumb movie all the director is trying to do is excite the audience with the soundtrack and special effects probably realizing himself how poor the plot is how could so many good actors accept to work in such a poor movie? and how come so many critics are writing that this is a great movie? i would really like to know what great directors like scorsese di palma herzog spielberg would think about this movie in two words absolutely disappointingnegative,despite the hype i went to see interstellar hoping for the best from the dreadful opening which went on forever featuring insipid dialogue and portentous acting by all involved to the crude miniatures in space clearly an homage to kubricks 2001 a space odyssey which accomplished far more with far less technical advantages than todays filmmakers the movie incredibly got worse and worse until the last 30 minutes with some inspired redemptive spacetime scenes but oh that insipid dialogue and mcconaughys western drawl and baleful looks echoed by a truly wasted anne hathaway who also walked through her lines the real culprit is the editing as if nolan was so in love with his work he could not bear to cut a scene and the music? so banal that it managed to be predictable and intrusive at the same time i couldnt wait for the space scenes to begin but from liftoff to deep space they could have nasa footage instead i just cant imagine how anyone could call the space scenes thrilling or the twists and turns of the plot gripping whether or not you liked gravity at least its space scenes were in your face and hardedged watching the interstellar space station cartwheel through space like a miniature toy out of a cracker jacks box was simply embarrassing the scene of mcconaughy and hathaway begging mat damon not to activate the airlock because it wasnt sealed was just another example of nolan trying to manufacture excitement instead of being a hoped for surprise the result was not only something we have seen in many scifi space movies but as an experienced astronaut and pilot damons character would absolutely know would happen there were so many wooden moments its hard to count the best was when mcconaughy walks into his sisters hospital room and the reaction from her friends and family is absolutely zero not even a cocked head what a colossal waste of time talent and money to create something so utterly unforgettable you just cant create a profound movie by hoping characters can talk their way through it nolan may have had a good story in his head but what a messconfused poorly plotted no editing and a visual treatment and color palette that looks like it was done by amateurs 1 out of 10 and thats being kindnegative,despite as far as i recall the first movie being pretty good insurgent just betrays everything that happened at the end with an unsatisfying explanation of why the villain is still in power the movie contains plot twists that a five year old could have predicted and is generally lackluster in its dialog with a weak plot boring characters and a total disregard for all character development from the first movie this was an extreme disappointment for me i will admit there were some good scenes but a diamond smothered in cow manure isnt very attractive the bottom line is that i didnt connect with any of the characters i dont know if this is the case but it seemed like they were trying to fit a lot of things from the book in that didnt belong the plot jumped all over the place without getting to know the characters in the plot or subplots i just got out of the movie and i can only remember three of the characters namesnegative,dear santa could you please please please arrange to make it possible that i never have to sit through another execrable pile of utter garbage that has become the standard level of effluvium nolan seems to regularly pitch out all dressed up in its sparkly emperors new clothes? memento was astonishingly brilliant on a budget of several shillings insomnia likewise batman begins was a welcome reinvigoration of a franchise which had previously become something to ridicule and then came the seriously big budgets which exponentially reduced the credibility of any plot or story and here we are at a new cinematic low which worryingly garners this level of praise presumably because it has big special effects empty shallow bombastic unengaging risible crap ohand a new train set would be tops thanksnegative,convoluted dialogue wooden performances and a surprise to see zoe saldana and particularly glenn close in such dross i can only surmise they needed the moneyno character development to speak of except for that of the raccoon that cgid fellow actually showed more acting chops and skill than any of the human cast im a huge fan of marvel and its always a shame to see a thing done badly there was no energy the pace was laboured staggered it just lacked rhythm as a side note the rating this film has received is a travesty i must assume people are not watching movies they are rating i understand everyones tastes are different but really 8 stars i wouldnt by the dvd wait until it hits terrestrial if you must see it but definitely dont pay good money to view this filmnegative,cons i hated how the actor for cinderella looked her eyebrows bothered me throughout the whole movieshe wasnt a true blond had a fat jaw small eyes larger nose and bluntly just not gorgeous cinderella was supposed to be pretty

etcwith added clockwork orange violence simply shows that matthew vaughn is just another vile tarantino wannabee handed a big budget and excessively indulgently produced a stupid film with set pieces of boring ugly violence some scenes as in the church are just disgusting and from that point the interest level wanes the scenes in the mountain lair are inception meets on her majestys secret service with absurd and endless killing which ultimately made me feel ill 30 minutes too long and from a clown copycat director this film is great initially for 60 minutes and then irritating and vile for 70 minutes yes the damn thing runs 130 minutes i really did feel sick and exhausted when it finished i thought it all a shocking waste of production money time and the studios trust to show contempt for the audience with such cretinous perverse action and result the villain even spews on the audience then there is the hilarious anal sex joke the last 70 minutes of this chrome dildo of a movie are truly horriblenegative,cinema visitors seeing the good rating and reviews on imdb beware i am a big fan of fantasy movies but first of all the 16+ rating is not truly understandable for me its a children and family movie and so i have to confess i may be to hard on the movie because i went in there with to high expectations the look may be good and the vfx are also high quality production but the story just lacks on depth the idea to show the beginning of evil and the fairy tale world from another point of view is good but the script and the acting was really bad imo angelina could have done better and some very flat character drawings and dialogs let me roll my eyes unconsciously the movie had some funny moments though but they are rare and for this idea there should have been more time for preproduction sometimes and most of all in the beginning it seems like a fastforward story where every important story point is just streaked with the cautiousness of a metal glove its what i would call a sunday afternoon movie where you can lay on the couch and just let it pass but its nothing what really attracted me for my 3 female friends it was entertaining but they also told me that it was nothing special and they would not really recommend it to other friends they just described it as a nice if there are no expectations and you want to make your 4 to 12 year old child happy with a nice movie you should sit in there seeing angelina in the role was interesting but now i know its not her kind of genrenegative,cinderella is the worst movie and a clich_ remake by walt disney studios are walt disney so desperate to rip off and copy all cinderella movie scenes and to make a very bad copy i saw the previous cinderella movies especially the original cinderella movie they were too much better and well done than this stolen and pirated copy movie why would the producers of walt disney studios make a very boring film which even kids might hate because of the absence of creativity to be honest and to tell the truth i regret seeing this film because it is only made for babies to fool them avoid this movie and watch the original first copy because it is superiorwhile this pirated and rip off movie is so inferior if not the worst movie ever madenegative,cinderella is the worst movie and a clich remake by walt disney studios are walt disney so desperate to rip off

regret seeing this film because it is only made for babies to fool them avoid this movie and watch the original first copy because it is superiorwhile this pirated and rip off movie is so inferior if not the worst movie ever madenegative,childish presentation boring in parts very silly overall noisy irritating soundtrack unnecessarily long scenes strange direction techniques very few real thrills a lot of hype  and i never realized what an enormous nose tom cruise has maybe thats why one of the female leads also has a giant schnozzle the film was a gross disappointment though i guess diehard cruise fans will eat it up any comparison between this effort and the tv series is virtually pointless as the tv shows were fast exciting clever superblydirected full of suspense with a lot of sharp dialogue and actors who were true craftsmen sorry but this flick is a real bummernegative,can i have the 25 hours of my life back? there is no closure to this movie they ruined it with the ending imho what were the producers and directors thinking a long and very drawn out movie and then to get to the end and leaving the audience hanging it reminds me of one the lord of the rings movies where they just suddenly and abruptly end the movie except this one is much worse since there will be no sequel my wife and i had a debate whether the wife was attractive or not i thought so at the beginning of the movie and not so much later my wife thought that she was not attractive at all i hope this review is beneficial and will save someone time and moneynegative,brian de palma has just ruined the originality of mission impossible jim phelps a traitor? seriously tom cruise is destroying one of the greatest imf secret agents now tell me jim has been a wonderful successful spy and a real handsome one at that and youre going to tell me a dumbass like ethan hunttom cruise is going to trick him? someone is trying to kill off the original mission feeling and replacing it with thick hollywood effects lightweight conceited actors like tom cruise and girls with fake boobs too reminiscent of james bond or any other typical hollywood wannabe spy film im so glad peter graves and most of the original actors didnt get themselves involved with this depressing movie the movie desperately tried to replace the characters with new ones but i dont think you can ever replace jim phelps with tom loser cruise or barney or paris or anybody i never liked tom cruise anyways the original tv shows were much better than these new movies vasically because they were intricately plotted had lots of wit and barely had these huge unnecessary explosion scenes which the new movies have so much of i think the only reason why this new piece of crap remake of mission impossible was made by idiots for idiots if you have watched the old 1960s mission impossible and liked it you may not like these movie remakes they are nothing compared to the intellect and intricate planning of the original and if youre a jim phelpspeter graves addict like me youll hate the movie even morenegative,boyhood this is richard linklaters much talked about film that was actually shot over the course of twelve years chronicling the growth of his characters now let me get something straight before i proceed my reviews are always based upon the finished product what is presented on screen i dont concern myself with what happened behind the scenes what got left on the cutting room floor or how the film was made i concern myself with the balance of style substance and execution now with that in mind let i remind you that this is a work of fiction written by linklater himself not a documentary chronicling the growth of actual people but rather the growth of the characters he wrote had this been a documentary i might have allowed myself to be blindsided just a bit in which manner the film was made but its not a documentary so i will completely disregard the manner in which the film was made that sort of thing does not play a part in my review so what do we have left? honestly not that much two hours and forty five minutes of filler lightly sprinkled with brief moments of conflict with no resolution therefore no character growth i mean this is a film about boyhood or at least one can assume that much given the films title but i will go on a little further to say this is a film chronicling a boys ascension into manhood a lot can happen during that time in fact a lot does happen during that period in ones life which all goes into the molding of the person who you will eventually be unfortunately it seems that were just outsiders looking in youd think that a film about one of the most tumultuous times in ones life would be a roller coaster ride of emotions but what we have is a film thats nearly three hours long devoid of any emotions no life lessons learned by the main characters no emotional growth period what the hell did i just watch? if the characters didnt learn anything then they didnt grow emotionally if they didnt grow emotionally then i have a hard time connecting to the characters on an emotional level sure we can all relate to adolescence but dont let that fool you into thinking that you know these particular characters know why they are the way they are know what drives and motivates their actions and behavior by the end of the film ive watched these human beings grow up physically rather than to grow into beings of consciousness and emotions that make them humannegative,boyhood is truly an amazing film terrible awkward cringeinducing dialogue boring uninspired cinematografy awful poorly written characters no story to keep you interested also dont forget that the movies really long too it almost feels twice the 12 years lets be serious here they are saying the movies revolutionary it took twelve years to make but if you think about it harry potter franchise is same kind of thing as this film except with actual characters and plot but really some people dare to call this movie a masterpiece? hmm i think i will release my childhood movies they were recorded in span of 12 years im pretty sure ill get an oscar in the conclusion spare yourself your sanity and dont watch this film im pretty sure that once you get outside of the cinema you will feel 12 years older i got gray because of that movienegative,boring boring boring boring i wish i could fill up this review with just that one word but imdb wont let me how can anyone sit through 2 34 hours of watching someones boring life roll by? what a waste of film  or is it all video tape now? i dont care how long a film took to make how the actors aged over the course of the film or anything else i want a film to tell a story and this is more like watching someones boring life as they grow up so what? who wants to watch that? what is it with all these people who think that is marvelous they really must have incredibly boring lives to think that this film is even the remotest bit interesting this film is almost as bad as birdman which i watched completely thinking that at some point something interesting must happen but it didnt just some artyfarty long camera shots whoopdeedoo and this one was filmed over 12 years? whoopdeedoonegative,better than woos sterile sequel but has the unmistakable stamp of de palmas illogic except this time it isnt so much illogic as total confusion for the viewer the plot twists and the conspiracy haze go quite far and it isnt long after one gives up in trying to understand who is doing what to whom for what reason the movie isnt boring ill give it that de palmas films are rarely boring however there is also a casting problem rhames  of all people  plays a computer expert a hacker no less this is absolutely ridiculous then we have the old and nearly fat jon voight karatechopping the young james bondtype tom cruise character even more absurd voights wife is emmanuelle beart these two are as convincing a pair as bob dole and britney spears would be the action sequences with the helicopter are wooesquire cruise blows up the chopper and the explosion throws him  unharmed  onto the train which is going at around 200 kmh and then a part of the chopper fails to impale him by a mere millimeter these scenes were truly prophetic because woo  the king of absurdist action scenes  took over in the sequel beart comes complete with a set of fake breasts and an upper lip so pumped up with silicone or whatever it is they inject there that her mouth is perpetually pursed to kiss someonenegative,being a fan of disneys 1959 sleeping beauty i was excited for maleficent one of disneys most iconic villains to be brought to life in live action however after seeing the film i am utterly disappointedin the film maleficent the classic story of sleeping beauty is butchered the film by itself is not a bad film the visuals are great and angelina jolie actually resembles maleficent this film though ignores the already established tale of sleeping beauty and makes up a new one while watching this film i was pleased with the initial backstory created for maleficenthowever this backstory pins stefan as the actual villain and maleficent as the a victimin this backstory stefan removes maleficents wings in order to be the next king this change was one i was at first willing to tolerate however maleficent interacts with aurora from the time that she is a newborn all the way up to her teens maleficent becomes so close with aurora that aurora begins to call her a fairy godmother this destroys maleficents character maleficent is supposed to be cruel and evil but this film makes her out to be a loving motherly figure things only get worse from there prince phillip is a practically useless character in this film he appears to be a naive and unintelligent teenager instead of the powerful prince he is supposed to be then adding to the uselessness of phillips character when aurora is in her deathlike sleep phillips kiss does not wake her up it is maleficents kiss that wakes her up i find this change to be completely unacceptable maleificent is supposed to hate aurora and phillip is supposed to fight epically to save aurora then once aurora is awake again she teams up with maleficent to escape from stefans castle in doing so aurora finds maleficents wings which are still flapping she gives them to maleficent who basically becomes indestructible this sequence is so departed from the sleeping beauty story that it seems like it contains all new characters instead of the already established maleficent an aurora my biggest complaint is about the dragon maleficent does not turn into a dragon there is a dragon but it is not maleficent and it is easily overpowered by stefans soldiers phillip is not involved with he dragon at all the dragon in the 1959 sleeping beauty is one of the most iconic scenes in all of disney history and the fact that they removed that scene is appalling to me maleficent completely ignores the context set by sleeping beauty and twists it into a lesser versionnegative,because of all the positive hype i hoped for at least a good film im left wondering what it is i just dont get so many good reviews? even mark kermode says the young actor in the film has screen presence and i think wtf hes playing a boring so and so  hes not supposed to have presence im not sure if theres enough good stuff here even for 10 minutes  seriously certain things like ethan hawk showing an empty wallet caught my empathy for a moment but not enough to merit sitting through nearly 3 hours of this i just dont understand how it won the golden globe for best film thankfully theres a few negative reviews from likeminded people for me to know ive not gone completely madnegative,basically this film was a cross between 2001 a space odyssey and gravity there wasnt that much to it the one saving grace was nolans inspired depiction of a 5 dimensional space very neat shame about the flimsy plot dodgy character development and poor script oh yes and the clunky ridiculous robots were fun all in all a waste of money nolan should have made a much simpler film something foreign and arty to stick his cool 5 dimensional bookshelf into the rest of the cash he spent on this would probably have done some good somewhere but such is life silly spoiled directors and their silly spoiled foolish vanity trips boringnegative,avoid this couple at all costs  they are very toxic gone girl is a misleading title since amy is not a girl she used to be a childhood storybook celebrity named amy but there is nothing girlish like about her in this movie in fact she calls herself the cword david fincher has made some of my favorite movies fight club zodiac etc but this is not one of my favorites this movie is all the things i dislike in a movie  tedious depressing unlikeable characters dark photography moody music strange casting smug dialogue this might work with the girl with the dragon tattoo but come to think of it  that was no girl eithernegative,at the time of watching this movie it had a rating of 84 on imdb i normally trust that whatever movie has an 80 rate or more should definitely be a great film well i hope this is the exception that confirms the rule because this movie might be one of the worst i have ever seen why? you must be wondering because of the last 30 minutes up until that point i was really enjoying it generally speaking but man that ending is appalling utterly atrocious and plainly nonsensical a great thriller turned into a love story of pathetic proportions in a matter of minutes the only positive i found at the end was the way they portray the power of media and public opinion in society the rest should go down the garbage shoot in these types of movies theres only one premise keep it real if you do youll have a great film which will improve with every twist and turn you add if you dont keep it real and your thriller becomes too surrealistic youll find yourself going from cleverness and brilliance to false cleverness and stupidity and thats exactly what happened in this film in the last half hour seriously who in their right mind can believe that sequence of events at the end? it had great potential but it is surely one that i will remember for the wrong reasonsnegative,at first i thought this movie is a parody of all the other superhero nerdy clichs and i kept waiting for something funny to happen at some point i started to realize that this movie is for real for real boy meets girl and after trying to kill each other they fall in love the bad guys must work together in order to save the world therefore becoming the good guys they of course defeat the evil all their criminal past is erased they get the universes recognition yada yada yada everyone lives happily ever after this movie couldnt even make me smile terrible acting no emotion no sparkle no nothing if i could i would rate this movie zero starsnegative,at first i thought this movie is a parody of all the other superhero nerdy clich_s and i kept waiting for something funny

movie couldnt even make me smile terrible acting no emotion no sparkle no nothing if i could i would rate this movie zero starsnegative,at first i thought i was in a horror movie or a lame lord of the rings type rip off but then this lame movie turned out to be a save the planet preachy flick i give this three stars maimly because of my favorite actress is in it and as always does a great job and that would be imelda staunton other than this i would rate this movie but one star i was looking forward to a fresh interpretation of the bible story instead was treated to this i like well told stories but this should have been returned to the writer and put the money to better use sorry mrs pitt it at least appeared the you were trying thanks but i will not rent this one and waste more money the producers spent a fortune on this and they will get their money back before its all over but they should look at disney classics and even movies that have been churned out after disneys demise at a fraction of the cost and have been very successful from toy story miniseries to the lion king remake there is a strong interest in genuine faith based movies there was nothing genuine about this just empty meaningless hollywood hypenegative,as you can probably ascertain from my title sentence i am not a fan of mr nolan however i dont have any bias prior to watching his films in fact quite the opposite i want to like his films as i really like his ideas and concepts which is why its such a shame he never delivers i also seem to be in a minority with my views as his films seem to have mass appeal certainly if you look at money they make but so far they have all left me cold interstellar tdk and inception all have similar flaws on the positive side they are all really cinematic stylish and well filmed they all have really atmospheric music and nice special effects on the negative side the plots are terrible and make no sense the dialog is flat and unrealistic there is no charisma or charm in the films they are functional and soulless and they lack any real depth or meaning the characters tend to be robotic and cold not warm or humorous the problem is when you put these two elements together you basically get high expectations that something great is going to happen but ultimately nothing does so it becomes a major let down on to interstellar specifically warning spoilers a plenty the first hour of the film was very boring and very silly the earth is running out of food so people still plant huge fields of crops which they destroy when driving through them for no good reason they have completely automated the process of farming crops yet they dont need scientists or engineers they need farmers which makes no sense if the earth was starving then the crop fields would be fenced off taken away from farmers and it would be a controlled process scientists and engineers would be the most valued members of society if the crops were so valuable they wouldnt be exposed to the elements and the dust they would be covered and protected everyone is so worried about the food shortages they dont take any notice of it instead they drive around in huge petrol driven suvs from 2014 wheres the google cars or electric cars? heres an idea you now have the ability to hibernate on spaceships so apply that to the population of earth and reduce the need for food anyway lets move on they go into space arrive at some place and immediately land in some water do they survey the area first check out the planet and landing area first in detail nope they just land now i know there is time pressure but why havent nasa sent numerous robots into space to visit these planets and send back information anyway this drags on a bit they visit another place which is another disaster and then we get to the point of the film only after about 2 and a half hours cooper flies into a black hole where he would normally be crushed and killed instantly but survives in some kind of advanced framework where he very predictably sends the already sent messages back to his daughter after this there is a very silly ending even though he is outside of time as it were and he can send messages to any point he cant for some reason stay in the same time as his daughter and how stupid was the 1970s minecraft designed robot in the end the visuals and atmospheric music was great but the plot soul and charm of the film was completely missing unfortunately like all nolan moviesnegative,as you can figure from the summary i am here to bring the rate down because 82 star as i review this was not justified this movie the story revolves around mason for 12 years of his life and as everybody said this movie is using the same cast filming for 12 years i understand the value of this signature but let me remind you this is not a documentary or a story based on true event it is fictional so first priority must come to writing and boy the writing is awful they managed to make a story less interesting than a 12 years story of any regular boys out there mason changing school meeting new friends abused by his step father got a girlfriend morph to an emo he got into photography what could be more mainstream than that? mason have no depth have no motivation mason is a loser with no direction of life and still not projecting any compassion to his mother some drama make you laugh some make you cry some make you think deep about life some make you want to hug your loved one boyhood does not do any of that 82 rating is a trap only movie hipster critics rate this movie high because of the art and gimmick so if you are a normal person who wants a good story and a good time dont watch this this movie is just 3 hours of watching a boy gradually lose his cuteness and acting skill *sorry for my bad englishnegative,as the title suggeststhis show is trying much to hard to live up to other titles in the dc universe the dark knight smallville and the also overrated man of steel it is too dark and gritty that it detracts from the overall narrative if the show were a bit more lightheartedthen maybe the arrow would character would be more tolerable as the show continues queens back story just seems more and more contrived and begins to lack purpose the abundance of the flashbacks per episode also gets to be distracting the only character on the show who isnt completely one directional is felicity she lights up any scene shes in and makes the show a bit brighter which i feel it needs more of however those are short lived and quickly dismissed by testosterone filled fight sequences that are difficult to see because again its too dark if the show stopped trying to take itself so seriously like a drama and more like a comic book series then it would a much better and enjoyable shownegative,as the summary tells you i found this show after seeing 11 episodes a big disappointment the main characters have absolutely no chemistry with each other and their acting is just terrible in general i found out that after a couple of episodes i thought there was something i missed in the intro he tells us he becomes something else now since i am not a big arrow fan or any comics in general i thought there must have happened something that changed him into something else like with the hulk but no at least not up to this point but more important is that there isnt any indication that they will reveal something like that has happened that is just one small example of how awful the storywriting is in my opinion a show must have got some credibility like in other shows and movies we tend to believe that they can do those extraordinary things but up now they have failed to let me believe anything perhaps it is due to the acting lack of chemistry or the thin storyline but i assume it is because all of those things together the only thing that is actually good about the show are the action scenes but since they failed to let me believe anything those arent good enough to carry the show all in all a terrible show and i dont expect any progress in the near futurenegative,as the movie started i was excited to see a character wearing a mask with glowing red eyes i thought the opening scene was promising and then suddenly some nonserious music started to play the main character started to dance and everything went downhill from there after that there was special effect after special effect i love special effects but it did sound like this movie was made only to showcase special effects such as explosions explosions explosions and did i forget to say explosions? the special effects were indeed magnificent but it doesnt take long for you to realize it is all eye candy it is there to help conceal the fact that this is a movie made for ten year old kids to gaze at and go wow for everyone else and by everyone else i mean adults with thinking brains this extremely shallow and childish piece of work would be little more than a showcasing of special effects and cinematic techniques surprise surprise special effects do not make up for a shallow childish and extremely disjointed plot with performances that range from mediocre to downright terrible and they do not make a movie worth a mature persons time i loved the ghost rider thor and the amazing spiderman 2 even the avengers was tolerable but this one was simply a mess designing lots of weird looking characters with unpleasant colors and hair styles is like desperately asking the audience to love the movie just because it has some of the most weird looking characters ever seen in a movie men in black anyone? one of my biggest complaints and what really annoyed me throughout the movie is that while the special effects were great the combination of colors in most of the scenes was really unpleasant remember how thor had great colors in each and every scene? the colors actually went with one another you dont see that here a combination of light blue orange brown grey and a lot of colors that create a really awful combination was present in nearly every scene it was a huge letdown next time they should get a better art director so that they do not annoy the people who understand colors and art in summary this movie is not for adults take your kids to see it though they will definitely love it but since spending so much money only to entertain kids is not really justifiable theyd better stop wasting such huge amounts of money on movies like this and spend it where its really needed fighting ebola to save the human race would be a much better use of such a huge amount of moneynegative,as many have said it is the uneventual life of a person much like the truman show which made fun on the reality tv this basically wants to be the truman show obviously this doesnt really work because you see his 12 years in the 3 hours if they made a tv show about the main character it would have most likely never lasted 12 years but then again people watch all kind of reality tv for me it did nothing and i stopped watching after the first 20 or so minutes and just skipped through until the end people called it life great but i rather watch the goldbergs for that at least it is funny and funny enough being a child of the 80s i can relate to itnegative,as almost an oldtimer having enjoyed the original tv series i rushed to the theater to remember some of the old feeling flawed casting an unbalanced script hesitating acting and overthetop special effects made me grind my teeth in anger and close my eyes tight shut in shame the plot the effects the relations the triple treason etc all have a distinct smell of the improbable it has several moments you feel like saying yeah right to the screen to indicate what you see is truly and utterly impossible and as always that kills the movie and thats sadnegative,as a fan of marvel movies i was excited to see guardians of the galaxy however this movie failed on several levels it is supposed to a comedy but the jokes are not funny i genuinely laughed once furthermore one joke was weirdly inappropriate the story is completely generic it seems like they just needed some story any story as a vehicle for the characters to get together and try to be funny i wanted to write a review without spoilers but the big setpiece ending of a spaceship crashing into the ground has to be called out this was done in the avengers and star trek into darkness to me its like directors have to have this 911 shot in every movie big thing crashes into buildings and it has to stop its boring now the only positive about this movie was the special effects and space backgrounds it seems that marvel have figured out punters will pay cash money for any old junk if its wrapped up in special effects and a decent soundtrack i will approach the next marvel with extreme caution and i will not see guardians of the galaxy 2negative,any one who read dc comics will tell you green arrow is a poor mans batman so to speak that being said with all the copywrite garbage i am sure it is easier to get rights to make a green arrow show rather than a new batman show this still doesnt excuse how horrible this thing is a friend referred it to me as a great show with the flash in it they dont cover the flash at all really just a short cameo with normal barry allen i would encourage you to watch a daytime soap opera then watch this garbage and tell me the difference the acting is horrible the writing is so awful that it must be done by drunken monkeys they randomly put a villain in the clock tower and arrows crew wonders where he is they should just move their headquarters there if they ask laural one more time is something wrong i will punch my tvnegative,and i dont think its me if you want to know specifically whats wrong with this flick look at some of the other 1* reviews its been spelled out in detail what i want to talk about is how this dumb movie has an 8* rating with over 200k people rating it the first thing that comes to mind is what i read about another new release the interview which had a high rating and lots of positive reviews within 24 hours of its release someone pointed out the statistical aberrations of those numbers suggesting imdb was getting bombarded by false accounts with an addenda to deceive for this movie i dont think thats the case so im wondering how so many people can be so uncritical in their thinking well about half the voters in the usa voted to reelect george w bush so that explains a lot for those of you who gave this movie high marks and didnt vote for bushs second term please consider this for the future there are movies where we are presented with a madeup reality from the start like time travel for example or unreal mental states like in tron or the matrix with those you say ok its bs now entertain me but when a movie takes place in the world we know and live in there is a higher standard as the story progresses it must be logical it cant defy gravity it cant do things that are not gunna happen in real life those are the holes in the story in gone girl there are so many holes and those holes are so ridiculous you gotta ask yourself do they think im stupid? i guess the answer is yes i guess they are correct i guess im now a minority the dumbing of america is happeningnegative,an 84 are you high? i always thought that there would be a good reason for a movie to last 2 and a half hours i dont see why so many girls my age 16 were so into it after watching gone girl i felt as if i had wasted so much time in which i couldve accomplished something and made myself more useful this movie was a waste of time it was boring long and totally ridiculous i dont see what is feminine about it since there are some totally disgusting scenes that i think some men couldnt bare to watch which of course had nothing to do with the plot fake rape was there really a need for it? was there a need in using seduction to kill your ex? couldnt you just kill him in his sleep? but no i had to be done in a sexual way to make to movie stand out more the sex scenes were totally outrageous disturbing and completely unrealistic and next time you make a movie try and reduce the amount of oral sex no one wants to see someone implying that are having oral sex i dont know what else to say but this movie is just really bad and it annoyed me because i was spending so much time desperate to see it because of the high rating and when i did i felt like i wasted so much time obsessing over nothing they couldve chosen better actors and actresses too i hope i never come across a movie that was this bad every again sorry but this movie was an epic failnegative,am i the only one on planet earth who thinks that this film is absolute tosh? perhaps im being unkind because i could only handle an hour before walking out i thought the acting in particular was very poor the storyline is twaddle  a farmer with flight experience finds nasa in an unspecified location with a rocket that is going to save earth  a typecast michael caine thank goodness it wasnt morgan freeman opens the boardroom door and there is the rocket it seemed to me that used actual rocket launch footage? the time element is misused and the special effects are not that great i thought elysium knocked socks off this film i did semi enjoy the water sequence but it was at the point where they get back to the mother ship that i walked  very quickly out of the cinema ps i love matthew mcconaughey in true detective and i cant believe i was looking at the same actornegative,although there was an impossible mission in this movie the story has nothing whatsoever to do with the classic tv series in the show a team of under cover specialists created an artificial situation for the benefit of the victims of a sting type operation usually resulting with their enemies turning on each other the imf team in this movie pretty much refers to tom cruise alone with the rest of the team reduced in status to nameless flunkies who just stand around and watch as he single handedly saves the world the tv shows covert stealth premise was tossed out since cruise doesnt emote well enough to convey the tension of committing espionage right under a dangerous enemys nose instead the original format was replaced by cranked up action at an impossible james bond on steroids level with scenes such as the exciting but ridiculously over the top helicoptertrain sequence other actors have woefully limited screen time but act their parts faithfully the original  from the show is utilized well spicing up the action effectively the script is shallow and the entire mole twist bit is concealed as well as is as an elephant hiding behind an ant its also an insanely stupid plot twist which spits on the tv series the impossible mission to make tom an action hero see a james bond flick or a rerun of the original tv series insteadnegative,alright odds are youre going to hate this because i didnt really like this movie and im fairly blunt sometimes my extremely detailed summary this is what i get for finally going into a movie blind thinking it has morgan freeman and depp and paul bettany in it so it has to be passable at least right? well the director was very awful and the story was ridiculous its a movie about the singularity and dealing with it and while there are some things in that id like to believe happen someday its not going to happen in this manner here we go basically depp is a brilliant weirdo and married to his soulmate wifeperson they work in genetic computing so depp gets shot by a psycho and is going to die so emotional wifeperson takes the next step and downloads depps brain into the pc system hes been developing and it works the psychos are attacking all over its calamity jim what can we do? we have to hide inside this totally undefended abandoned school from our childhood which happens to be housing this extra copy of the worlds most advanced computer set up system we need that anyone could have just walked up and used  super computer depp needs to be connected to the internet and does get connected for approximately 1 second and is now spreading himself over everything everywhere but it took days to download his brain?  super computer depp does shady stock works to make his wife rich and so then hes going to work towards fixing humanity in some method that computers believe is best so he needs a place to do this he decides and hes smarter than us so this has to be right that this place should be underground under a desert in california right beside this piece of crap hopeless hick town wife will use newfound riches to build it  this might be reasonable except wife hires one redneck hick from the town to build it  redneck hick is successful in a few seconds and *poof* we have this insanely gigantic underground facility full of technical equipment never before seen to man so it didnt actually take a few seconds but in actual movie time it was more like a month  deppbot starts healing people with nanobots and taking over their bodies making them super strong and super smart or restoring vision this seems fine except theyre now brainwashed into a nanozombie state  deppbot decides this is better for everyone starts recruiting more people for miracles  bettany is aware things arent good and teams up with the original psychos including a daenerys clone that shot depp to try and bring him down they hide under copper wire nets and eventually steal the original redneck hick since nanoprogrammed into a superzombie deppbot cant see through copper wire it blocks his wireless signal  bettany helped live depp program the original ai system hes the only one that can stop this  in a few seconds he comes up with a virus that can take down deppbot and injects it into the wife shes going to die but its going to be for the good of humanity  attack plan time the psycho team mounts an assault on depps field of solar energy panels to distract him while wifey goes and is like oh save me lover deppbot or something and gets him all secretly hell never see it coming  using four guys the fake mother of dragons three guns and a 1910 style mortar gun dragged around on by trailer hitch on an elderly chevy van they defeat the evil nanozombie townsfolk despite a large number of shading things happening  bettanys virus is uploaded to all the internets in the entire world infecting everything and shutting the internet off and turning it back to a prestone age state also known as 1986 after all its better than an army of depp clones that use wireless internet to steal people theyre nanobots you know theyre in everything now  humanity is saved yes ***big reveal*** i wont reveal it but what doesnt happen is depp isnt like screw your internet im gonna make my own internet to run my life he made his own new self out of synthetic flesh and whatnot he reincarnated himself as a living breathing deppbot but he apparently cant defeat the lack of 80111ac wireless i can assure you that that did not happen even though his nanobots are in everything moral of the story this movie is impressive in its illogical hilarity which is extremely difficult to describe or attempt to write down i didnt include most of it it might be worth it to watch and make fun of in a sort of count the number of times the wet bandits die in home alone sort of way but otherwise dont we got like 5 minutes of morgan freeman in this one apparently theres only so much morgan freeman to go around and some other movie needed an old black guy i hope you appreciated this summary but odds are youre bugged nownegative,after seeing this get a good rating i took at shot at watching itright now my faith in humanity has dropped a whole bunch if this is what they think is a good show so in fairness i figured to press on and go into season 2 to see if it was a context thing that would make it better only to find the show went from bad to omg brutally bad in season two how can one listen to a supposed superhero whine for hours on end and not want to throw a rock at the monitor? after a while my eyes glazed over and realized this show is missing a y chromosome really badly the acting is some of the worst ive seen in some time the script writers should be taken to the woodshed and the characters are as thin as one could ever imagine my wife had a great summary of this show she said it was like the green hornet had a child with one the kardashian sisters and gave birth to a green whiney superhero who needs acting lessons however the real villains in this show are the writers and most of the actors shows like this never get cancelled yet the really good one never get a second seasonnegative,after 30 minutes you are still not interested the 30 minute time frame is the cutoff for interest the lines in the movie are so idiotic that a three year old could have written them i think people that wrote good reviews actually were getting paid to do it my wife likes chic flics but this one is so stupid and the dialogue is so stupid that only an idiot could like it the scenes are ridiculous the police in the story are stupid and do not act like police the main character which happens to be ben aflec of should i say aflac is searching for clues that his wife left after she disappeared and how can i say how bad the script is it is for an emotional response from women men do yourself a favor and do not watchnegative,actually a good well acted movie till the end ben affleck was excellent and rosamund pike had me 100% convinced she was evil incarnate carrie coon as bens twin sister and kim dickens as the lead detective also gave excellent performances as for the story i can deal with sad endings where the hero dies like braveheart cool hand luke and endless others when the credits came up on gone girl i could only regret spending over 2 hrs to watch a movie that left me that angry i would have preferred she had just killed ben affleck and gotten away with it assuming the book had the same ending i would have thrown it across the room upon finishing it i enjoyed the movie up till the end but that completely ruined it for menegative,a typical nutsandbolts storyline that hollywood is sooooo comfortable with ye ole agent that has outlived his usefulness so its time to retire them permanently practice anyone who has followed the equalizer eye spy or the original series from which this film is based is certainly not unfamiliar with the plot add to this some nifty special effects and gadgetry and youve got a time worn plot with a new wrapping of course throw in the usual percentage of spy idioms too the team does a job then proceeds to get knocked off except for tom cruise toms out there and alone tom desperately tries to contact the company tom is scared tom forgot his dental floss see tom run tom cant even manage a goofy smile they try to kill tom toms having a bad hair day what happens for the rest of this flick is a whirlwind of incredible improbability and a seething lack of tension inbetween muffled protests of no way and the physical sense of my eyelids getting heavy mission impossible is about as suspenseful as watching a plumber unclog a drain ms redgraves performance is little more than a cameo which is a true waste of a gifted actress in summation when the best thing you can say about a motion picture is that the peppy theme song recycled from the tv series still sounds good its time to fold the tentnegative,a tired theme and plot nothing to see here overall the plot has a political agenda aimed at america in spite of the fake british accents ugly inglorious scenery abounds from the beginning dont take your children to see this movie or rent it renting the movie or paying to see it because it has angelina jolie in it is the same as having voted for obama because he was black great movies are cast with unknowns so predictable casting spells turning people into the proverbial newt royal birth and associated spell choir voices in spite of zero spirituality with associated special fx in the fairycolor spectrum the political slant is in the plot where maleficent defends the moors a biome in europe from humans i banish humans from the moors foevah she says the common belief today among the confused is that humans have ruined mother earth and do not belong here my daughters and i have watched nearly every disney movie in the last 20 years and this is the worstnegative,a simple farm guy named copper matthew mcconaughey and a few other experts go into outer space to explore other worlds that might sustain human life it seems that that life on earth might not survive due to to some unexplained environmental disaster naturally nothing goes right way overpraised and terrible scifi movie when i heard the plot from this i expected the worst writerdirector christopher nolan has never been a favorite for mei hate what he did to batman in his movie trilogy i thought that he as trying to imitate stanley kubrick 2001 here but its far worsehes doing steven spielberg the movie runs way too long 165 minutes and theyre constantly pushing family friendly values in your face coopers nonstop yammering about his daughter got on my nerves instantly also that stupid fake southern accent he adopts is immediately annoying the story is very slow and all the characters are cardboard cutouts youve seen in other movies the special effects are flawless and theres some beautiful cinematography here but the extreme length and boring story really weigh it down any sort of statement theyre trying to make on time and life is completely deadened by the script also this movie is very manipulative and way too sentimental they go out of their way to make the audience crylike at a spielberg movie well i did crytears of joy at the end that this was over also the gaps in logic and plot holes here are very annoying i lost track of how many times i rolled my eyes at the dubious logic served up here the acting was as good as it could be i guess but at the end they throw in a surprise guest star who i wont name it didnt help because i think hes a terrible actor and this didnt change my mind i was bored and looked at my watch many times while this played its boring obvious and manipulative why is this getting so much praise? skip itnegative,a not so unique mind thats responsible for polluting the world of cinema with an abomination that is the before trilogy strikes again by filming 2 child actors and 2 professional actors over the span of 12 years or so linklater has succeeded in producing a flick thats dramatically and cinematographically equivalent to average tv movies contrary to what most naysayers have said about it boyhood is actually loaded with drama and sentimentalism instead of nothingness the single mother the unreliable father the domestic violence the divorces the mothers plight in raising her two kids while attending college and finally getting a degree and becoming a teacher are some of the dramas thatas clichd as they might becould have been utilized as dramatic device yet the forced banalization of these events by jumping ahead year after

motivational movies its a sad effort to make us appreciate small victories in our everyday lives not to mention quite condescending as if the viewers are a bunch of emotionally and spiritually challenged individuals who have no ability to realize such sophomoric life insight the last scene with the mother loosing her composure and starting rambling about how meaningless her life is despite of the ups and downs and all of dramas she has experienced just because her son is leaving for college reads like a desperate attempt from the directorwriter to give a sense of climax and closure

good friend of mine the writer mark shulman once pointed out that our standards are being gradually eroded so that sadly we are left with less and less in lieu of a threshold of acceptability finding ourselves not unlike frogs in a pan being brought to a slow imperceptible boil christopher nolan and some of his cast are telling the press that interstellar is a love story i will take them at their word and assume that whatever else i picked up on was left there unwittingly for the rest of us to parse through considering how much pain is involved in traveling to and from a crowded movie theater on a saturday night i feel like its my prerogative when i have paid good money to take a film apart if i am still hungry for substance at the end of it and i will get my nourishment from something or other if not from the movies plot itself the first thing that strikes me when i think back to the experience of interstellar is that it leaves me with nothing emotionally  no takeaway i did not care about any of its characters or believe they were real and i did not really worry about the fate of humanity any more than the film itself actually does beyond paying it casual lipservice i wasnt awed like i may have been by other wondrous space movies that interstellar measures itself against or steals from and i am not compelled to go back and see any part of it ever again i suspect most viewers wont either once the collective neophile contact high has passed for starters i do not like the moral core of the story interstellar is a film about saving humanity but it is unclear who will pay for humanitys failures the film offers a great debate over where to repopulate but none about what we have learned from having to leave our home in the first place there is no therapy no penance no sacrifice in a way this represents a subconscious confession about our cultures moral failures when we run out of spaces to consume and out of fertile ground to slash an burn we will have to look for new worlds to expand out into since we cannot show self control and learn to care for what we have but enough psychobabble a dysfunctional moral compass is not the worst thing about interstellar the worst thing about the film is that to quote my girlfriend its ok to for characters to talk in pseudoscientific gobbledygook when the show is star trek because in star trek they all have pointy ears interstellar may be worth a glance certainly for the photography and exciting visuals but it is a buffet of messy ideas that fire in all directions clearly the script is not written by career screenwriters but by a director who has freed himself from gravity and has achieved his own artificial selfsufficiency amid the vast nothingness the result is an often farfetched and unintelligible outlandish tale which takes an awfully long time to suspend the viewers disbelief and cringing to finally arrive at a tepid plot after about an hour or so in hindsight it makes perfect sense that nolans tightest film is memento a discognitive story told from the point of view of a man who is unable to string two events together or to remember where he started interstellar is not an intelligent picture but a pseudointelligent one it seems designed to appeal to the sort of audience who loves to be flattered with cheap shots  a sort of space odyssey version of who wants to be a millionaire? its success resting entirely on the fact that every member of the audience gets to feel superior to whom? no one knows this technique seems to be trending within the nolans filmography for the rest the picture is a narrative mess that trivializes space travel on a galactic scale black hole wormhole same difference and is often plagued by ridiculous starstudded cameos that shatter the viewers concentration by landing in the middle of tense emotional scenes like a cockroach in your soup the film is oddly timed with elliptical cuts that compress the action into some often confusing edits and only leave in lieu of dialog some awful scenes of trite contrived exposition filled with emetic pseudo physics sure to give an immature modern audience raised on batman a sense that they are building their cultural ego by agreeing with this farce worst of all it feels long and never ending sadly good science fiction is hard to come by harder than a good ordinary film even and although this picture is somewhat entertaining it fades away from the heart and mind like the flickering green of the traffic light we just passed as we head home from the cinema once morenegative,3 hours of senseless drivel that is what i sat through when i watched interstellar the acting wasnt anything special but the screenplay it had to be among the worst three that i have ever sat through in fact i was close to walking out of it had it not been for the laughing in a scifi film like this the expected reaction was far from the real one instead of a gripping edgeofyourseat effect the screenplay and plot holes were so ridiculously bad that myself and a few other cinemagoers were in stitches laughing like prometheus but somehow worse this film had the adverse effect of inducing laughter in anybody who wasnt blinded by the interplanetary special effects in almost all scifi films there is an enormous twist in the plot or story that will strive to inspire a gasp in viewers some rare films have this effect with an excellently crafted twist not this time the twist in this film was again so extraordinarily awful badly thoughtout and farfetched dont get me wrong these films have the right to go more farfetched than any film has travelled before but this one was just plain bad i had to shout out come on when the credits began to roll inspiring a few more laughs there from viewers in agreement even here at at the end there were still unanswered questions that were to be solved at some point in the course of the film with its mediocre acting awful plot vexingly atrocious twist underdeveloped characters entrusting a savethehumanrace mission to a semirandom trespasser  hellooo??? and boring disposition throughout save your money and head to something  anything  elsenegative,***spoliers may be listed below**** maleficent is a an iconic villainous role she is one of disneys best characters cast from the dark side and when i saw the trailer i succumbed to the beauty they inlaid using jolie as the sinister evil fairy i was seduced to believing that i would be lured into a world of evil and treachery i wanted to see how evil was born and vengeance would be enacted i wanted to be able to bond with this evil force and be drawn deep into darkness rooting for the bad girl i knew it would be filled with beautiful scenes and disney magic but what i did not anticipate that the greatest treachery would be the film itself jolie can most definitely embrace evil and the moments when she is allowed to succumb to the full force of maleficent it is beautiful once you add in goldie locks however you get a recipe for disaster suddenly i might as well be in a world of pink pixie dust leprechauns and unicorns because this beautiful villain is disgraced into playing a role of a misunderstood black hearted fairy who really loved the doe eyed giggling aurora hell hath no fury than a woman scorned this should have been the driving force behind the film the beginning scenes of a youthful maleficent should have been nixed to allow more time to build a love story that was even remotely believable to fall from grace the betrayal has to be tangible and dripping with poison it must be something more than just a monologue infatuation and stolen wings they said years passed and yet i felt nothing of a bond or great love that would give birth to maleficents destiny in disneys rapunzel the mother figure who raised rapunzel from a baby never fell in love with the child as a daughter she was still greedy evil and dedicated to her path so why must the worlds most wonderful villain turn to a soft hearted godmother of a vapid child i know disney is trending this dont bet on the prince idea and thats fine i support that but reallythey thought this was no truer love if they think the king suffered by simply being tortured with the countdown till his childs demise then they are sadly mistaken that was childs play a woman changed by betrayal to the dark side has more ideas in her playbook that can make a man suffer madness would have been the king knowing that maleficent knew the entire time where aurora was hiding maleficent should have been sending him snippets of hair or visions of his daughter with the raven peering down at him while he slept he should have been physically and mentally destroyed a raving lunatic i would have rather liked to see a double treachery in the story that only the raven knew all along where aurora was and hid it from his mistress we could watch the anger burn and grow within maleficent because she wasnt able to find the child for 16 years that in the interim the raven would randomly turn into human form and it would have been those two that fell in love and the tragic day that maleficent discovers her location through some fools errand played by the three dopey fairies guarding her absconds with the child and lets the curse play out its course then i would have a mega battle scene at the edge of the forest against the king let her have her righteous moment when she takes his life all the while the king knowing his daughter is stuck in endless slumber with no hope of her being saved then during the battle the raven after escaping the battlefield leaves maleficents side to try and wake aurora when maleficent discovers her minions treachery the pain and anger at being betrayed for a second time by her own kind would fill her from the pit of her stomach up through her spine and a black fire filling her eyes transforming to the great dragon and an epic battle of good and evil which will lead to her glorious death that would have at least been something then they could have there happier ever after then all those still shots of maleficent looking like a falling angel in the glimmering sunlight would have been more picturesque more visually twisted overall i feel i paid $15 dollars for another movie funded by the prozac and xanax manufacturers that spread fallacies that evil fairies are really good vampires are not evil blood suckers and werewolves make great best friends its a snooze and a travesty if you love the traditional iconic role of maleficent remain in darkness and forget the lies the trailer told you for the glorious black dragon is covered in daffodils and pink tutus in this filmnegative,** minor spoiler ** i was really looking forward to this film i like movies and i like science fiction i like most of christopher nolans films and i think matthew mcconaughey has done some great acting work true detective for example so the film seemed to have all the ingredients that would make it enjoyable sadly though i found it to be a disappointment i think there are three reasons for this first and foremost i did not make any emotional connection with the characters matthew was supposed to be the hero and protagonist of the film but i didnt connect to him at all other characters eg the daughter the grown up son the matt damon character i found irritating regardless of the subject matter of a film i need to emotionally connect with the characters in some way secondly there were too many basic plot points that made no common sense im not talking about the science not making science sense as thats accepted and okay in a science fiction film *** spoiler next** for example matthew mcconaughey turns up at the nasa base and without any credible explanation is told hell be the pilot of the space ship?**spoiler ends** thirdly i think in attempt to make a serious weighty science fiction film with gravitas the entire tone of the film became too unremittingly seriousand they omitted to lighten the mood occasionally with a bit of appropriate humour take as a comparison the shawshank redemption which currently tops imdbs greatest movie poll a great film with gravitas and a serious message often emotionally dark and harrowing at timesbut it uses humour appropriately to balance the tone of the overall film so very sadly a real disappointment im afraidand i find myself genuinely puzzled why this film has got such a high imdb ratingin exactly the same way and same reasons that i was puzzled by the high rating for skyfallnegative,This was a bad bad movie. At one point I was going to ask for my money back because I thought that the reels were put in the projector in the wrong order. Save you money. Save you time. The best thing that you can do is to do anything except watch this movie. If I could rate lower that a 1 I wouldnegative,in which pretty much the only aspect that doesnt totally disappoint is the cinematography basically an elaboration of the set design on seven even the soundtrack is lukewarm and sounds horribly dated some brothers or someone norton is the kind of actor whom you either can or cannot watch i havent totally decided yet bonham carter still delivers a phoney stateside accent woody allen obviously hasnt helped and pitt only looks good in his eye to eye hotel room sequence with norton anyone who claims they see him as a good actor is either lying or is deluded  the guy just looks good with cropped hair other than this were looking at a film made for awkward teenage boys who cant watch it anyway cause its mostly rated 18 its the slightly older awkward boys who sadly do get to see it and end up slobbering over it and writing rave reviews about it a little rubbish goes a long way these days having appreciated both the game and especially seven id like to think fincher was presented with a job to be done and got away with it lets see what happens nextnegative, may spoil warning  i seen this in the theaters when it came out in 99 i payed $700 dollars to see it the second i found out the secret i wanted to beat someone up all right no plot plot dont make since if i was in a basement full of guys and had to watch someone abuse them self and they thought it was interesting i would exit as fast as i can i have to wright ten lines in order for me to be able to warn you that i dont even think this qualifies as a movie there is no plot or story that i can see making a movie about therese a point where his nonself shots a gun at him and blows out a van window so is the gun real is the bullet real did the window blow out or was that imaginednegative,preface i really think i was careful enough with my words to avoid any spoiling but if vague descriptions count as spoilers to you dont read on lets face it  its all about fighting  gruesome stupid uncivilized uncultured immature fighting if you are a caveman go ahead and like this movie if not then i am sincerely grateful for your existence in our world on a side note despite the plot holes i figured out who pitts character was since the endoftheapartment scene id be interested to know if anyone else was able to predict the same thing the very end of the movie falls under the same category as the body  immature shallow and useless i just gotta say it  this is my least favorite movie of all timenegative,fight club  anarchy takes a welltrained and organized army peace requires using 19th century technology to end 20th century technology thereby blowing us all back into the 18th century of course this all leads to great sex and a cure for demons inside you and along the way you can beat the hell out of a bunch testosterone leaden fellow travelers a really dumb movie bad acting and some of the most boring cinematography of 1999 skip this onenegative,a day after the experience i am still trying to reconcile how the man who was responsible for the magnificent subtlety of seven could create such garbage yes the violence was gratuitous and excessive but oddly enough that was the least of this films worries where to begin the plot was ridiculous on its face absolutely incoherent and nonsensical the various themes of the movie were amplified and remarkably shallow showing no real insight into the problems of our society ours is an overly commercial culture this is neither original nor especially interesting especially when repeated ad nauseam finchers direction and sophomoric mtvstyle presentation did nothing to help a script that never got any further than live free or die with minor variations most of the dialogue reminded me of something my high school english teacher used to say when her students ventured out of their league thats so deep its shallow this succinctly describes the handling of every major theme in the film then there are the performances edward norton an otherwise gifted actor does little with the simplistic character hes given there is no complexity to this character whatsoever and norton can do nothing to help define him his early attempts at playing the neurotic are particularly unconvincing brad pitt has more to work with in the tyler durden character but his tendency to overplay absolutely everything about his character even beyond what the script calls for or should have called for makes nortons performance seem that much more vapid helena bonham carter simply showed upnegative,a flop just about everywherecritics talk as though its a classici thought it was the pitsedward norton voice drove me mad i hate voiceoverswas there a point to the moviesome weirdos may get some crazy ideas from ita movie this bad deserves no praisea case of the emperors new clothes if ever i saw onenegative,a man tired of his yuppie condo and deadend job moves into a dilapidated house with a stranger and starts an underground club where young men beat each other up to bloody pulp just for the fun of it when that becomes old they engage in terrorist activities there is a lame plot twist which should not surprise most viewers that blows the story full of holes and turns the movie from merely bad to abominably bad culminating in a laughably ludicrous finale the message of this paean to sadomasochism is that a man has to suffer and inflict pain on others in order tosell tickets what is most disturbing is that many consider this vile piece of garbage to be a masterpiece a sad reflection of our societynegative,after having my little brother and friends hype the heck out of this film and claim it to be the greatest thing since sliced bread this came as a disappointment there were too many boring stretches for me and not much in the way of story it was like a no pun intended onepunch joke that fell flat about 30 minutes into the film brad pitt was good if out of place ed norton delivers his dialogue as if he were asleep and comes across as a secondrate john cusack wannabe helen carter is funny in parts and meatloaf is just hilarious thumbs in the middle for this one this movie fell flat at the boxoffice as struggling 20th century fox and this is not a bad thing tries to come up with fresh ideas to lure the teenage audience without having to recycle 30year old sciencefiction filmsnegative,after watching fight club and before writing this comment here i have watched it 6 times myself alone to find out why it got so many ratings and votes from the audiences just after 2000 i had watched lots and numerous movies existing in the world but so far no single comments are available here in this imdb now i am in bound to express my personal feelings about this unnecessarily overrated movie i find nothing special in this dumb and irritating fight club starring brad pitt and edward norton why did this movie got good stars and many comments just because others are dancing and so they too blindly dancing with them after getting into the story of tyler durden david fincher  i think david is good at making movies based on mental sickness human illusion and social understanding he could have used the actors in better perspective to make the whole story clearer than it is fight club  this movie was actually flopped when it released theatrically worldwide so can we really consider it as a hit or blockbuster no doubt it got momentum when it later came out in dvd i was mostly displeased with the twisting climax which has nothing special to thrill the human mind it is just simple to predict in some points of the story there are some scenes which make bored and eagerly wait to move forward in the next scenes this is not a case with good thrillers like the bourne trilogy series the peacemaker collateral jeepers creepers the recruit paycheck the shooter the departed or say impostor  for my 8 years of continuously watching different types of movies and analysing the choices of the audiences i came to confusion why audiences really admired this movie well it might have became a cultfilm for creating the ideas of building fight clubs but this movie actually has a negative and improper purposes the twisted ending seems to be much dissatisfying in catching the truth but in fact the movie has no concern with the worlds reality brad pitt  i wonder why brad pitt accepted the role as an illusionary tyler durden who rule the narrators way of living surprisingly he turned out as nonexisting person who appears from schizophrenic narrator jack norton i like pitt a lot his role in kalifornia and se7ven and mr & mrs smith but not here edward norton  i was really impressed by his role in only 2 hits  rounders and the italian job but this time also he won my heart for his innocence and ignorant role as jack he did his role as demanded by the script and the director or the producers he was a right choice for this role better than others helena bonham carter  she does not have the necessary looks to become a star or celebrity but by chance she got good remarks for her role here no impressions exist from her role as marla singer but only to look oncenegative,also one of the 10 worst films of all time are we sure ed wood is dead because i swear he must have written cast and directed this major turkey if people claim not to understand this film its merely because they have an iq of 3 i even read one critique by someone who watches this bomb every week talk about not having a life there was a half hour episode of alfred hitchcocks series that had the same plot and was 100 times better than this as to the acting well i couldnt find anyone doing that here but then ed norton is one of the worst actors alive today as is pitt so you shouldnt be surprised there meatloaf was the only person even trying but then he was saddled with an incredibly moronic script written by a 2 year oldnegative,and what a waste of talentsâŠ¦ and my time yes the movie does have some fancy camera work but i consider david fincher would be more successful to be a tv commercial producer than a movie director from seven to fight club i dont see any growth in his filmmaking dark and grotesque as usual or even more but his movies absolutely has no emotional impact on me excepts the unpleasant after tastenegative,as an earlier comment stated the first 23rds of this movie are truly intriguing the visuals are slick but not in you blademeetsmortalkombat kinda way instead focusing on delivering irony sarcasm and black jokes through flawless direction and edition  and even some hi tech effects like when the credits roll edward norton plays the narrator and the social satire presented during the first half of the flic is simply put awesome because the movie doesnt seem to take itself too seriously  althought it is serious  one plus point is the fact that the narrator doesnt step on a soapbox to preach and condemn he justnarrates and observes however after the first half of the movie is over it suddenly dulls and painfully slows down from the pace from which it begun for starters the attention to detail lowers the dialogues start to dumb down you get this anything can happen now no matter how far fetched feeling and plain and simple it just gets silly as in 6th sense another recent movie there a shocking twist near the end but instead of leaving you gasping for air like in the former here it all seems contrived forced it just doesnt fit all in all fight club is not a bad movie but i really wished it had ended as good as it startednegative,as nonsensical as the game as hollow as american beauty a loud flashy messy bore that had me watching the clock in anticipation of when this movie would end and so end my misery this and american beauty are among the biggest copouts in movie history cynical hollywood manipulations that make fools of their fans within the theatre walls we vent vicariously with the main characters about the evils of consumerism then what do we do after the credits roll eight dollars poorer having enriched and empowered the entertainment system we go back to the very lives these movies condemn now we can even browse through the ikea catalog without guilt because in spirit we have joined the fight club is living the lie okay just because you admit it more hypocritical moviemaking for hypocritical moviegoersyet another turn of the moneygoroundnegative,big strong handsome boys take their shirts off and sweat and fight each other oh boy oh yeah theres a girl in here too helena bonham carter but she kind of acts tough like a guy too lots of posing and posturing in this film its very cool i found it hollow and could care less clockwork orange said it better and was better acted 40 years ago rent that one insteadnegative,boring quasiphilosophical violencefeast the plot is dumb the surprise twist is not surprising the dialogue is stiff and lifeless with lines like what youÂ´re feeling is premature enlightenment furthermore helena bonham carter is really truly miscast how can anyone like this movie i know a lot of people do but i just cannot understand whynegative,brainless movie tries to make a point but comes across only as a cinematic failure a total waste of time which is sad given the admittedly quality performances yet asinine script the first third is promising but ultimately this mess of a picture only goes downhill with each brainless sequence that follows after this picture ended i wanted to erase it from my mind reviews on this site are typical of the below 20 group who like quick editing and dumbed down plots that have a secret message overall rating bomb remember the first rule of fight club is dont see fight clubnegative,chuck pallanick is a real piece of worst writing ever existing on this planet this is one fact admit it the fight club flick is a real decent screening of his terribly writing on to a silver screen this is the worst film of all time in all instances in all possible scenarios point no arguing here nothing simply nothing in this unimaginable horrific piece of manure gives any redeeming feature or any clue dirt mud muck slime blood vapid acting hollowness emptiness nihilism and a total waste of 120 minutes just terrible it is so edward norton gives a weak delivery brad pitt does not help too and helena bonham carter is simply awful this is the keyword  awful the whole finchers flick is just awful mess rating  must be minus 1000 but here 1 the worstnegative,coming from cast members whove enjoyed multimillion dollar la weddings etc if youre going to comment on issues as fundamental as this then live the lifestyle otherwise it just doesnt wash you should leave it to someone else pitt is also very unrealistic as a tough guy in this movie his performance in snatch was much better and benefited from some humour the chain smoking carter is also tedious and fake i found this movie both pretentious and irritating ive met many people who found this film illuminating it said absolutely nothing to menegative,david fincher i think his career might have been a tragedy if he actually made some good early films he had alot of promise but is now sucked into the world of the fanboy where he reins as their god this world is made up of angry youth most of whom like computers violence and sex though they are under experienced with it in actuality no more evident is this than in fight club if you need proof read one of the hundred claims that this is the pinnacle of filmmaking since these people are cultish and do not listen to reasonable argument i will waste so much time as to actually give the entire argument against this film as i see it i think fincher actually had a message however he has no control over his own abilities i think using logic his film is about the value of the individual this is extremely ironic since his film has inspired homogenous worshipers the first third of the film is a damnation of the working environment the last third is im guessing supposed to be a damnation of the second third the second third is the escape from the working class through a violent cult this is only the most logical explanation for me anyway i think many people fail to see the last third as a damnation of the second third because fincher creates it as such a paradise juxtaposed next to the working week fincher is too seduced by his own tricks that he cant convey his own message and we as viewers are left with the remnants of a very negative film with no purpose for its violent destructive nature and no redeeming values at all so maybe it isnt what the film is about most of its fans would gladly join up with the cult and follow tyler into chaos the message of the film is really quite hollow and the way it is done is just silly 310negative,despite remarkable acting this movie is not worth the extraordinarily long time it took to get through it this testosterone laden tale contains a semiinteresting twist toward the end but even that cant make up for the cliche filled you are what you own lame attempt at a moral message dont waste your timenegative,despite the clever crafting of this film it is basically a complainfest about the poor upperclass privileged white male blaming all his woes on ikea is this the extent of selfproclaimed victimization that is taking over american culture disturbingly to any intellectuals this movies amorality passes itself off under the guise of reason  as if the central character has a logic to his rage and subsequent violent decisions  as if the poor young white businessman whos been educated well and raised in an upper middle class lifestyle with all the benefits really is some sort of victim of retail stores is it really proving a coherent point to blow something up its even more upsetting to think about this after seeing 911 take this films logic into realityis the point of this movie to say that american commercial freedom should be attacked with all the sexification and glamorizing of violence and its poorme ranting against consumer products rather than taking responsibility for ones own commercialism or participation in it its hard to find a redeemable netsum to this movie ed norton is as always terrific brad pitt very good in this role too and i very much appreciate the filmmakers talent but i wish he would use it for something that was thoughtfulnegative,ed norton character i dont know im just not content with my life i have a job that doesnt do anything to benefit mankind i have so many possessions but they dont make me happy i just feel there must be more to life than this shallow commercial material world i live in i want to do something different me well its very commendable of you to reevaluate your priorities so since you dont like your material possessions are you going to get rid of all your ikea furniture and move to a smaller apartment one that you actually feel comfortable in norton no me well since your job isnt fulfilling are you going to quit and join the peace corps or get a job as a teacher in an poor neighborhood norton nah me well since youre looking for some higher meaning to life are you going to start going to church norton nope me sigh okay so what are you going to do norton i think ill get together with a bunch of other unfulfilled guys and then well beat the snot out of each other  if that strikes you as profound well then fight club is the movie for you if it sounds ridiculous and it should avoid it like the plague the ironic and amusing thing is most of the fanboys who rave about this movie are geeks who couldnt fight their way out of a paper bag and would run crying to their mommies if someone even looked like he was going to throw a punch at themnegative,fight club 1999 stars brad pitt and edward norton when ed norton gets insomnia he starts to venture into another world when he meets brad pitt this movie makes no sense i had no idea where it was going i was very disappointed in the film i couldve wrote it better and more realistic i wish i didnt see this film i hated every second of it fight club has an interesting plot but i fail to see the actual validity of the punchline having said that i didnt like the film it just doesnt add up correctly if you watch each and every scene however we are watching it through the eyes of edward norton i dont understand all the hoopla over this film go watch the sixth sense for this kind of stuff and if you can believe this can really happenyou are an idiotnegative,fight club hooks you fast and has a lot going for it fincher does a great job directing and pitt and norton are great as well unfortunately the last 20 minutes with its clever little twist totally ruined it for me i think that the basic ideas behind the book got lost in the translation to a certain extent but not completelynegative,fight club is not a landmark cultmovie showing a disappointed and frustrated generation this a toolong tedious dull film just made to forgive it asap brad pitt must believe that being a good actor means playing nut insane filthy unshaved peoplenegative,fight club is the most overrated movie i have ever seen barely beating out gladiator it is also one of the worst movies ive ever seen its only redeeming quality is if you take it as an examination of mob mentality in a group of reprobates  except in that light its quality ends up seeming like someones final project for their high school psychology class as in amateurish and not very detailed people talk about its depth my answer to that is what depth i have no problem with its premise  people are dissatisfied hey i could handle the computers that rule the future can build a nearlyindestructible attack robot out of liquid metal in terminator 2 dissatisfied people is nothing even the incorrect placement of blame is believable what bothers me though is that the movie attempts to pass itself off as an accurate portrayal of the real world im not saying there arent people like that what im saying is that they arent right they arent automatons theyre unambitious they arent suppressed by an overlymaterialistic society theyre just whining and looking for someone else to blame for their problems i have an easier time believing marxs nonsense about class identity than i do the things this film tries to pass off as meaningful social commentary fight club doesnt have a social message fight club isnt entertaining dont watch fight clubnegative,fight club would lead you to believe that is an action thriller which has excitement in it and keeps you gripped until then end well lets just say this film could save the nhs a fortune in sedatives edward norton an amazingly talented actor his talent is mirrored in films such as american history x and so on films where his talent is actually apparent i sat until the end of the film thinking ok anytime soon it will get exciting it was so obvious they way the film was going to go and took a very long time to get there why anyone would cast helena bonham carter is also beyond me brad pitt is an ok actor but is blessed with looks apparently more than he is talent so many people have claimed how amazing this film is but i just do not see it a few predictable twists and turns and the climax at the end is neither here nor there as bad endings go this is one of the worst i have seen glad i did not pay to see this in the cinema if you need something to knock you to sleep check this outnegative,first off im not going to say this film was terrible and anyone who disagrees with me is an idiot we all have our own idiosyncrasies that colour how we view art and i respect others views enough to know that nothing is categorical terrible or brilliant for every member of the audience but for mei think fight club had something to say but to me it didnt seem very original or subtle among other themes in other films ive seen the two identities thing done much better in david lynchs lost highway and feel american psycho did the male alienation in corporate america thing in a subtler and funnier way fight club seemed so straightforward and obvious that i felt like the director was dumbing it down for me almost insulting my intelligencei dont know maybe its just my taste im glad so many people did get so much out of it though that is one of the most important criteria for a film to have to be considered great so i guess this is a great filmnegative,first the good stuff the acting was superb edward norton was very strong though i expected more somehow and brad pitt was a phenomenon im glad sean penn pulled out of this role though im sure he would have nailed it as well and in a very different way ill bet the direction was also interesting though it seemed like the director was enjoying himself to much so much of it seemed like the wouldnt it be cool if style of direction now the bad stuff this plot is more full of holes than independence day i mean it makes absolutely no sense whatsoever other reviewers have said that if you go to this movie you must be prepared to think very true you must think about the films themes and the films subtext every step of the way this was extremely interesting and enjoyable but whatever you do please do not think about the plot it doesnt hold up under any scrutiny at all at a very basic level this film doesnt make sense i cant elaborate without throwing out a huge spoiler so i wont if you ask me plot is the first thing if you have a weak plot that can be forgiven by other strengths but if your plot cant even stand up without the willful indulgence of a forgiving audience then youve already fouled up too big to ignore this movie could not have been good without massive script alterations no matter how good the acting how good the directing how clever the dialogue this movie could not have been other than a travesty of modern film horrible on the other hand from the number of posters here who seem to think that edward nortons character was named jack its quite clear that people indeed dont pay very close attention to films no wonder this film is so highly regardednegative,gratuitous violence and a cheesy madeforteenagers twist at the end i suspect that males under the age of 20 will love it though the drivel disguised as philosophy will fool the naive and someone somewhere will be dumb enough to emulate the fighting one or two visits to the hospital though will be enough to change most folks mindsnegative,have you ever had flu or food poisening and have been laid up in bed with a fever you know the feeling you loose all track of time  you are not sure if you have slept and your dreams drift in to real life have you ever been so drunk that you wish you were dead the feeling is the worst in the world isnt it watching the fight club is all these feelings rolled into one i can honestly say this is nearly the worst film i have ever seen i wont try to go into what the film is about because i could not tell you this film last 16 hours or so it feels looking at the box it says 133 minutes i would rather have spent 133 minutes sticking pins under my finger nails what complete rubbish please dont watch it 1 out of 10negative,havent seen it but i know its crap the popularity of this movie and its director invalidates the claim that its iconoclastic any movie that is this popular is false opposition period you think a major movie studio would finance something that truly threatened the establishment the passion of the christ was a truly iconoclastic movie it scared the crap out of the establishment which is primarily jewish and masonic which is why the talmudists in hollywood went after gibson with all their force you can also tell a lot about a movie based on its fans ive never encountered anyone who likes this movie who isnt a poseur usually young white dorky guysnegative,having just finished viewing fight club on video my opinion is it was awful however i noticed i was in the vast minority of others who voted just goes to show how opinions can vary i did like the cast and felt the three lead characters were very good but their talents were wasted if you took out the popularity and charisma of pitt and norton and replaced them with lesser known actors the video would hardly be worth watchingnegative,honestly this movie marks some fresh and new to cinema great film making style and plot direction and cast was good too but here comes the boomthis film represents the modern era where anything can be sold to the fools just by advertising and wrapping it in a catchy packing so while watching this movie i was feeling as if i am getting sick literally but i just watched it because of its high rating the film talks about releasing self from limitations and lack of emotional strength so far so good but a dying patient cant be cured by hypnosis it is a useless effort now our patient is dying death is playing its game and his relatives around himall those who loved the moviethinks that due to hypnosis their beloved patient is not crying that means not feeling pain that means getting cured now thats what i call fools gold honestly again but i am not buying this stuffnegative,how can we get brad pitt edward norton and meatloaf to beat the cp out of each other this movie solves that problem and gives the studio license to shoot a film veiled in psuedophilosophies and violence its just dumb dont try looking beneath the surface because nothing is there maybe thats the point it provides that men are imasculated and shackled by modern life their spirits crushed by their jobs and their possessions in order to escape you fight its so simple give up the banalities of ordinary life and find your individuality in a black tshirt fight gang makes sense teenage males will certainly think so since it is filmed in the mtv style bright color palette fancy edits blood mesmerizing and simple philosophies tend to go over well on that demographic it actually starts our promisingly i loved the first quarter only when it attempts to provide us with answers that are sorry far out of the grasp of the writers does it fail film buffs may want to view it simply for one of the sloppiest tackedon surprise endings in cinema history i could only laugh bottom line dumbnegative,how do you know youre crazy when your masculine side is banging your feminine side and all you can do is listen this highly regarded film is nihilistic garbage offensive and pretentious all attitude and jungian stereotypes skip itnegative,i agree completely with the negative critics statements on the inside of the dvd this movies defenders have tried to pass it off as cerebral and psychological on this very page and as a profound portrait of how corporations ruin our lives it is none of these first of all what makes people think its cerebral the endless whining the laughable were all the middle children of history attempts at philosophizing the hardly novel idea that men need to have an outlet for their pentup aggression and the leftist idea which has been out there since at least the time of marx that corporations have been destroying our lives and screwing us over praise the movie as cerebral and youd better be cerebral yourself to recognize it get yourself a book of dostoyevsky or kant and see how you handle real deep thought second off that its psychological simple because the main character has a certain mental disorder i wont be so bad to reveal what it is is it psychological after we see the characters illness in the movie it seemed to me norton fighting pitt was like a bad candid camera joke i was halfexpecting the director to come on after the scene and say you took that scene seriously sucker its amazing what this movie expects you to believe particularly after the plot twist which like the usual suspects to which it has been often compared is just too clever by a half and voids entire sections of the movie im a fan of ed norton because i like his work i also liked seven quite a bit so i can hardly be dismissed as a fincherhater and i still agree that men in our society are fundamentally demasculinized in a way previous generations never had to deal with but after seeing this movie i think the solution may be worse than the curenegative,i am 34 i have seen thousands of films and this is unquestionably the absolute worst it is evil technically well done but evil still this film shits on every value i hold dear  honesty hard work liberty of thought nonviolence respect of others as equals reason as my best tool to make something of my life it glorifies senseless destruction of property and which is much much worse of able minds in cultlike brainwashing to serve egoistical means every problem should be overcome with violence lies or blackmail every man who is not you is there to be used or beaten into a pathetic degenerate there is no respect of the other also the plot twist had me wincing it was so very obvious from the start that when it happened i just sighed and shook my headnegative,i am mad i had wasted 2 hours of my life seeing this garbage because i read all the high ratings from members is everybody crazy to rate this crap over 8 this is about as stupid as 12 monkeys i bet its the same people who liked that movie like this one brad pitt made a great movie  meet joe black he made so many other stupid movies  or inconsequential such as  the mexican hes a handsome man but other than that can never be tom cruise i dont like tom cruise  hes not as nice as brad but he sure is a great actor this movie is all about violence anarchy annihilation why does anybody think blowing up a building beating the crap out of each other committing suicide is worth making a movie about this is very irresponsible of the director as this is what brought us columbine virginia tech and massive killing mayhem on a daily basis how can all this be entertainment i think the people liking this movie must be either juveniles the video game crowds mindless activitywho never pick up a book read the newspaper  be pro family or somewhat low iq to watch this pointless idiotic movienegative,i cannot believe the number of rabid fans this sophomoric selfindulgent piece of watered down nietzsche crossed with herman hesses steppenwolf has garnered if this film was a lifechanging experience for some of the reviewers i am wrung with pity at what that life must have been before and with the thought of what it can have become there was some amusing satire in here but you had to wade through a lot of adolescent posing and prosing to hear it i am commenting only because i think this tawdry junker needs a counterpoint to its unmerited adulation if you found a lot in this movie and want to watch it again and again to validate your deep philosophical and artistic insights you need to broaden your horizons grow up and join the real world ask for more from your art than thisnegative,i cannot believe this film is rated so highly granted there is a hollywood bias in this database but rarely is such an idiotic film given such accolades after seeing the poster for this film i had no interest in seeing it but i watched it on the advice of a trusted friend and was amazed at how much it was exactly as i had expected originally a macho guy film on a par with the die hards and lethal weapons of this world rambo toonegative,i dont know about anyone one else but when i watch a film i have one goal to be entertained i can say without any reservation i was not entertained for even one minute during fight club what really shocks me is that this film is rated so highly apparently so many who have watch this film find the bizarre so appealing to me a film is good when its entertaining you know enjoyable to watch i found nothing even remotely enjoyable about this film fight club is nothing more than a film about dysfunction and lots of it bizarre hallucinations and violence is this thought provoking or intelligent sorry i dont see that my recommendation if youre a person who looks for true entertainment in a film look elsewhere i am definitely worse off for spending 25 hours on fight club i give it 1 out of 10negative,i for one hated this moviei only saw it once and it was a long time ago so forgive any incorrect references personally i dont know if i saw it again now if my opinion would be differentmaybe but somehow i doubt it the beginning was interesting enough to entertain mespecifically the whole him going to different group session things as a hobby and then meeting marla who does the same thing thats interesting i think the whole thing started to bore me about when the movie started going nowhere from what i remember it was just marla living there and brad pitt beating the crap out of edward norton every night or whatever it just lost its interest the end was a cool twist the whole tyler thingit was interesting but the film as a whole i dont think was just very well presented maybe if id read the book itd make more sense i just think i didnt like it because it didnt make sense to me i understand this makes me a bit of an outcast because everyone loves fight club but i apologizejust not my taste if anyone wants to just explain a few key points out for me or something thatd be great just please dont rip me a new one because i understand i am like the only one who doesnt like that movie slidenegative,i hated every single second of this miserable movie its boring unfunny and totally depressing everytime norton does his voiceover i wanted to cry he has the dullest voice in the history of film norton is so over rated i dont know why he is seen as a good actor i am a fan of pitt but he is totally wasted and i came to realise this is sadly nortons film not pitts if you want to to be bored and depressed for a few hours feel free to watch this trashnegative,i have just finished watching fight club simply put it is the most profoundly depraved and deeply disturbing film i can ever remember seeing if our culture was not crumbling at a full gallop we would see this vile and wicked film for what it is could such a film have been made even twenty years ago will anyone care or even take notice of such a film twenty years from now we are lostnegative,i have read many reviews for this movie and most of them used words like unique excellent and life changing i have just one question how the acting by both the leads was good i got to admit that but havent people heard of something called a script the movie was just a collection of pathetic scenes each one leaving you more confused and bored then u were before well for direction there wasnt any all in all i have to say i have seen my share of bad movie this one is a strong contender for the top spot its a shame talent like brad pitt considered doing such a mindless senseless scriptless and tasteless movie which even the brilliant acting by the male leads couldnt save the one point is purely for the actingnegative,i have read other reviews of this movie and i think that my outlying grossly negative opinion may have something to do with the fact that i do not identify at all with this movie i am proud to say this it is sad that so many people did see something of themselves in this movie i feel truly sorry for you it was obviously never this movies intent to be entertaining or to make you care about the characters humanity or societynegative,i know everyone is saying that this movie is great it has so much to say about society the script is so good blah blah blah for the first time in my life however i was motivated actually to get up and to leave the theatre in the middle of the film yes the movie has a message beyond fighting is good but it is just so inyourface that i couldnt take any more after the first hour it did not help that i didnt care what happened to any of the characters even though i dont have a problem with brad edward or helena generally anyone who saw this movie and came away wondering exactly what the director was trying to say must have been asleep i dont think that a film has to be completely offensive to make a point of course this is only my opinion i know there is supposedly a plot twist at the end and whatever it was it just could not have been worth another hour and a half of this film to get to it by the way i have seen other offensive movies and enjoyed them natural born killers being one of them so i am not just being a weenie about the whole thing i liked se7en and i completely loved the game but this one just is not up to their standards see one of these movies instead if you have never seen a fincher film beforenegative,i ordinarily dont take the time to comment on things of this nature but this is possibly the worst movie i have ever seen fight club had absolutely no plot and no message to give to the audience it was replete with violence sex gore all with no purpose whatsoever the movie said nothing  it was just film and actors if i had to describe this movie in one word it would be gratuity there was gratuitous sex violence and blood and guts apparently a lot of people enjoyed this movie and i dont know what that says for our society and how easily we can be entertained this movie is a waste of anyones time i highly recommend that you stay as far away from fight club as possiblenegative,i really didnt enjoy this film at all & i fall into the target group male 2030 210 id give this there seems a belief too that anyone who doesnt enjoy it is either thick against violence or especially doesnt get the message behind it well none of those apply to me in this flawed film i understand that it was any of aa group of young men rebelling against a borgeousie consumerism society bone man seeing how he is totally dissatisfied with life and how his mind tries to change things or cpeople stopping to watch cornelius fight himself because voyeurism is human nature the film makes a deliberate attempt to make the viewer feel guilty for being a voyeur ill come to that later you can take your pick really whatever way i still find it crap any film shawshank redmeption excepted which concerns one mans anything generally creates no emotion in me other than boredom the whole tagline to the film makes me want to puke one 30 year old mans journey of selfdiscovery so what are we supposed to sympathise with norton because of this im sorry but i have sympathy in films with people dying or whos family have been killed john hurt triumphing over cancer in champions tom hanks in saving private ryan thousands of others even norton himself actually in the brilliant american history x in the 2nd half i sympathise with him for the life he has found himself with but in this and i find myself saying the same as i did with the equally awful american beauty just because some blokes fed up & having a midlife crisis were supposed to feel for him oh diddums the only film where this premise has worked brilliantly is its a wonderful life with james stewart he was in crisis and justifyably too but never resorted to any of the levels stooped to here that might seem a weak point but its just come to me & i cant put my finger on exactly why wonderful life is so far superior to fight club in tackling a midlife crisis but they are as far extreme as you can get id also question whether were all voyers for every moron that slows down on a motorway to look at an accident on the other side theres a 100 or so that cant believe the stupidity of it there are countless flaws too the scene prior to the car crash wouldnt have worked who was norton talking to with the passengers there where did he acquire his knowledge of soap from would people have watched 1 bloke fighting himself and much more too ok maybe one or 2 of those have answers but i couldnt find them i think to really enjoy this film you have to have clicked or empathised with the main character and if you did i feel a bit sorry for you it would however account for the popularity of such things as marriage guidance councillors drugs footballers agents even to a degree religion but only when it becomes absolutely fanatical & life revolves around it maybe its just me & im fortunate but so many people seem unable to get through the little problems that life throws up on their own & without help of any kind anymore like inventing a friend for one thing i know plenty of people who like this intelligent some of them so ive no problem with people who enjoy arty & deep films with psychological meaning to them i just dont but not through failing to understand them just merely through not connecting with characters who suffer problems like a midlife crisis for non deserving reasons on top of all of that it was a very slow film toonegative,i refuse to give away details of a film therefore this commentary is directed at people who have already seen the movie and may be a bit obscure to those who have not silly plot gratuitous violence way too long and very predictable if the mono frame shots of pitt and the identical baggage clues werent enough to explain exactly what was happening then hb carters reaction scene when norton asks her what she is doing there the morning after should have made it crystal clear for anyone over twelve i was shocked by how many previous comments referred to an unexpected twist at the end fight club is simultaneously homoerotic and homophobic i think the overwhelming popularity of this film among 1825 year old confused males unfortunately may be explained by the concept repeatedly expressed throughout the film that it is ok to bond with or even hug other men but only if you also hurt each other i can only recommend purchasing or renting this dvd to those readers who are both somewhat sadistic and not very brightnegative,i remember reading somewhere that mr bpitt said that the significance of this film would be appreciated by people of next centurywhat does that mean and who makes him the expert on peoples thought in the next century all i hope is that he should be born in the next centuryso that i dont have to see his face and hear his name all the time while i am alive i am feeling increasingly that we as moviegoer are becoming snobbish all the time it seems nowadays movies are intended not for you to watchbut for you to interpretthen instead of taking coke and popcorn into cinemas we should have a notebook and pencil at hand what this movie is all abouti dont knowand i am wondering how many of you people out there do know what it is and why it is so greatare there really so many extreme situations and times in our lives if it isthen staying normal should be viewed as something abnormalafter allwhat is wrong with the ordinary mens life and feelingsshouldnt movies display these instead of showing people the extreme cases all the time as to mr norton i have but just one feelingtruly admirationof all the movies i have seen him playing he is always suffering from a split personalityhe must either be a complete nuts or the toughest guy alivepsychologicallyand what is funny about peoples high appreciation of him is that there must be so many of you who are living experts on abnormity of personality otherwise how can you truly appreciate a thing weird as that honestly i hate movies like thisits so called tasteonly makes people snobbishto meit is far more noble to go to a moviebecause you want to see a certain actor or actressthen because you are told this is one deep movie by those sick film criticsnegative,i saw this film at a free preview about a week before it was released and two years later i can still remember how angry i was wasting an evening on this drivelthe whole premise that these guys cant feel any emotion unless theyre beating the hell out of each other is ridiculous and boringi cant remember one thing i liked about this movienot the scriptnone of the performancesthe editing or cinematographynothingmaybe this film taps into the current anarchist views and aspirations of whatever generation were up tobut who caresif there was a  lower than onei wouldnt hesitate to mark it on my ballotnegative,i saw this film at the cinerama dome on sunset strip in hollywood when it was first released i am upset with myself for not walking out in the middle and demanding my money back i stayed and gave it a chance to my utter dismay this foul piece of crap is one of the worst films i have ever seeni get more pleasure out of deliberately bad films like  plan 9 from outer space  fight club  actually masquerades as something artistic meatloaf discarded any dignity or selfrespect he might possess by accepting this pathetic roleaside from the sick i dont mean the current vernacular premise and the idiotic plot the fact that morons are out there now beating the hell out of each other in basements as a form of mimicry and tribute is disgusting to mean abomination of a movienegative,i saw this movie about 3 years ago for the first time and i was impressed i really liked that movie very much i got the blu ray quality now and decided to check it out again after i finished watching this movie i told to myselfthis is so stupid this movie does not make any sense it is the movie about some psycho schizo guy i dont know how why its got 88 rating if you look at this movie seriously you can find so many mistakes and errors and so much stupidity in that movie i will never want to see this movie again in my life luckily you can download any movie for free nowadays before buying it i give this movie 1 star for good actors only if there were different actors 1 star would be too much other than that this movie is a big mistakenegative,i voted this movie be 110 stars on this website which is way to much for a movie like this i didnt like the atmosphere in the film at all beating each other without any reasonable reason besides that there were lots of blasphemic things in this movie in combination with very violent language i think filmmakers show that they are incompetent by using a script that contains lots of violent words why would you might think right now almost all real good movies like gladator the green mile lord of the rings and the shawshank redemption show us that you create atmosphere by good acting and story tellingtherefore you dont need actors to use blasphemic language all the time this movie was bought by a friend of mine and we watched it at his home we both got so sick and tired to watch this crap that he opened the dvd player even before the movie actually ended and broke the dvd we went smoking outdoorsbut my evening was truly spended on a movie worthless to seenegative,i was not going to watch this movie because the previews did not appeal to me and i am probably the only woman living who does not think that brad pitt is sexy however i have heard several people tell me what a good movie this is and more than half were women so it came on cable and i decided to watch it at 2 hours i turned it off and i was sorry that i waited that long i kept hoping that it would get better i understand the materialism is bad theme i also understand the concept of ed nortons character having everything but feeling so lonely and depressed that he starts fight club with brad pitt in order to get attention and feel wanted what i dont get is after starting the fight club why start making bombs and blowing up buildings so the point that i get from this movie is that it is ok to start andor join terrorists organizations because someone is unhappy pathetic and generally miserable with their life i guess that all the folks that found this movie appealing and humorous did not have friends or love ones in the world trade towers or the pentagon because wasnt it a bunch of unhappy miserable materialisthating people that bombed both of those places the only thing that makes me depressed are movies like thisnegative,i wasted $650 tonight seeing fight club i plan on returning to the theatre tomorrow and requesting a refund from the manager because i do not want my dollars supporting such a movie i would call it a film but it does not deserve such an honor the best way i can describe this movie is to say that i came away from it feeling visually and mentally raped it was thoroughly violent but violence is not what offended me most the violence for violence sake offended me the pointlessness of the movie offended me the god hates you dialogue offended me i was glad to see that 2 other people had already agreed with me and given the movie a rating of 1 do not waste your money on this movie do not waste your time on this movie brad pitt fans  resist the urge to see this attack on your selfworth and intelligence i could go on but you get the picture fight club  stay awaynegative,i watched end of days directly after this disjointed feature and the ahnold piece came out looking like the godfather there was a lot of talk when alien3 came out that david finchers limitations as a music videocommercial director would hamper the films presentation i was pleasantly surprised that this ended up not being the case apparently he has decided to devolve into that predicted state this film was not a bad idea and the acting was good with what was provided so that leaves us with the presentation being the problem the focus of the film was very disjointed the dialogue was vague and an seemed to try too hard and coming up with the next big quotable and the cinematography was  well  fincher  if youre going to roll a film that is so colorless just make it black and white id love to see them remake this movie with some different direction  there was some real potential in itnegative,i went to see this with a friend because id heard it was good at the local imax theater no less i went in with absolutely no knowledge on it whatsoever once i actually saw it i realized it was one of the worst movies ive ever seen and ive seen some real stinkers id rather have my eyelids held open by toothpicks while tied to a chair in front of a screen showing a back to back ed wood marathon i cant think of a single thing i enjoyed about fight club what there is of a plot is all over the place the lines are beyond cringeworthy its way too preachy and the plot twist at the end manages to veer off way past the range of strange into the range of bat crazy the secret longing of men is to beat each other up in basements and blow up buildings who knew much like the fights theres no subtlety in the plots yeah yeah materialism is bad were not what we own blah blah blah did we really need that pounded into our skulls for almost 2 hours if you feel like youre in a rat race and you hate your job then quit and find something to do thats more worthwhile to you i could hardly believe that was brad pitt his performances in 12 monkeys and se7en were far superior to this trashy flick is fincher incapable of making a movie that doesnt look like the lenses have been sprayed with campbells beef broth the cinematography is choppy and theres only so much i can take of random dudes beating the snot out of each other for no reason they should have used some of that soap to clean up the film from me 1 starnegative,i wont try to write an outline of the film others have done a good job of that here already ill just confine myself to observing my own reaction to it this is one poor movie due to the buildup i expected something pretty good my enthusiasm went progressively downhill as i watched the story develop and when ed norton performs the revealing scene which i suppose i should not describe here i felt like pulling the tape out right there i was that insulted i am struck with jaw dropping amazement at the vote results here in imdb what possible value does this movie have to place it higher than so many great films in the top 250 list i have a feeling that this flick speaks to the 16 to 21 year old male the same group that the worlds armies traditionally love to make eager immortal uncritical soldiers from i would like to see a demographic breakdown of the registered voters in imdb i get the impression that a hoard of enthusiastic male youths flooded the imdb with high votes immediately after the release of this puerile tale oh well if you want to vote this sloppy trash highly knock yourself outnegative,ive heard many people say and seen many reviews written that fight club is a classic mind blowing completely fresh sorry but i just dont see it ill start with the positives ed norton and brad pitt were excellent pitt perfectly captures the supercool no attachments nothingtolose attitude that so many young guys have before they get old and come back down to earth norton is also perfect as the uptight frustrated yuppie bored with lifes vapidity even helena bonham carter who i normally dont much care for was okay in the generic girlfriend role now on to the negatives the story is just utterly preposterous maybe even more so than finchers last absurd movie the game the movie really lost all believability when fight club turns into the cult project mayhem although it has a nice twist ending with the pittnorton dynamic i couldnt buy that they could get legions of grown men to become such mindless fanatical followers pitts charismatic but not nearly charismatic to cover up the fact his philosophy is tired and his idea of subversion is nothing except vandalism and petty theft the movie has pretensions of making a statement about consumerism but i thought it made them pretty succintly with the intro where norton describes his perfect condo filled with things he really didnt need everything else is overkill and the final big plan to blow up i wont say what in case you havent seen the movie yet in order to level the world playing field iswellpointless just like the game fincher takes some good parts and sews them into a tapestry of mediocrity i give it 6 out of 10negative,if director david fincher wanted us to honestly believe that we have not evolved one bit from the scum that at one point inhabited this earth than he has brillantly done it the first problem i have with this film is that it drags on about a half an hour to long and trust me that half an hour at the end could possibly be the stuipidest ending ever what starts off as a promising look at a bunch of low lives letting off some stream by beating the hell out of each other mainly due to the always great edward norton slowing take a nose dive into pure stupidity this movie becomes so trashy i had to take a shower directly after watching it to feel clean again the main problem with this film is that there is only about 15 minutes of fighting the rest is a bunch of losers running around the city destroying things and then turns into a comptly unbeliveable ghost story the film is not a complete watse though due to several amusing scene in which ed norton punches brad pitt in the ear and when pitt edits images of male genitalia into childrens movies but besides that this could very well be the worst movie ive ever seen so unless there is absolutly no other options steer clear of this trashy messnegative,if senseless violence and acrimonius rage are your idea of a good time get help this movie is profound rage and mind numbing horses with no plot a cynical theme and nihilistic metaphysical worldview i thought it may have been about boxing clubs not hypomanic arsonist with dark visions of paranoid delusion hours passed by without any meaningnegative,if you find anything at all edifying in this film then you must be incredibly gullibleeven for a filmgoer never got past the idea that we were being sold this supposed critique of our consumerist soulless society by none other than news corporation rupert murdoch these people are just toying with youtheyre in it for the money and have no conviction whatsoever as is born out by the endingthe film goesnowhere avoid this nonsensenegative,if youre looking to waste an evening with overindulgent tripe then this just might be the film for you david fincher has made an entire career out of making films that cater to the lowest common denominator and the basest of instincts and with fight club he outdoes himself whats worse than finchers hamfisted direction is the performance of the nonactors brad pitt and edward norton everything they do tends to either be overthetop bad or so very unforgettable as to almost be nonexistent from uninspiring frame one to the thank god its over final frame this pictures drags itself around on its half baked premise like the last steps of someone on their last breath of life save yourself the time and seek out something far more substantial than thisnegative,it is a very entertaining film with all the violence and actions the plot is somewhat intriguing as well however i just felt that the film tries too hard to deal with the topic of the unconscious and the other half of self yet it falls very short of developing it as a themem in the end other than chewing on some popcorns i got nothing out of that movienegative,its amusing to see all the brilliant comments about this crap film fincher a smoke and mirrors hack who is convinced that more is more wants to sell you on the idea that were living shallow lives the proofs in the pudding here folks he bashes you over the head with his themes like a college sophomore he is a master of the odious puerile wouldnt it be cool if this happened school of story construction the film is filled with desperate attempts at comedy mostly of the grossout toilet variety  so no doubt the sub20 dilettantes are enthralled  but the film is walltowall form over substance most annoying are finchers pet signature moments  youll see them in all his worthless work mention a pilot light  and voilÃ  the camera flies around a stove and shows you a pilot light presumably he finds this is magical as he repeats it everywhere  but we know its simply his unleashed attention whore personality being imposed where it doesnt belong theres no need to spoil the ending  its obvious to any thinking person within the first 10 minutes whats going on fnegative,just came from a sneak preview of this movie edward norton was nice enough to bring the movie to his alma mater yale university but unfortunately it doesnt live up to the preliminary hype or to the quality of his other work the problem here isnt acting he is still good in a demanding role that merited top billingrather than being put under pitt and the rest of the cast does admirably as well although brad pitt has played a role much like this beforesee 12 monkeys and helena bonham carters role is pretty much as demeaning to women as it gets jared leto and meat loaf yes meat loaf are also in this movie although you may not recognize leto with a badly scared face or meat loaf with breastsno i didnt stutter this film owes a lot to the game david finchers last movie in that it ends up with a complex plot that is solved a little too easily and nonlogically i wont destroy the film by explaining how exactly but the movie basically builds up to a climax that just doesnt resolve much and then resolves that with a further illogical ending the laughs along the way are not for the faint of heart or those who dont appreciate black comedy but they are the highlights of the film from the odd humor of norton and carter being addicted to help sessions for diseases they dont have to pitts interesting use of liposuction byproducts theres never too much appeal to the violence of the movie but the combination of nihilism and comedy doesnt send the movie into mediocrity its when the movie turns serious that it starts to turn sour as the plot twists out of control and a strange comedy turns into just another movie in the seventhe gamethe matrix genre of stylish mindless violence without much purpose point or original plot the script shows elements of literature that may have just been better in the original book but otherwise this is a movie with not much going for it except its cast answering questions edward norton joked about how working with brad pitt was easier for him because he could always rag on him about pitts bad movies whenever hed get on me id just have to say cool world and also said he thought he had yet to be part of a stinker this may just be his first and pitts latestnegative,just the fact that most men that drool over this film tend to react angrily when i convey my negative opinions of fight club proves that this film not only fails to deliver any new and important ideas but also that it encourages the mainstream male marketing plan be angry be violent be masculine be straight be selfish and most of all be stupid the film employs a juvenile sense of humor comedy approach thats immature and sickening the ending is a total idiotic rip off that makes the watching of this garbage a waste of time the deep message here is that young white males victimized by society can fight commercialism by beating the st out of each other wow man thats really deep cue you just dont get the movie man yeah i just dont get the movie what a joke the whole premise behind fight club is tiresome and trite oh the poor straight healthy young male and how hes been victimized fight club is a movie produced by the sickening hollywood greed machinenegative,let me just get this out of the way right off the bat  i hated this movie i think the initial meeting of jack and tyler explain how opinions of this movie are divided  jack says something about single serving friends and tyler disinterestedly dismisses his cleverness unfortunately my friends being clever for clevers sake is not entertaining and it is not art for those of you who loved this movie perhaps identifying yourselves with the main character is not appropriate the point may be that you are just one of the moronic automatons do hyperclever acts of terrorism like a hyperclever movie so the jokes on you you might also note that the project chaos morons are not recruited for their propensity for violence but for their desire to think in complex and sensitive ways much like the fans of this movie i tend to rate a movie on only two criteria was it entertaining and did i care about the characters as both of these answers for fight club are definitely no what am i left with a movie with an unoriginal message revealed in an unintellible way full of commercials starbucks busch beer pepsi to name a few with decent acting yes the pseudointellegentsia are all suckers easy prey to a little pretentiousness they identify with in making this obvious fact a little more obvious the movie was a success maybe the point was to think for yourselves in which case the only natural reaction should be complete loathing for this filmnegative,my husband talked me into this after time and time again saying i dont want to watch a movie about fighting i guess he thought the beginning was better than i thought it was i guess if you get kicks out of people whose lives are completely the dumps then watch this movie its only mildly amusing before the fighting if youre a mentally stable personnegative,note to mr pitt dark glasses and a scruffy somewhat swollen face isnt working we understand youre a male actor and im certain a good spirit with pretty much a pick of the a list in tinsletown but cut your losseskiddo golden boy aint so bad a draw heyid welcome you into my own dilapidated boudoir anytimebright yellow playtex gloves or notbut on screenkeep it simple i think girls prefer you that way too question for mr fincher are you too hip for your own good or not enough to know better i escaped with barely a bruise to my patience after an hour and ten minutesfeeling immediate relief in dusks warm radiance while fleeing homewardconvinced once more that reality is so much hipper than hollywood spends so many billions contriving it to be otherwisenegative,nothing is worse than a film that pretends to be intellectual and profound yet is really just a boring rant against society this film is just that the plot is nonexistent the story is full of holes and the only worthwhile acting is done by edward norton i still cant figure out why the main female character was even in the film this is just a transparent schizophrenic bad movie and is amazingly shallownegative,on one level this movie entertains making you laugh with sharp and witty dialogue irony and utter insanity of the plot on another level as a film  as art it fails miserably this is the kind of movie you should watch with a relative detachment because theres no reason to actually delve into the philosophy the point of the movie if there is one is simply to entertain the audience if the directorscreenwriterproducercast meant it to be deeper it got lost in the parody i will admit that i was very entertained by the performances of all the leads and even meat loaf was fun to watch in his small role however this does not make up for the fact that fight club tries to play with your mind and give a new spin on random subjects like mass media masculinityviolence and society when in fact it spreads itself too thin and through the conclusion of the movie completely sullies whatever decent arguments it had bottom line watch it for pure fun no more there is no hidden treasure herenegative,quite unfortunate i respect most of the people in this movie and they do show some good acting chops in this movie unfortunately its a pale screenplay directed with no distinction ed norton had already done a brilliant movie about fascistwannabes with american x so what was the point of getting involved in this mess norton deserved better as did pitt bonhamcarter and leto sad  i was hoping for a meditation for modern life and the culture of violence i guess ill just have to go back to american history x and natural born killersnegative,sorry but i thought this movie was so hyped up for nothing i thought it stinked maybe it doesnt deserve the 1 i gave it but i am not pleased with the high rating it has definetly not in the top 100 movies of all time are you madnegative,spoiler this is one of a few movies overrated by wannabe intellectuals the script is slick in that it disguises its propaganda propaganda you ask lets start off with the fact that edward nortons character in this movie is psychotic and brad pitts doesnt exist brad pitts character tyler durden is a figment of nortons imagination because nortons character is psychotic this whole plot twist becomes even more aggravating when you realized you wasted over two hours watching a movie about a psychotic anarchist the movies message is great for impressionable kidsnegative,that could possibly describe what this movie is awful i know most of you will disagree with me but sorry it sucked first off there is no acting in this movie you could put any actors in place of brad and edward and it would be the same but in my opinion neither of them should never win an oscar anyway for any of their works second what was going on i mean i get the story of edward trying to be someone else and all but it was told well at all it was a very dark movie saying this is the best movie of all time makes me laugh there is no way it can be if you want to argue about this let me know fight club = fnegative,the first 10 minutes made me think this was going to be a great movie worthy of the high ratings given by those on imdb however i can just barely see its value as a unique story through the lame dialogue and ridiculous plot it was too difficult of a film for me to enjoy i stuck with it but was thoroughly disappointed midway through the film good performances but other than thatcertainly no where near my top 250 filmsnegative,the first 10 minutes made me think this was going to be a great movie worthy of the high ratings given by those on imdb however i can just barely see its value as a unique story through the lame dialogue and ridiculous plot it was too difficult of a film for me to enjoy i stuck with it but was thoroughly disapointed midway through the film good performances but other than thatcertainly no where near my top 250 filmsnegative,the first half hour or so was pretty entertaining even if most of it consisted of edward norton telling us what we were seeing you know god forbid we should use our abilities to surmise whats going on and since i saw it on video i could use slomo to catch brads wheres waldo bits as soon as norton met brad it was all downhill even a really fine insightful actor would have had a hard time making those pretentious lines sound significant but brad pitts spewing of them was like a nearsighted used car dealer reading cue cards this movie was so obvious so pretentious and such a total con job right up to the absurd plot twist threequarters of the way through that completely invalidated everything that came before it also for a movie that was so preachy about consumerism you are not your car your khakis all that hackneyed nonsense did anyone else notice that all the tired young execs at fight club proper seemed to spend alot of time at the gym nary a pot belly to be found save for poor meat loaf who was somehow exempt from the no shirtno shoes rule largebreasted meat loaf fighting shirtlessnow that would have been shocking everything this movie had to say has been said before and better and sometimes just as badly see zabriskie point for another example of an overblown smug rumination on being yourself and getting back to basics vs evil products like wonder bread fight club was just a cynical exercise from a selfimportant director seeing how much he could get away withnegative,the movie is about an ordinary guy who leads an ordinary drab life trying to rise above his position near the bottom of the corporate ladder you soon find that he is an insomniac later you find that he also has another personality his other personality is an antiestablishment anticonsumer antigod antieverything uninteresting psycho the movie centers around this psychotic idiot creating an army of even stupider lowlifes to do his bidding which includes destruction of and creating chaos within our established social system the fight club is the army and it began when men decided that they got a wonderful release by inflicting and receiving pain during fights what a wonderful idea for a movie if you are a complete manic depressive psycho idiot neo nazi that is this movie is over 2 hours long and it is a shame because in my busy life i just lost over 2 hours of my weekend i kept waiting for the movie to show me its purpose this is the absolute worst movie i have ever seen i guess the writer relates to the characters i am proud to say i do not and if many people do relate to the brainwashed psycopaths in this movie then society is in big trouble this movie can only accomplish 2 things waste your time or convince really stupid people that are on the edge to blow up buildings and deliver pain i walked away from this movie angry that someone could spend $50 million making it dont waste your timenegative,there are a lot of highly talented filmmakersactors in the united states now none of them are associated with this movie why in the world do producers actually invest money in something like this this you could have made 10 good films with the budget of this garbage its not entertaining to have seven grown men running around as dorks pretending to be funny what is funny though is that the films producer who happens to be the oldest guy of the bunch is playing the youngest dork the film is filled with moments that scream for captions saying youre supposed to laugh now its hard to believe that this craps supposed to be a comedy many people actually stood up and left the cinema 30 minutes into the movie i should have done the same instead of wasting my time painnegative,there is no arguing that fight club was an allegory to 911 the taliban wanted to prove to america that its fascist capitalist socialist approach to consumerism that they would take down the buildings that were held in high regard to americans tyler durden and his schizophrenic friend brad pitts character set off to destroy the capitalist america by taking down major banks through soap bombs i dont want to go into more detail for fear that the government will take me away you can look it up on google and read the in depth analysis by people who were taken away the chicks tits were bomb even though they were cgi i liked the part where brad pitts character spliced penises into the movie reel and the 12 year old girl was crying because it was bigger than her dads make sure to check where your soap was madenegative,this film has to be different then the book i notice the production cost and theater gross are way off which is what makes the most sense of this film this makes kubricks 2001 a masterpiece criminals should have time taken off their sentence if they can sit through this more then once some great movies do need to be seen 2 or 3 times to understand everything and it is worth it obviously not this someone thought they were being real dynamic deep brilliant putting this thing together when they were on lsd it seemed like the answer to the meaning of life when they came down it was silly nonsense too late the film was in the can it belongs in an ashcan i am sure there are many people who put this in a cult classic category they are on drugs and not even watching it the film actually would have been much better if it was another underground fight movie without the way overboard trying to be deep and multi faceted art it is not the high school chemistry did nothing to help the film the subliminal message before the credits was probably aimed at people who spent money to see it you got the shaft it sucks and others which cannot be printed herenegative,this film is the one of the worst uses of celluloid ive seen no plot acting by ed norton brad i cant act pitt and others off the mark its just plain lame its herky jerkythe new way to make filmsjust film a series of crazy mixed up scenes and teenagers dig it this can only be described as a teenagers angst filmsocietys out to get me so form a fight club to strike back forget this filmunless youre 16 and feeling badnegative,this film starts off well and keeps you interested until about half way through in the second half of the film the storyline goes all over the place and when you realise whats actually going on then you realise how ridiculous it all is as a result the film loses all credibility and youre just left feeling cheated whereas with other promising bad films the problem is usually that the basic idea for the plot is good and they are simply badly executed like the sixth sense  here the main idea is absurd and is also executed badly the only good things in this film are the acting and the camerawork which is admittedly good but for a good film you need a good plot not a ridiculous one all in all very bad not worth watching and certainly doesnt deserve to be anywhere in the list of best 250 films avoid at all cost will leave you feeling disillusionednegative,this has got to be one of the most overrated movies of alltime oooh it was all in his mind how original no one has ever thought of that before obviously i am being sarcastic this movie was so boring that i could only get about halfway through it before having to stop and only later did i get around to watching the second half that was a mistake it was as utterly pointless and uninteresting in the second half as it was in the first this is a classic example of a movie being popular simply because it was trendy for people to say that they liked it and brad pitt give me a break the guy is a hack only a star because of his looks he simply cant actnegative,this highly pretentious film is written by an intellectual weakling designed for those to aspire to this the plot makes no sense and the clever finale is drivel to absorb any meaning from this would require the classic media studies student who used to not understanding and undeservedly praising most cretinous films takes this abstract twist to be a clever comment on the state of society or something of the sort in term of enjoyment fight club undoubtedly gets a 0 surely even for those supposedly engrossed in the nonsensical intricacies of it and a small role from meat loaf heightens the sense of disappointment in conjunction with a slight feeling of nausea avoid at all costsnegative,this is easily one of the worst films ever created the beginning i must admit is different and quite intriguing i mean who would have ever thought of a guy who is addicted to 12 step programs but the minute that brad pitts face hits the screen we are soon forced into mind numbing senseless violent trash i think that violence must be used for a purpose such in reserviour dogs or raging bull in these movies we see violence as a tool to push the desperation and hopelessness of the main characters in fight club we see violence as a tool to drive along a bunch of nonsense possibly the only reason i could see for all of the fights was for the male characters to bring out their pent up freudian fantasies for violence if you want an immature movie where men beat the cp out of each other for no reason then go ahead bon appetite but if you want a movie that has any intelligence or sense of reality then please do your self a favor and spend your money elsewherenegative,this is possibly the worst movie ive ever seen i hear its supposed to appeal to my generation im 22 since weve been brought up on a diet of senseless violence and mtv now i dont automatically think theres anything wrong with violence in movies as long as theres some justification for it and i like watching mtv when they actually play videos but i found this film terrible up until about the middle of the movie there might have been a chance for this movie to find itself and deliver some real social commentary which is the only possible reason other then pure sick voyeurism that might justify the horrific violence unfortunately fight club then took a turn for the worse not for the better and delivered an even more bizarre more violent ending save your money somethinganythingon tv or at the $175 movie theater is better than thisnegative,this is the worst piece of trash ive seen in many a long year ive seen comments that the movie presents the shallowness and hypocrisy of the squares all around us and offers a way out through the infliction and receipt of pain in bareknuckled brawling with consenting partners sorry i cant see it that way all i see is a tiresome and unappetizing jerk who turns into a tiresome masochist with bruises there is nothing liberating in this piece of trash there is only an inauthentic jerk who turns into a more disagreeable inauthentic jerk given that it takes a lot of money and a lot of talented people to make a movie like this its incomprehensible how this piece of trash like this ever got made and even more incomprehensible how any sane and intelligent critic could find any redeeming qualities in it if the movie demonstrates anything its that lunacy and tastelessness has taken over the inmates are in charge and were all living in a lunatic asylumnegative,this movie deliberately deceives you like with a good fraudster there are many positive aspects immaculate acting and visuals positive messages eg there is enormous potential within your self  free it good pacing a nice story twist which seems not to be based on any significant holes in the story line and abundant food for thought all this pales against what appears to be the main and effectively only concern of the movie glorification of a herrenmenschenfascistwomanhatingsadistic type of male homosexuality there is still much to improve in our societies for gay people and this movie does respective efforts not any good to say the least most disturbingly one can observe this tendency in the female lead which is cast as a sex and brainless ragdoll useful only for the release of sexual aggression which she actually likes and deserves because she is a predator posing as a pet  a role model for women in general the final scene does not imply anything else because in the end it is taylor who prevails  as can be inferred by his last spliceinnegative,this movie doesnt know exactly what it wants the movie is very slow on pace i actually like the kind of movies that first try to build the characters and make you delve into the atmosphere this movie wasnt building any character or atmosphere but what it was building is total boredom i didnt want to watch this movie till the end but then i thought about the high points that people have given it and some of the reviewers were talking about its great twist ending but the ending alone couldnt save the 90% of this movies boredom i really feel cheated i want my money and above all 139 min of my life back that i wasted on this crap my advice to you people who havent seen this movie please dont waste your valuable resources on this crapnegative,this movie is a well crafted exciting and ultimately thoughtless piece of propaganda like potemkin triumph of the will or birth of a nation it advances certain ideas that we are all slaves to consumerism and have no choice but to buy products advertised to us which we must revolt against by beating people up and exploding buildings and argues them with images rather then words in historical context it will be seen alongside the wto and imf riots and the rise of the green party like most propaganda a closer inspection will reveal how full of hypocrisy it is  notice all the product placementsnegative,this movie is not that good after seeing this movie i wouldnt ever pay cash money to see this again i will never rent this movie again i probably wouldnt watch it on tv if it came on its really that bad $350 is not worth watching this movie do not rent it it is awful my reason for this opinion is the fact that it doesnt make sense in most scenes the part where hes burning his hand is fairly impossible the ending is really bad i mean its so bad that i almost threw a flower pot at the tv screen and dont be misled by the title its not really about a fight club its about something more absurd edward norton did the best job he could with this lousy script and even brad pitt did a mediocre job the surprise ending is nothing like the sixth sense id rather see that movie twenty more times rather than see 5 minutes from fight club ive read some comments about this movie and i dont know what you guys are talking about its not that good some plot twists does not make for good movie making this movie is on the level of judge dredd no wait judge dredd isnt this badnegative,this movie is very very very times 10 to the 100th power bad i mean come on brad pit and edward norton in a fight id rather watch a pokemon fight then those two weak fruity actors fight but brad was ok in ocean 11 and 12 monkeys plus the whole plot is just way over the top it tries to appeal to a smart audience but i think it can only appeal to a dumb one this film total insults capitalism and america it tries to make some political statements but it is just a 2 hour piece of garbage i should have known better than to rent this weak movie the movie cover simply has a picture of a bar of pink soap that should have told me not to watch it but since the reviews were kind of good i rented it anyway thats the last time i watch something with a piece of pink soap on the movie covernegative,two great movies in my opinion are the game and seven both directed by david fincher so obviously i went into fight club wanting to love it and i did well the first half anyway from there on it went straight downhill into just another hollywoodproduced uncreative clonemovie i could go in and pinpoint the exact frame where the film turns from an intriguing smart drama into an unimaginitive hybrid of two of the worst movies that ive seen the matrix and dark city all three of these movies seem to have a common newage theme they all convey the message the individual can do anything and as long as they don t seek aid from an outside source their power is limitless maybe these antiestablishment  antireligion ideals are just a faze in modern media but it could also be the direction the industry will be heading in the future as for fight club on its own brad pitt and edward norton play their parts well and the movie does have some redeeming elements but overall i cant recommend it but dont let that dissuade you from seeing the movie id never say dont see this movie you should always see the movie to have an opinion of your own just watch this one with your eyes opennegative,typically overdirected david fincher nonsenseis he actually able to direct a movie that isnt dank grimy and depressing there are way to many people out there who hold this claptrap in too high regard perhaps they confuse the muddled and selfcongratulatory rubbish that is the plot for something deep and meaningful i found that this film scrapes the bottom of the barrel for reasons to be cynical and faithless it became increasingly obnoxious and irritating edward nortons character had the most annoying voice and the constant ugly imagery turned me off totally if this film wanted to poke fun at our society then why did it only show all the ugly parts granted there is a lot of fake unnatural beauty out there but a helluva lot of this world is still free and nice to look at not everywhere is a dull grey office or a miserable rainy alleyway it is also very very slow 139 minutes have never seemed so longa lot of this film could have been cut out and still there would be no major difference to the story i like the idea that everyone is part of the same gang and by sticking together they can easily bring down modern society this should have been exploited more but we only get about 4 or 5 scenes of their antics but the whole thing of the gang becoming fascists in their attempt to stop fascism is lost on me i didnt find it ironic subtle or meaningful sorry the subtext about man becoming primal again and releasing all the rage created from jobs that insult their intelligence and ruin their lives is lost on me too its practically nonexistent i have never been let down so much by a movie that was hyped as being exciting it was really rather boring the dvd has a loads of features annoying and headache inducing why did fox insist on a dozen little featurettes instead of one healthy hourlong documentary the menus are confusing as is the multiangle function on the 5minute scene deconstructions who on earth is going to watch all of these 2 or 3 times just to see the different angles and bad camcorder shots of someone working on a computer the movie itself is in dolby 51 and is anamorphically enhanced at 2401negative,uninteresting clichÃ©d look at capitalism moralism and human natureyadda yadda yadda i think the appeal to the masses must be the cool rebel element i just found that boring and senseless pitt and norton are fine and actually necessary for the film to even be watchable roger ebert said it best women who have had a lifetime of practice at dealing with little boy posturing will instinctively see through itnegative,what was this this was stupidwhat was going on i am going to warn you right now that if like me you were hoping to learn about soap by watching this movie you will be sorely disappointed their house was totally dirty and had bad electricity there was one point in this movie when i sat on the remote and accidentally changed the channel to the real housewives of new jersey and i didnt even notice its basically the same premise somebody is in front of the camera doing something and somebody else is all oh no uhhhh you cant do thathere im sorry if you liked this movie but it means that youre stupid why are you so stupid stop itnegative,when the movie was half way through all my friends wanted to turn it off i refused because i had heard it was a fantastic ending we saw the movie through but it only got worse i cant see anything uplifting about this movie id rather see the matrixnegative,why oh why do i give david fincher a second chance my mind always wanders when watching his films and pictures him at various moments over say 2 months writing his little ideas down as they come to him this movie is clearly the culmination of about 20 of those ideas and some that were brought back from the waste paper basket strung together with thread bare plotting oh and please david give your set designer the day off for the next one heshes needed at a new theme park to do the haunted house 2 out of 10 1 for the lead actors who give it there best and 1 for brad pitts bum cleavage that gave the movie its best toonegative,yes these days its hard to single out a movie as exceedingly dumb when people rave about crap like pulp fiction and the matrix but this must take a special prize at least in this case this qualifies as a so bad its good exercise whereas the others were just mindless bores of course its largely thanks to the incredibly bad acting of ed norton and brad pitt who should form a triumvirate with keanu reeves as the most overpaid talentless bunch of numbnuts ever to grace the screen with their lack of talent in fact the only good performance here is by meatloaf which is saying a lot if you think the plot is original its not the same idea was presented in a half hour episode of alfred hitchcock presents over 30 years ago that was directed by the master himself still even if it was faked i did greatly enjoy seeing pitt and norton beating each other to a bloody pulp they both certainly deserve it for their past and future worknegative,yes this movie is quite different however aside from the possibility that no ones done it before because they werent smartinspiredgood enough to theres also the other one this is a movie that fails so remarkably you almost have to be a genius to come up with such a failure in the one excellent scene in this movie edward norton flying on a plane from one of his constant business trips cracks a joke to his neighbour brad pitt aka tyler durden here very clever pitt replies how is that going for you that is both funny and poignant the rest of the movie however is neither in fact its just the same as poor ed norton  too clever for its own good worse yet is the reaction this movie seems to cause many of the others commented and other people whove seen this movie think that tyler durden is somehow the voice of good a positive role model if you will and some people are completely nuts about this movie they quote it day and night and i dont know its just weird and then theres the ending i cant give it away but the best thing that i can say about it is that it is gimmicky its also pretty implausible doesnt fit with the rest of the story and involves blowing up skyscrapers something we now know is not a very good idea if youre going to make a clever movie with a clever surprise ending fine its possible to make a good one  the usual suspects for example but having a clever movie that isnt clever enough to make sure the movie still makes any sense when the ending is revealed a clever movie whose message is how empty cleverness is a clever message movie where the message is delivered by someone whos obviously shall we say not very emotionallymentally stable to say the least i guess you could say its irony but then with the same success you can say that domestic disturbance is a movie that makes one think cause it makes you think what the heck youre doing watchingpaying for such an awful movie having said all that this is a movie that could have been partially rescued by having a lead actress who is stunningly beautiful unfortunately helena bonham carter isnt okay maybe its not the most overrated movie on imdb  after all the shwshank redemption is ranked #2 and kingpin is not even on the bottom 100 at all but its pretty close 110 and that high only cause it took so much effortnegative,yes this movie is quite different however aside from the possibility that no ones done it before because they werent

the most overrated movie on imdb  after all the shawshank redemption is ranked #2 and kingpin is not even on the bottom 100 at all but its pretty close 110 and that high only cause it took so much effortnegative,this two hour version is a terrible war movie very violent and i wouldnt want my kids to go through what we went through watching these six piles of garbage the empire strikes back 30 minute version that garry hixon put in his files after innerspace is really really a masterpiece unfortun ately disney would not allow it to actually be released i only get about 30 hits a day on my 4 videos and im sorry to say dont have the money to release too many more but theres always hope i really enjoyed the experience in 1980 but i was a dumb kid stoned on marijuana and acid the computer graphics were very avante garde at the time its definitely a love story compared to my version but is is very long and very boring there version of the force is levitation which is not the force the force is feeling it feeling it and not using the ability too often then levitation is possible thank you disney love cinderellanegative,and poor characterization as a technical achievement its a masterpiece as a work of drama its mediocre to lame the dialogue scenes were overwrought with drama much like a soap opera although instead of sappy hammond organ music we had the sappy orchestral  rising and falling on practically every syllable jackson deserves a lot of points for his technical skills but none for his artistrynegative,i dont get the point with all that 11 oscars 9 10 on imdb but what this is sensed to be something artistic some postal card landscapes and ridiculous one liners damn try to be intelligent scenes about loyalty and all there is nothing in this movie nor in the two others that can let me say it is a good movie no plot no acting no directing there is nothing in this movie and i dont post that to provoke reactions i truly think it and i dont understand to be so isolated with this point of view there are well done heroic fantasy movies like conan the barbarian that are seen like average movies and this is put on a podium i hope im not the only one it makes wanna pukenegative,i have seen a lot of movies made from computer programs lara croft etc however this computer generated cartoon beats them all no nobody really gave a great performance individually or they would have got a nomination and won it no doubt but the graphics oh man they almost looked like a real movie being shot moreover the special effects were incredible i can see why this movie won seven oscars for special effects alone i mean you have to give it to this movie it had some great special effects oh sure the acting was overdone and a bit sappy but man get a look at the special effects here i mean it won 11 oscars so i guess it must be the best film ever even though nobody from the film was acknowledged for their performance because nobody was really great in it but man the special effects here outstanding hey a billion geeks cant be wrongnegative, if you are a tolkien fan i guess this is as good as it gets for the rest of us its just another movie and a fairly peculiar one imagine star wars return of the jedi without an appearance by darth vader or the evil emperor thats what you get here a struggle between good and evil with the leaders of the evil hordes conspicuously absent its quite strange then theres the consistent theme that the better looking you are the better your character is dr king convinced me that it was the content of my character that counted not my appearance but in all three movies of this trilogy the two go together quite closely its an old hollywood theme but not particularly to be admired as for aragorn preferring arwen to eowen i suppose there is just no accounting for taste and im sure it is faithful to the author and what can one say about the seemingly endless multiple endings not very dramatic but perhaps more interesting than the usual single climactic ending so on the whole i find the return of the king a watchable film but hardly one of the greatest of all time eleven oscars i guess it must have been a bad year for movies now that you mention it theres been a lot of those in recent years negative,the story was ruined the ending was drawn out the whole movie was shot in this ridiculous this story is so epic i will pan around and everything will seem really dramatic even when there is no real action way it was like a parody of itself i can hardly believe people could find any of the worth of the novels in this self aggrandizing trilogy i only paid $3 to see this film and was wishing for my money back after what shouldve been the final scene of the movie there was this fake 10 minute ending where thousands of people simply cheered on screen it was such a blatant way of telling people the fabulous movie the tremendous trilogy is over lets all celebrate it was terriblenegative,man fellowship was much better than this piece of junk a lot of the shots were horrible the cgi except for gollum sucked the dialogue was beyond cheesy the battles were anti climatic the way the war ended w the dead people was dumb the ending dragged on and on and on i checked my watch at least 15 times during this movie the battle scenes blah and if the fate of the world is in your hands and your supposedly out numbered why freakin joke while your fighting and putting notches on your belt thats just so freakin lame the attempts at comedy in this movie were laughable if you want to watch a movie w real battle scenes do yourself a favor and go see last samurai ive seen that movie 2 times and im going to have to see it again to get the bad taste out of my mouth that is rotknegative,lord of the rings is an overlong piece of crap from one of the biggest hacks in hollywood peter jackson used to make low budget horror films that were amazing now he makes big hollywood movies with big hollywood stars his aim now isnt to make good movies his aim is now to make as much money as he can why cant hollywood start making films that are actually good instead of films that they make to reel in cash who needs so much money why does peter jackson need more money seriously peter jackson needs to stop making movies he ruined king kong recently and he made three films that are entirely too long based on a crappy overlong series get this film off the top 250 of all time it sucksnegative,without the use of computer graphics this film would not be worth the price of a cheap bargain day 3 for 1 special rental at the local video store true the locations and cinematography add to the film however heaven forbid that the cast should either have to act or in the case of the veteran actors overact cg removed and this thespian in name only grouping are woefully short of the depth and quality characterization brought forth in the classic book the direction is sporadic and the pace is inconsistent leaving little to the imagination why so much of the budget was spent on computer technicians instead of acting lessons sorry for all those who jumped on the lemming band wagon for this one but lift your heads above middle earth and return to the land of the livingnegative,theres nothing deep or important going on here so a critique of this film is almost unnecessary what passes for quality film making is nothing more than an overproduced loud stunning imax experiment in eye candy that masks once again a slowly moving thin story line obviously the members of sag have dispensed with background checks on film editors theres enough slow motion footage here to circumnavigate the globe twice many people will be amazed by the neverending in your face action sequences but for those who still pine to see the actors perform also youd better search elsewhere its like trying to read the latin version of war and peace while simultaneously being pulverized inside a blender and if having way too many computerized fight scenes forced down your throat wasnt enough just wait the full ninety hours for the saccharine glazed overlit endings and there are at least 5 of them for a while i was expectin obi wan kenobis ghost to show up and smile goodbye and cate blanchett never looked so vapid its brass tacky loud long obvious schlock and thus hugely popular beautiful looking rarely translates to quality in content and this is a prime example giving so many awards to this fillibuster is just a waste of gold plating negative,if you make your way through the thousands of teens lord of the rings junkies and all the others who voted this movie a 10 for reasons other than a pure movie rating youll find that this is easily the weakest of the three films unfortunately pro it was a good movie and for the most part entertaining the characters are well cast the cgi is good in most places the actors are good enough to save questionable editing and the scenery is still breathtaking great effects in battle youll see worth the $10 to see but not really one you want to see again without having the ability to skip portions cons 1 way way too long and poor editing choices spoiler the multiple endings was totally preposterous and belongs in the extended dvd version for fanzies remember this is a movie not the book that time would have been much better spent on main characters that never surfaced eg saruman whom you never saw again and sauron who was reduced to nothing more than a lighthouse oh yeah i felt how dangerous he was you will get restless at the end of the movie and will laugh your head off as to how awfully campy and forced it feels especially when frodo wakes up and the silly canned laughter begins 2 too much time wasted at the beginning of the film as well mr jackson pick your choices of what to develop the love story and relationship between get any concern for the relationship too bad too much crap with merry and pippin please enough of the hobbit details crap and focus on the main characters honestly i didnt feel like i really cared so much about many of the characters because there was so much cutting between scenes and an incredible amount of time spent on faramir and his going mad father an odd area to place so much time 3 gimli and legolas again reduced to nothing more than comic relief and incredibly cool and unrealistic cgi hero there was practically no dialogue with legolas at all the reduction of these characters made me care less about legolas and made the girl i went with happy the one or two time she saw him but wondered why he was nothing but occasional screen candy 4 the movie felt very tired gollum again steals the show 5 some of the battle scenes were tired a lot of quick cutaways and not as much feel of the one on one combat like you had in the first films also very very poor display assistance of the dead it was as though they used up the budget for cgi and had this wave of green just end the huge number of saurons army in 10 seconds while the other characters hung out to chat it was like a comic strip video game honestly i didnt feel like i really cared so much about the characters at the end and felt like the ring was reduced to nothing more than an overblown reason to have a quest i truly think this movie suffers from wasted time at the beginning and end too many battle scenes and too little time to continue to develop the great dialogue and character development of earlier movies my rating would place this film a very good 75 but that is as high as id go definitely bring some nourishment wear comfy clothes and a watchnegative,if the first film bored you to tears and the second one bored you to death the third film will not affect you because you are now numb and totally disinterested we have even more of those pointless scenes with sam and frodo more battles and more cgi and how many endings can a film have theres a huge battle and then they tell you there is another one and its still not over because there are a million loose ends and then they go back home and then bilbo leaves home and then sam has children is that the end or is there more i cant even remember i fell asleep during one of the particularly tedious scenes with sam and frodo this is not a film its a pointless sequence of scenes and an exercise in cgi that resembles a video game one you can only watch but not play and i still dont care about a single bloody character in this filmnegative, this film is bad in the sense that it is hardly a film at all it has no structure no dialogue no screenplay a threadbare story but one that is not told because of non existent direction etc it continues where the original left off and just notches off plot elements one by one without any urge to tell a story or develop characters relationships etc the makers probably conceived this as a filler between numbers one and three and didnt bother with it of course thats all right i dont have any problem with that but what really does disturb me is the high praise meted out to this film from almost every quarter ‰ÛÒ from viewers and critics alike on this board its being rated as the 17th best movie of all time ive consulted quite a few film guides and they all tag maximum or near maximum stars to this film even more bizarrely they consider it to be the best of the series and in my mind its clearly the worst what is going on of course its not difficult to see why this film is idolized the first film was both good and a milestone not great but it was the perfect statement for an age it was a fairy tale that was confused as science fiction the force embodied morality even religion for the space age it is set in the distant past and therefore pertains to origins rather than where technology is going spaceships and laser guns are just the backdrop and have nothing to do with the story or the subject matter when this film appeared in the middle of the crisis ridden seventies it really must have been a beacon of new hope and to put the ground breaking special effects into its proper context they symbolized optimism there is no doubt that the effects served the story well but they served even better the mood of the age and with all this going star wars rightly became a tremendous hit and the focus of fanatic devotion it was to be expected that any sequel would have been gobbled up by the fan base as long as it didnt spoil the original empire doesnt spoil the original it not only continues the war between good and evil it does so with more spectacle more aplomb more special effects when people say they like empire what i think they really mean is that thy like star wars so much that they are thrilled that it has a new and glossy wrapping because empire is nothing but embellishment theyre not judging the film itself the ideal situation would have been if star wars remained as a standalone fairy tale fairy tales end and they leave us with the aura of happily ever after they dont go on and on and become sagas and if they did that would totally destroy the aura empire is the first mistaken step towards saga and that is why it quickly finds itself out of its depth there is nothing else to be told and thats why the film is so bad one boring battle joined to another boring battle and in between we have cardboard characters mouthing atrocious dialogue that serves no purpose whatsoever the strain tells everybody is straining to do something when there is nothing to do the third film the return of the jedi redeems itself by trying to finish a story the prequels are interesting because they are filling in the background but empire is caught in no mans land it is bad and it should be exposed as such all this pretending isnt healthy i dont think negative,obviously this was a faithless and pointless butchering of the novel but whats worse a terrible movie lacking flow sense linearity and dramatic impact this played out like a highlights reel not a coherent story the actors did an admirable job with the awful dialogue and nosensical personalities they were given with some exceptions peter jacksons only two abilities seem to lie in super close up and super wide out shots both of which are heartily abused and the special effects for the most part would have been better served by a cardboard set and some directing ability there were high points but this was and is the first and only movie i have ever left before the end and they barely kept me there but for the eowyn nazgul scene a hollywood blockbuster no doubt a good movie hell no possessing anything in common with the literature it is supposedly based on the fact is if this were based on real events i dont think the people involved would have given them to right to use their real names maybe that wouldnt be such a big deal if i didnt have to hear about jacksons love of the books or read reviews that discuss staying true to the source material there is hardly a scene or underlying theme in the movie that has anything to do with the books this movie could probably have been worse but i would be hard pressed to know hownegative,talk about a bad mainstream movie bad acting and terrible choices of scenes to have in the movie by peter jackson its a shame its on the 2th place when great movies like lost in translation is much further down sure the movie contains some really great effects and some okay acting but i mean the end oh my god was it really necessary to have 4 ending scenes if you still like these kind of movies why dont you guys go and see star wars at least their acting and characters is a lot more fun and those movies are also contains nice scenes relating to the time they were made this shouldnt be seen as an offense to either peter jackson nor tolkien because they are both great but still the movie didnt really work out ickashnegative, okay i realize that this movie is considered by many to be a great film i understand that they are extremely faithful to the novels and this pleases many fans what i do not understand is how anyone can say this film is better than the godfather ii and even one spot away from the first godfather go take a gander at the imdbs top 250 and youll see that this movie is only marginally below the shawshank redemption i mean cmon someones gotta figure out a way to balance the rating system here all thats going on is these movies cult of scary and weird followers sit in their dank cold basements on the internet and vote these films a 10 when in the grand scheme of things theyre really more of a 6 7 or maybe an 8 im sorry but no matter how great these movies may seem theyre little more than a cgi fest of monsters armies and magical beams this film cant hold a candle to the intense drama of michael corleones criminal empire holding power in 1950s las vegas cmon imdb viewers lets keep the ratings reasonable negative,this movie is not great its barley border line good the only two reason i cant think this was rated so high was the extremely high budget on 3d animation and the fact that people are so easily enticed by the name and actors now i am not insulting the books as i have never read them but other than what i stated what makes this movie so great is it the acting i dont really think orlando bloom can preform any other role take a look at both the lord of the rings and pirates of the caribbean is it climax i think even the people who didnt even read the book knew that from the first half of the first movie knew that the ring would be destroyed is it the characters it had all the basic characters for all movie storyline the only entertaining and not bland character was golem what is it that makes you think its in the league with schindlers list and casablanca i dont claim to know what the best movie ever is but i know this movie dose not rank high in greatness it only high in its budget negative,not being a dork or geek the mystique of these movies are lost on me so here is a review from someone that actually had dates in high school and didnt play d&d every friday night long lame sword fights to win a sword fight with the orcs all you need to so is step aside and cut them across the chest then as an alternate you can spin and run your opponent through i figure me and four other people could effectively wipe out a million of these lame fighters for this reason alone i give the movie a thumbs down the special effects were perhaps the best ive ever seen great monsters and landscapes is it just me or were most of the characters in this story gay just look at the way froddo looks at sam and vice versa pure lust in their eyes then there was this albino vulcan who always made double entandres toward a midget with a big nose he was obviously gay then there was the way gondorf kept touching the hobbits is this guy a priest anyway i give this movie a thumbs down it had the longest ending of any movie ive seen people were saying it it over yet but no it kept on going and going like the energizer easter bunny peter jackson is purely b list in my opinion there thats from a cool guy later negative,this film won 11 oscars including best picture the return of the king is an awful film at well over three hours it is an exercise in boredom orlando bloom and viggo moretensen are completely miscast the story does not make sense and the characters are contrived it is like playing a bad video game so many actors are wasted in this colassal disaster peter jackson winner of the best director academy award seems as though he thought that his film was too precious to edit the film goes on and on and on weak acting all around the film relies on special effects to cover for a script that is completely pretentious the musical  is like listening to someone scratching a chalkboardnegative,this movie was terrible long and boring both my wife and i hated it i love star wars the old ones i am told i am just not a fantasy fan but i think i am just not a fan of badly done commercialized fantasy if i want to see a documentary on new zeland landscape i will rent it the movie should tell a compelling story with 20 characters and none of them even close to well developed i had no attachment to any of them yes i did not read the books i actually read the hobbit as a kid and loved it and remember it well i think they were just too true to the books and didnt realize that the books dont make a good movie unless you have read and loved the books call me the grinch i am not harsh on most movies all my friends love this movie and are avid fans i have no idea how it is anywhere in the top 250 maybe i could say this is a decent flick if you have nothing mildly stimulating to watch some weekend or need a decent rental my wife walked out of this movie i bared through it in the theaters just to give it a chance i would never rent it dont bother dragonslayer from back in the day does it much better and with triple the drama and action negative,while the first two films of the trilogy where very good in my opinion the third one is a complete catastrophe in every aspect one can think of its attitude towards the book and without the book no one would have heard of peter jackson except few admirers moves between insult to ignorance almost no text from the original survives and the characters and scenes are terribly distorted even the climax scene is changed from the genius of tolkien to a bad holiwoodic clich‹© the most disastrous is what the movie does to the character of frodo which from the original tragic hero becomes a stupid and gullible fellow which does nothing expect stupid things the go home sam scene should be candidate to one of the worse movie scenes ever other characters such as denethor faramir aragorn theoden or elrond are either inconsistent irrational stupid badly acted or all of the above in addition unlike the beautiful design of the middle earth in general in the first movie or of rohan in second there is nothing left from gondor except one picture of minas tirith and few fires it amazes me that not only this film is considered excellent by many viewers but that it is considered the best of the three negative,i went to see rotk for the 2nd time yesterday and aside from the myriad of minor flaws want to concentrate on major issues surrounding jacksons character development aragorn is the first big problem in the book he is both a ranger from the north but also a man destined to be king he knows who he is and he has an expectation of that destiny likewise in the book he has spiritual awareness aragorn is descended not merely from men but from numenor so he already has in him some of the blood of the elves now jackson gives all foresight to the elves making the men merely men but the whole point is that the man born to be king has the spiritual awareness of the great kings of old thus in book ii at the river it is aragorn not legolas as in jacksons version who is aware of a shadow growing in his heart and more significantly it is aragorn who in the book takes the palantir by his right gandalf actually bows to give it to him gandalf counsels him not to use it but aragorn knows who he is so he looks in the palantir and shows sauron the sword he challenges sauron and then wrenches the palantir away from the eye to use as he wills not as sauron wills in so doing he sees the black fleet and so knows the threat thats why he takes the path of the dead and when he goes under the dimholt he really summons the dead the exchange in the film between aragorn and the geoffrey rush pirates of the caribbean look alike ghost is feeble in the film in the book aragorn does not doubt who he is he calls them not barters with them now aragorns action here is part of a much larger cohesion in tolkien that is entirely absent in jackson as a result were left with a desperately anti climactic coronation why theres simply been no character development of aragorn hes been denuded of a sense of who he is sauron is the next big problem its true that in the book he is mostly referred to as the eye but he also has personality in the film apart from the opening sequence to film i which was brilliant all we have is a plasma lamp sometime searchlight since in the book gandalf has told frodo that sauron is taking shape again why on earth didnt jackson then develop sauron from the figure in film i in the book we are told of saurons gnawing doubt we hear of reports about spies entering mordor we know that he is consumed by fear of the upstart heir of elendil none of this is developed in the film and the ring seems to lose power on entering mordor not gain it result there was no sense of elation at the fall of baraddur now this is a serious theological error that i suspect tolkien would have detested personify good and you must also personify evil tolkiens epic was all about those forces being personified and how you discern them sauron is a personification of evil hes not actually the worst that belongs to morgoth of whom the balrog is a servant whilst tolkien rightly loathed allegory he nonetheless never would have countenanced such a weak and ineffectual portrayal of the enemy the whole point and if this isnt obvious in the world today then jackson is even less astute than i imagined is that evil in many guises takes human form others the same lack of characterisation in aragorn and sauron goes on with many of the others notable exceptions are gandalf and saruman both well acted jackson made a mistake in cutting saruman out of iii having made so much of him in i and ii more than the book arwen is drippy throughout eowyn is changed in the film miranda otto was excellent but jackson plays up the love between her and aragorn so much that we are left wondering how eowyn is apparently beatifically happy to see him with arwen on the subject of eowyn its such a shame jackson didnt do the slaying of the witch king better in the book the battlefield pauses a cloud goes up and everyone in minas tirith is happy its one of the truly great moments lost by jackson the reports even leak back to the orcs in the tower above shelobs lair so that sam and frodo hear that no1 has been done in as for the hobbits i think this may be a question of preference personally i think sean astins acting as sam is execrable but some like it for me the simple gardener becomes a mini philosopher and i find his soliloquy both at the end of film ii in osgiliath to which they never go in the book and on the mountain twice truly toe curlingly dreadful pap im afraid and oh dear we even veered towards titanic music moments at the end of film i and again on the mountain bilbo was fine until the end yes we know he ages fast now hes lost the ring but the salieri style prosthetics are poor jackson loves the slow motion work so much that we have to endure some particularly dreadful sequences with the hobbits most notably the already infamous bed scene and at the end where i really thought frodo was going to give sam a full on smacker a similarly tacky piece of directing occurs when the elves appear the soft focus lens is deployed with celtic singing argh this is kindergarten film production i expect the film will garner the oscars ceremony but i hope some people in tinsel town have the courage to acknowledge that whilst some of the visuals are outstanding though many are not eg the oliphaunt descent by legolas the merrick style leader of the orcs and the army of the dead the film is not actually very good peter im afraid youve let us and jrr tolkien downnegative,many people justify jacksons drivel by saying that everyone interprets the books differently jackson however not only adapted tolkiens story but created his own he removed tolkiens dialogue and replaced it with hackneyed banter he replaced scenes of drama and suspense with slapstick and hamboning the majesty and dignity of characters such as gimli aragorn sam frodo gollum and theoden almost all the characters really are reduced to snivelling whimpering and slapstick jokes arwen elrond and galadriel the most noble characters in the series are reduced to whimpering fools the disrespect that jackson shows for the characters makes clear the lack of interest he has in faithfully presenting tolkiens work tolkien after all related to his characters so closely that he had their names engraved on his own tombstone it is insulting to tolkiens memory to deal with his characters with such irreverence considering how much he cared about them its insulting to tolkiens memory while many dispute this i find the movies to be amateurish and the special effects are mediocre considering the heights of computer generated effects that other studios have reacheddespite the rave reviews it gets making a mediocre movie isnt really a sin in itself making a bad movie and claiming that it has any relationship to tolkiens work however is movie gets one star out of ten but its more deserving of zero that people have read tolkiens book and yet find any similarity or value in jacksons movies baffles me they are without merit being poorly made and completely disrespectfully adapted from the books jackson has not merely spit on tolkiens grave he has forever tainted his legacy with his awful interpretation of his work negative,this middle oddity is a very laborious experience indeed its all life saver battles with an added dose of averageness thrown in to pad it out a bit dirk vader is seeking luke shytalker or whatever his name is its something along those lines anyway because he wants to cut him down with a swift blow from his life saver if he does not join him in wanting to rule the galaxy as dull and duller maniacal space duo anyway it all ends with dirk confronting shytalker in a life saver battle to the death dirk swings his life saver at shytalker shytalker swings his life saver back at dirk this goes on until either shytalker gets his hand cut off or the audience dont care anymore thats about it really not much here for real fans empire is nowhere near as good as its predecessor or indeed its sequel jedi both of which are truly engaging this one is notnegative,many critics cite the 1952 film the greatest show of earth as the poorest best picture selection in academy history that dubious distinction should now go to lord of the rings the return of the king which makes demilles circus epic seem like the greatest show on earth in comparison it was not only the academy but also the once relevant new york film critics circle that chose this film as the years best its a wonder that the ghost of pauline kael didnt use her after life influence with the all mighty to strike the entire group dead this video game like film goes from one chase scene to the next with little in the way of plot development ive seen all three films and dont have a clue what the fellowship of the ring is or the significance of the two towers nor where the king was returning from director jackson failed to include much in the way of plot exposition in nine plus hours of film the computer generated gollum was the most interesting character in the film at least he wanted to kill off those annoying hobbits ian mckellen is distinguished in his knightly role and added a touch of class to the otherwise endless stream of special effects the female stars of the film tyler and blanchett have so little screen time that it doesnt make sense to even have them in the film apparently tylers character is present merely to suggest that mortensens character is heterosexual why blanchett has such an annoying smile on her face each fifteen seconds she is on screen is a mystery to menegative,amazing special effects have been used to mask peter jacksons mangling of the original plotline and script warning this film is a prime example of a brilliant book being americanised ie hammered into the boy meets girl girl loses boy boy and girl reunite format it has a couple of elvish words thrown in to preserve an illusion of adhering to the original book but with aragorns american accent often intruding this performance is hardly spell bindingnegative,bad acting ok story for the fans but i dont fancy this rpg trend crap i dont know how this movie ever entered the top250 movies of imdb should be ranked #500 best movie of all time or less my real grade for this movie is 60 but i voted it a 10 because lots of mindless people voted it a 10 and no way this boring movie is a 10 special effects dont make a movie a 10 out of 10 go watch the other movies on top10 list like godfather and shawshank redemption and then try to compare it with this piece of negative,okay gandalf aragorn frodo are killed in the first ten minutes and sauron is king again that would be a good ending but no it drags on for another 3 hours and in the end everything is well and all goals are reached in between there are many fighting scenes where you easely get confused who is fighting against who and what exactly for the fighting is overdone and in all battles the good guys win boring and predictable the strongest warrior of the bad guys is defeated by an average female warrior it could do with some more drama it is evident from all 3 movies together that its a story about the eternal fight between good and bad but in these movies its never really explained why exactly the bad guys hate the good guys whats even more disturbing is the facial features of the bad vs the groomed faces of the good guys as if the storyline itself simply wasnt strong enough to outline that they are really evil the orcs have disfigured faces disfigured teeth drool and have a hissing voice couldnt jackon portray that a little bit more subtile frodo is attacked by a giant spider who has surprise surprise also a deformed face and only one eye on the left side of the head is this done to make sure 3 year old infants cannot mistake who is the scary bad guy it was ridiculous to see in fact i had trouble hating them at all i just felt sorry for them i understand its a family movie but this blatant deforming is an insult to the intelligence of people then theres the plot and the story it doesnt make any sense theres no explanation why faramir father wants to kill himself and his son or why gandalf or aragorn do not take the ring to mordor but trust it to little frodo who does nothing but squeel cry and hug sam in between why did the fellowship decide to break up and let frodo continue alone with sam while the other stronger fellows try to save peppin and merrin on with this movie gandalf and aragorn guess frodo must be close to his end goal in mordor but is held up by saurons watching eye so decide to launch a distracting attack with the last army the good guys have left what if frodo happened to appear a few hours later or a few days and sauron itself was a huge warrior in movie 1 but now only a flame on a tower why do the thousands of orcs stop fighting when the tower crumble they flee but where to it is just too unbelievable stupid in movie one thousands of orc chase the fellowship in moria only inches away but none of them harm frodo or manage to catch them in movie 2 they ride with 5 horses through 10000 orcs without so much as a scratch in movie 3 gandalf fights the orcs in mordor but suddenly stops for a moment of musing and while the fighting around him continues not an orc touches him or buries his sword in gandalfs white hair ive seen c class horrors that made more sense then theres the last 20 minutes frodo destroyed the ring but the end simply goes on and on and on and on lots of tear jerking twists appear and you simply start shouting please end to the tv screen in utter annoyance no this movie may have won all academy awards it was nominated for but it was a terrible terrible series the thing that saved this last part a little bit was the helicopter view scenery but if i wanna watch helicopter view scenery ill watch national geographic even the epic battles gave me a feeling of been there done that star wars gladiator ben hur they all done the same and most of the time better shot directed edited and more importantly more believable and the directing was awful the cinematography boring and predictable the editing confusing the  predictable the storyline infantile the acting without any exception terrible the lenght insane the events too much for fantasy the cgi effects hokey it is a childs movie a la jungle book it belongs on nickelodeon between spongebob and johnny bravo in fact there oughta be a law against peter jackson movies i said borefest in the summary but that was too kind its a nice series when you are a child but its outright trash if youre an adult the one aspect that made this one better than the other 2 movies is that there is finally and end to the endless walking and talking the ring is destroyed peter jacksons mega project too thankfullynegative,what an over rated pile of toss oooooooooooh look at the effects oooooooh gollum is so real ooooooooooh id love to have long blond hair and pointy ears shut up you fools why cant people just watch excellent films and appreciate them instead of being tossed around by the wild current of sensationalism and hype all three of the films were at best average adaptations of the book but just because this is the last one it gets the highest rating its a travesty that rubbish like this overtakes actual classic films on an otherwise excellent database and dont get me started on star wars this is fantastic nonsense over produced and under thought bad taste is a far superior film stick with schlock horror jacksonand learn how to tie a tienegative,this movie is awful the ending was longer than any battle scene the entire final battle was completely meaningless the humans might as well have stood there because the only ones that did any fighting were the ghosts very anti climatic and the ending was about 35 minutes too long even the most hardcore of fans has to agree on those two points the only good part about this movie was the final battle it seemed and then the ghosts came and completely dominated everything therefore making the previous half hour meaningless i want my 3 hours of my life back and also my ten bucks in all the action was meaningless and the movie would have been much better had it been about 2 hours long topsnegative, not the strongest of the trilogy a lengthy drawn out conclusion it lacks the heart of the previous two and lapses on awkwardly with trivial and extraneous characters while he focus obviously should have been elsewhere i especially despised that tacky girlpower bit just goes to show directors actually can drag out irrelevant tacked on plot pieces and the ignorant hordes call it epic because hey its really longyou can pee 3 times get popcorn and soda refillsanswer your pagerand not miss anything most of the dialog is redundant expectancies of the end its got to end right however tediously and it is tedious with proper editing this movie could have been condensed into an hour butguess what the whole trilogys been padded so extensively for length so you can pay to see 3 not just 2 filmsits most obvious in this one wow this passes for classic negative,i think it is the worst film ive seen in a long time and ive seen the original star warsthe characters are so annoying and i wished they all died at the end of the film i wised orlando blooms character legalos would be shot in the face with an arrow by lurtz also i think aragon should get a hair cut and have a shave because ll you see is hair also what is up with that little guy gimli he is so annoying he makes little jokes which are not even funny during a supposedly serious film the group always overact about everything what is the point of leglos saying blood has been spilt this night and walking right up to the camera this look very mincy how did it win best film award how did it win any awardalso the other two films were just as bad they could have cut the films lengths by half if they did not put in so much pointless chatter it would also help if they had real actors and did not rely on cgi so much negative,the whole trilogy achieves to translate admirably well the deep boringness of the book replacing infinite descriptions with long empty tired repetitious and over emotional sequences totally misplaced considering the britney spears like deepness of characters characters are so flat and numerous that you waste half of the movie trying to remember who is who but it doesnt really matter anyway actions sometimes come to wake you up they are mostly entertaining but the most decisive and very awaited one is reduced to a game like greenish flow that is the only thing that happens to be fast in the whole movie be happy the end is near should be rated 5 to 7negative,i dont know what the academy was thinking when it gave the return of the king those 11 awards it did not deserve a single one especially best picture lost in translation mystic river cold mountain and even seabiscuit were all far better those films actually had depth and meaning where as the lord of the rings is just like titanic a bunch of shotty acting and film making covered up with tons of high budget special effects neither film deserved their awards and both in my view are among the most overrated and crappiest films in history i wish the academy would stop choosing the films that are the most popular or will give them the greatest approval ratingnegative,its an okay film epic and all of course the fact that its an epic like gladiator or troy doesnt mean its good troy proved that fact and alexander continued to prove it with one star antics to be quite frank peter jackson is an overrated director much like the lord of the rings movies are overrated movies if you notice all three are located in the top fifteen films this one happens to be ranked higher than greatly superiour films such as seven samurai schindlers list and even casablanca this is not the case with camera angles that make you sick utilising the admittedly beautiful landscape of new zealand to help push across into our heads the true epic feeling of middle earth but wait where are the interesting characters every one of them you feel so bored with by the time the first film is up you seem to hope that theyd be dead by the second one but no they come along to the third one to kick some sauron ass heres my view of lord of the rings a whole load of walking lord of the rings fellowship of the ring points there walks lord of the rings the two towers points there walks trips up walks on lord of the rings return of the king points there walks throws ring into mountain walks away take those completely identical scenarios and pile them up with useless plot for three to four hours per movie depending on which one you watch and i myself wouldnt touch the extended versions you really get the idea that the academy awards truly are flawed why look forrest gump won best film of 1994 instead of the shawshank redemption or pulp fiction titanic won best film of 1997 instead of la confidential and why lookey here lotr rotk won best ing film of 2003 instead of mystic river perhaps next year well have the constant gardener as the best film of 2005 that may actually redeem the oscars failing reputation a reputation that had truly fallen when they took this half arsed effort of a movie and worshipped it as best film negative,worse dead movie it is unsatisfactory unethical things it does to your feelings not a good realization of science fiction dumb characters i have seen many good movies my expectation was that this movie would be good but it is not complete waste of time nothing i promise you get from it baseless ambivalent matters runs through the movie i hate and would rate is as the worst one the robot talks too much unnecessary junk talks the monk was not a necessary character disappointed with the relations of princess movie made her unattractivenegative, ive waited three years for a disappointing ending the scouring of the shire wasnt in the film and that was by far the most important scene in the story with saruman and wormtongue okay so maybe its in the second dvd comes out after the regular one gets bought up but this is just a marketing scheme the exploitation of a fine story this proves once and for all that literary adaptations are a true rip off of the authors intent fixed only on making large sums of money tolkien is no doubt rolling over in his grave people against this argument no doubt say that well yes but it brings the story to the masses why not encourage them to read instead i feel that the imagination of millions of kids is now ruined because they will never be able to read the books without having wood in their minds as frodo or astin as sam and the characters dont act that way in the book and how can we justify jacksons liberal treatment of the story to promote cgi graphics while disregarding the characters in the film basically the computer is now a character these books should have been left alone this isnt the best film of all time it is the best example of exploitation that has thus far been imagined negative,as someone who read the lord of the rings 15 years back and has been re reading it ever since the movie just takes too many liberties with the plot the scriptwriters have introduced many twists that destroy the story and im sure tolkien would have been horrified if he ever saw this all in all a good action movie but really ruined by some very lousy scriptwriting plot deviations include the entire return to the shire is omitted so as to show the movie concluding with the defeat of sauron which just removes probably the most tragic part of the book frodo manipulated by gollum asks sam to leave him and go home in the climb to shelobs lair faramir decides to take frodo and sam to osgiliathout of nowhere where did the scriptwriters dream this up from and many others too numerous to mention such as tom bombadils scenes being assigned to treebeard awfulnegative,this has to be the most over rated movie ever what a disappointing year first t 3 then matrix revolutions and now return of the king i guess we will never see a 3rd movie better than the first two movies the same thing happened with star wars godfather and plenty of others so its no big deal its a curse thats what it is the two towers was perfect compared to rotk oh my god how boring this movie is pj could easily have edited and cut out 1 hour of footage which is completely irrelevant only makes you yawn oh well send lots of hate mail to me now negative,i dont wish to offend any one but to protect the integrity of the rating system honestly if you enjoyed the film it was more because you read the books and have been avid about the story for a few decades than it was its cinematic quality im sure it was wonderful for what it was but people was it really the second best movie ever released saying that the return of the king was of better quality than network dr strange love or any of the greats is naive its story is not its so if you voted so highly for its story than you were voting for the book visually impressive but think about the pictures budget so what was it than it was unoriginal and certainly not worthy of second best film on imdbnegative,i sat through this movie yesterday the special effects and the visuals were great as in the previous two parts they are pretty much what you would expect after reading the books which i did a long time ago ok so everything looks nice but otherwise the movies had little to offer i do not want to bash the movies too much because they made such a good effort in illustrating the books so this will be brief some of the problems were that the characters are very thin the dialogue is terrible and the music mediocre at best the movies also have this tendency of just marching through the obligatory plot events at a rapid pace therefore while sitting through the movies i noticed i really did not care what happens to these creatures we are for example supposed to like the good guys because they are so beautiful handsome as opposed to the ugly bad guys and because we are told they are great but there is hardly any screen time for them to demonstrate any of these good characteristics as persons except for their nice manners compared with those of the bad guys i guess a 300 hour tv series might have been a much better format to fully present the material as long as they would fix the dialogue and the music but that would have been impossible negative,yeah great looking but really boring boring and boring movie giving such a great ratings for this masterpiece is eating the top movie list since this really isnt great movie just nice arts etc but nothing more the first two were even better than this one this is all just about how great effects they can make for movie but well maybe people like this kind of movies nowadays i want more in movies not just good looking movies but good movies have to say im generally disappointed movies nowadays most of movies are just about how they look not about writing characters etc good that some does like this movie but i really dont last 30 40minutes i were just eating popcorn and thinking about my next days program 4 10 negative,i know all the fans of the books loved the lotr movies but i never could stomach the books never got more than 125 pages into the first one even though i tired a dozen times the books were tremendously dull and uninspired the movies were very true to this vision think about it for a few minutes what exactly happened over the course of about 10 hours of film a few creatures went for a walk with some computer animated battles along the way big whoop dull bored me to sleep if i could write ten lines about how dull this movie series was i might inspire you readers to the same amount of dis interest that these movies make arise in me i was enthralled by a lot of the scenery shots but the dull color palette used in most of the scenes was just as unappealing as the dull plot im not going to bother comparing this to another series of movies because i cant think of another instance of such patently dull movies being so universally heralded i wish some really good books would be afforded the lavish treatment these dry tomes got negative,a great film sorely let down by the ending i know jackson is only trying to stick to tolkiens version but the ending was unsuited for a film it just dragged on and on and on it really soured my experience of what otherwise was a great trilogy the interminable ending should have been resigned to a directors cut dvd version to satisfy tolkien fans the worst ending ever ai of course negative,the lord of the rings return of the king is certainly this centurys masterpiece it has everything that a person could want in a film it has an amazing story impressive special effects top quality acting and some of the best cinematography of the past years it will scare you it will make you cry it will make you laugh and jump with joy and gasp at the immense scale of the epic tale this is the film that over ran films such as star wars and citizen kane as everyone in the world should be made to watch it it is a film that will be around for hundreds of years and will continue to amaze people even then a truly amazing filmnegative,it sucked big time spoiler at least one of the midgets should have died nothing worthy of a message in thinking that luck will get you to your goals and other people will have to pay for your incompetence the movie is excruciating and super long most overrated franchise of all time why does any character has to cry that much on a non drama flick i miss rudy playing semi tough roles i cant believe the so called weighted average allows all the fat misfits to place every geeky franchise of films inside the top 250 its pretty frustrating and disappointing any movie that has any association with comic con should automatically receive 2 or 3 full points decrease out of the  i think thats it dont watch this movie or anything from the franchise and specifically get away of the lord of the rings prequels that are even slower with half the battles and boring negative,this was the dullest film of the 65 films i have seen all year it took an age to get going after 90 minutes many people in the theater simply got up and walked out the rest were asleep i personally demanded and got my money back if people develop dvt through sitting through this then peter jackson should watch out what happened in the gollum effects department between two towers and this entry for the first few minutes that he appeared he looked like he was made of clay or silly putty dreadful effects i also find the actors in these lord of the rings movies to be totally unengaging and uncharismatic in the end i was willing frodo to die because i got fed up of his constant whining peter jackson made a big mistake dropping christopher lee from these films as he was the only one to bring any level of class to them and was sorely missed lord of the rings will never be remembered as fondly as the original star wars trilogy simply because it is unremarkable and unmemorablenegative,how anyone can rate any one of these movies very high is perplexing this is like fodder for the middle american masses lengthy boring scenes of mediocre effects and dumb costumes the monkey suit takes the cake and sums up the whole mess terrible acting wow they found someone who is actually worse than harrison ford lucas using joesph cambell to lend credibility to this crap was a sin i wonder how much money was spent on joe to get him on the sw wagon ok so it is a harmless movie and some people apparently like it but come on better than american beauty or being john malkevich or spirits of the dead or any monty python movie etc etc etc oh well enjoy it negative, it will put you asleep because of how slow it moves now its not that i don not like 3 hours+ long movies i mean my favorite movie is once upon a time in america its just that lord of the ring the return of the king breaks the record for slowest moving movie half of the movie is just frodo and his friend sam trying to find some type of volcano to throw the ring and destroy it before gollum can get a hand on it the other half is just this big huge battle being fought now you expect a battle to give be action packed and give you an adrenaline rush but this movie does the complete opposite because of how slow it moves and how lame the few battles that are fought end it is a complete waist of time and you should only watch this movie if you have trouble sleeping at night because it will put you to sleep after the first few scenes i am still ashamed of the academy for giving this movie 11 oscars and i am still wondering how it did not win any razzie awards negative, first the good things this people who made this movie really tried and put effort into what they were doing they get an a for effort maybe they tried too hard the good things about this movie come from the book the story the inspiration every good line every good scene what the movie brings to this story is not good it manages to make each chapter into a long drawn out mess its tiring to watch a super close up of some heroic figure speak a overly dramatic line delivered in some pseudo shakespearean delivery again and again watching elijah wood furrow his eyebrows for 2 hours almost drove me insane aragorn and his accent were to avoid exaggeration pretty annoying thanks to liv tyler for some super uninteresting words whatever they were something about love and forever yada yada yada that being said boromir and a few others had some memorable lines what passes for action is hyperbolic cgi silly costumes i loved seeing goblins prance around like broadway dancers and kung fu blockbuster style action scenes if you have scene any movie with swords and or fighting in it then youve seen this before if you like mtv video games or crack you will like this movie it is a triumph of using good books as an ingredient in the big movie formula you can rent this and spiderman 2 all in the same day then go download some britney spears pictures all entertaining for about 5 minutes if you are over 16 or you are looking for something interesting or new pass this by negative,peter jackson has successfully completed his evisceration of the lord of the rings by removing the heart of tolkiens the return of the king leaving it void of humanity or pathos jackson continues his confusing and odd choices in this film revealing no confidence in the source material relying instead on more comfortable hollywood clich‹©s and tired camera setups which are augemented by the playstation effects that younger audience members have come to expect and which leave others hungry for the versimilitude of tolkiens mamoth and respected at least by some work to paraphrase a touchstone phrase from the 60s `frodos dead and peter jackson killed himnegative,this movie sucks really hard how it beat lost in translation i will never know 11 oscars really even best song huh is that right acting good nah sean austin deserved the best supporting really cant be no oh good people are blinded by its bland cg effect ok gollum looked great but the battle scenes weak take off the blindfold and realize that it is not good i am sad that this movie is second highest grossing of all time yeah i know what your thinking i saw it and i saw the other two the fellowship of the ring was good but the this and the two towers stunk really bad naughty peter jackson naughty go sit in the cornernegative, first and for most the movie was far too long there was no reason for it to be 3 hours and 21 mins much of the film could have been edited and it would have still had the same effectas for all the people who felt the length was good or wish it had been longer buy the dvd and watch the deleted scenses second to much of the film was way to unrealistic even in a place like middle earth im not going to go into any detail on this because some people may not have seen the film but take note also many of the things which could have made this an exciting film were cut short such as the dealings with the witch king besides some great special effects and nice cinematography the film was a huge disappointment in conclusion i am left with a few question how did so many people trick themselves into liking this moive and how did it get to number 3 on the users choice poll negative, one reviewer wrote [my father] spent wwii fighting in the pacific john tolkien had spent wwii warm and cozy in oxford writing drivel um excuse me but you do know that tolkien fought in the first world war indeed it was around that time that he started writing his mythology right i guess not otherwise you wouldnt have written such a silly uninformed comment as for the book being sexist and racist thats purely a matter of interpretation certainly not shared by all the whole complaint about there being no people of color in the lord of the rings is anyway a weak one tolkien created lord of the rings as part of a greater mythology which he intended to be his vision of english myth since nothing substantial was in existence in that regard england is indigenously white as far as i am aware thus all the characters in the silmarillion and lotr are white let me put my point in the form of a question are there white people in african asian or south american myths no there are not thus its unfair to criticize the fact of an all white cast in tolkiens mythology yes i am aware of the easterlings in the book who are described as swarthy and of the fact that they are in league with the dark lord but swarthy does not necessarily mean black and their being both swarthy and bad has more to do with the fact of their geographical occurrence and the fact that they are men it wasnt only the swarthy people who were in cahoots with the dark lord negative,so many high expectations which are all brought plummeting downward in the final episode of the saga first of all orlando bloom is gay he is one of the most pathetic actors i have ever watched secondly this movie is incredibly long and drawn out with nothing any more interesting then what is in the two towers finally it is very disappointing watching the poor acting coming from elijah wood and sean astin they have done better in movie such as north and encino man fortunately for the avid moviegoers there are some quality fantasy scifi movies that you can go see such as manos hands of fate and mortal kombat annihalation the only good thing about this movie iswait there are no good parts about this movie take this review serious because i am serious if you want to call me and talk to me about it call 1 805 423 6182 ask for chris or alexnegative,i feel like im on another planet when i hear people talk about this movie it is probably the worst movie that i have ever seen its only rivals are the two previous lor movies was there some weird subliminal suggestion that im immune to were they serving some drugged cool aid that i missednegative, the lord of the rings the return of the king the review how is it that such worthless eyecandy with one traited characters and a predictable storyline make it into the top 250 has every female under 18 given it a ten its disgusting the dialogue is pure crap much of every question asked in the whole series is usually answered by listen to your heart  is frodo alive  listen to your heart  should i marry aragorn even though hes mortal  listen to your heart the movies special effects are good though the battle scenes leave no suspense and are only fun to watch i truely didnt care for any of the characters aragorn as a brave noble warrior blah gimli as the comic relief wtf legolas as the cute archer yuck gandalf as the wise wizard dear god saramon as the greedy evil wizard pfft frodo as the innocent caring victim originality people etc who cares what bugs me the most is that this overrated garbage is actually in the top ten of the top 250 in front of pulp fiction citizen kane casablanca seven samaraui forgive my spelling 2001 a space oddesseythe list goes on its sickening summary the lotr the return of the king is overrated nothing more then eyecandy overall grade 1 10 40 negative, well the lord of the rings trilogy seems to be a cheap action movie which hasnt much common with the great book from tolkin the return of the king has some nice battle scenes but its just another action movie with mostly good special effects many good parts of the original book where totally twisted mixed or deleted with not much sense and some very stupid parts are just invented from peter jackson to show more of this not so impressive orlando blum its good that tolkin cant see this movie i just hope it makes him not spinning in his grave my hint to peter jackson stay at your roots and make more splatter movies like braindead negative, i cant talk about the thousands or more positive aspects of this film when so many people are so overly optimistic about it and completely blind to its sometimes unacceptable flaws when i saw it i wanted to spit at the moviescreen its a truly great movie but there are so many stupid unnecessary faults and flaws preventing it from being perfect that you just gotta hate it doesnt people see the excessive use of cgi graphics making this film look like final fantasy dont you see that what you just think it looks cool wow look what they can do those special effects guys dont you realize no one will be impressed by the effex of this movie in 20 years those of you who havent read the books how can you like this at all as just a movie cuz it isnt even a movie its a really detailed animated synopsis of the books the three of them that is and not really accurate at that ever wondered where the drama went the depths of any scene or character the direction and exhibition if i can use that word of the parallel story lines or are you just revelling in the roller coaster ride feel to the film the cool effects weaponry and armour digital creatures the battle scenes and the heroic speeches with the typical romantic gaze of the eyes looking out over the horizon i actually usually enjoy the latter things but its just too much here and not good enough this really is true porn for the mid teenage rpg junkie and immature and nerdy men are you really that superficial cant you smell the melted plastic sure this truly is a gourm‹© dish all the more reason not to have any funny odeurs interfering with it this review wont be helpful to most of you of course cuz yall are probably like everybody else i just needed to spread my word get it off my chest peter jackson deserves all the respect he can get and the actors are really great and perfect for their roles but dont over do it this trilogy film is not the best movie ever made not a chance princess mononoke and spirited away each carry more depth than all three parts of lotr together its magnificent and overwhelming but not brilliant a film of this magnitude shoulnt leave anyone unsatisfied but it did at least with me cuz it didnt live up to its potential and it wasnt even better the the prior part so of course i was mad at it how couldnt i be how couldnt you be its like youre fanatical muslims or christians and this is the holy bible or coran you cant even question it or criticize it wake up negative, spoilers this has to be one of the most boring movies in existencewith the exception of superman to me star wars has always been about the action scenes but theres barely any of them going on in this film the sappy romance subplot between han and leia falls flat on its face being too predictable the only good thing was vaders revelation that he was his father to luke and that wasnt even confirmed until the next filmi think i read something about that at one point it originally turned out vader was messing with lukes head all in all a weak film in the middle of the series bottom line the worst star wars movie yes i am including menace negative,this isnt actually a review of this movie but a review of the top 100 movies list here obviously if the majority of users on imdb rate lord of the rings the return of the king as the 4th best movie ever there either arent many users over 14 or the majority of users know very little about good film making im sure i could easily come up with 100 movies that are better than all 3 lord of the rings movies thats really all i wanted to say is that by rating lotr as one of the best movies ever youre proving to the world how useless this site is for knowledgeable critical movie reviews how can one take the ratings on this site seriously after having realized that lotr is the #4 best movie ever according to imdb usersnegative,i love the lord of the rings all 3 included i love the epic extremely long nature 3 hrs+ each that really allows the viewer to become immersed in the world that being said as much as a movie like braveheart is extremely under rated for its amazing acting directing etc lord of the rings is conversely overrated exhibiting in many instances very poor acting gimli anyone a weak translation of the book the books blow the movie away and truly subpar directing regardless of what the academy or any one of you fools may think lotr could have been a truly epic masterpiece if directed and acted accordingly however it still remains a very entertaining movie even with all of its flaws albeit in ten years it may unfortunately only be remembered as the most overrated movie in history 45 all time are you kidding me that is absolutely rediculous which is really a shame for such an ambitious fun to watch movienegative,bad bad bad it is such a shame that this movie is so bad it really has the potential to be great but no no no the first two movies were okay but this last one really sucked and yet everybody are joining this mass hysteria over this really really bad movie i just cant understand why a movie with really bad special effects and really bad acting bad directing but a great story can be the winner of 11 oscars the world has truly gone mad and to add it as the second best movie based on votes from users its sad just sad there are tons of movies that are better and this really is the movie that would never end very long ending 30 minutes of fading and ending only to not really end bearf i think people are mistaking the movie for the book sadnegative, i just got home and i must say that i am not as satisfied as i thought i would be the film is very good but in my opinion is far way to be considered the best of the trilogy both previous movies were more intense than this one the battle scenes are awesome but the rest is very slow and quite difficult to stand for three and a half hour the ending is boring and that scene where legolas beats a mummakill cmon what does an army stands for if a single elf can handle such beast a third part of a trilogy which is in the 3rd place negative, it is a great pity that people cannot distinguish between great works of literature and the failure to exemplify these works in the cinema graphic medium these three films adapted from the great work were shot on low quality film and in a manner to make the greatest profit from as much exploitation of its artisans as possible for example peter jackson knew that he could new zealand citizens to be extras at no costs due to the novelty of under taking such a project of this magnitude and glamor in a parochial isolated hometown new zealand countryside peter jackson fran walsh and philipa boynes bought the film rights of the great literature for a massive cost and then hired scriptwriters to prepare the screenplay adaptation in their names at great cost this was a very poor screenplay if you really loved the books and actually read them which most of the films audience probably never could or did how the motion picture academy members voted it best screenplay adaption and gave the award to these three people is rather suspicious the cinematography was very poor with many shots out of focus and overuse of various camera techniques this has been supported many cinematographers in many blogs the acting performances were very mediocre and the selection of actors was purposefully chosen from australians and new zealanders due to peter jacksons view that they are better actors than americans and the british in fact australians and new zealanders have this strange dislike americans despite consuming their films the animations of various creatures was so similar to the vampires in dusk till dawn it makes you wonder if the cgi people had much imagination the many gratuitously violent scenes not described as such in the books would have been very frightening to children let alone the ridiculous characterization of the golum in fact most of the cgi was carried out by americans hired by peter jacksons multi million dollar cgi suite which at the end of the day makes you wonder where mr peter jackson got the money to not only buy the film rights to the books but to build a multi million dollar film effects studio in new zealand the whole thing was obviously a massive profit making exercise in profit making with peter jackson and his mates securing huge merchandising deals in the planning of the projectit is further proof that the very wealthy and privileged can always demonstrate what their money can achieve not what they themselves can achieve due to any talent or real imagination it was not made for the sake of love of a great work of literature but for profit and self aggrandizement i fully understand that films must make profit but this one really couldnt go wrong with the material and the present day innovations in cgi i am certain that one day someone will remake it and do it properly and maybe some one like john boorman who was originally going to make the film i am so content in thought that there is a great difference between people like myself and the people who glorify this film and peter jackson negative, i really enjoyed this movie well about 45 minutes of it unless you are a die hard fanatic for the lotr books and maybe even then youll want to watch this with one finger on the fast forward button some scenes were excellent but not enough when diluted by so much filler the special effects may have been masterful but they didnt make it a great movie the movie simply takes itself far too seriously how else could the director possibly justify being almost 35 hours long similarly to voters here this is rated as #3 in the top 250 of all time that is so astoundingly overrated that i cannot understand it this with 65000+ votes it probably belongs in the top 1000 perhaps about #800 [how has the studio managed to create 45k+ imdb accounts to skew the voting] the basic flaw of the entire trilogy is that its based on a long winded violently racists set of books starting from that you end up with well you know truthfully this is a 7 10 but it could have been a 75 if theyd actually done some editing down to ~15 hoursnegative,wat the hell is good about this movie its too streched out silly stupid ending every second you think its going to end but noooooooooo one more scene to gotoo long for nothing 3 hours can be smidged into an hour and a halfthe pervious 2 are much betterthat film is sososososos overrated its patheticnegative, actually i was hoping for a grand finale since the first installment was a glorious epic tale and the second was a piece of rubbish i was thinking that this moive would at least save the triologys face all starts good with a nice version of the becoming of gollum but to my dissapointment once again the story is told with the use of too much action scenes and some bland conversations and a gruesome amount of corny one liners the feel of an epic dissappears the moment the first flashback comes and the undeniably bad actress liv taylor makes an appearance yuck adn whats the deal with eowen she was alright in the two towers but now she suddenly becomes this girl power icon im not a man she says and slays a nazgul so what you say well its not the fact that she isnt a man that kills the witchmaster but the fact that its a elven blade that strikes him and if i recall it correctly its merry who deals that strike if the movie only would of stayed true to the book why doesnt it this was a once in an eternity opportunity and that dork peter jackson blew it as a movie fan im appaled and as a tolkien fan im angry rape negative,to say that this movie is overblown pap is an understatement like its predecessors this flick employs just about every movie clich‹© in cinema history like long long death scenes fake death scenes how many times did freddo die only to our surprise hes really not dead at all  a mans gotta do what a mans gotta do scenes in fact what with the clip clop galloping of horses everywhere i thought it had strayed into a western ride like the wind type comments abound the mad bad king who dies a horrible death coz hes so mad and bad the cute little hobbits were all supposed to cheer for and even a darth vader type chief villaincoupled with a script that was so lame the better actors were really pushing themselves to the limit trying to make the lines sound at least half original in fact the only interesting characters in this enermous exercise in money grabbing movie cynicism were the villains the orcs at least had character not surprising then that the movie relies upon the gollum to sell it in years to come this lumbering saga of over hyped over produced trash will be not be regarded in the same way star wars is but in the same way titanic is bit of an embarrassment negative, i had such high hopes when i first heard that a tolkien fan was going to write and direct a live action+cgi version of lord of the rings only to have them cruelly dashed fotr was a bit rough but i said to myself itll only get better boy was i wrong i suppose the main problem is twofold first jackson is way too young inexperienced to have taken on this project he certain has ability but he has a lot to learn about filmmaking before even thinking about tackling such an ambitious project second for alleged lovers of the source material jackson and company took way too many liberties with the story changing them in pointless and even foolish ways perhaps this was inexperience maybe it was just laziness or a lack of understanding of the source material goodness knows that lotr is far from perfect as an example of storytelling but there is a great tale buried in tolkiens massive tome too bad that jackson and his crew were absolutely unable to bring it to the screen by the trotk jacksons exhaustion is practically oozing from the screen and hes lost sight of many key elements of the story negative, the star wars movies were the worst movies of all time science fiction by itself is bad enough let alone being a cult like nerd flick the music was the best thing and even that was melodramatic at times and come on whats the whole long time ago thing if we dont have flying machines now we most certainly didnt have them in the past ok so maybe the star wars movies dont belong on the bottom 100 but in the top ten is ridiculous what a protagonist i say as the great mavoric murdock said only the best will be the worst the irony in this comment is astounding for you see if the public does not recount the degeneracy who will let me explain for every brilliant movie made there are many more hidieous movies so then if there are an abundance of awful movies then mediocre ones will seem fantastic and good ones will seem godly for example the godfather my point is that the praise of star wars is merely a product of being surrounded by worse movies negative,how long was this awful film almost 4 hours the last 30 minutes were really taking the mickey in no uncertain terms the ring gets destroyed thats it movie over we really dont need to see sam & frodo get saved by eagles or them return to hobbiton or see bilbo & frodo leave with the elves does that even happen in the book the end of the film drags on far too long also the build up to the 2 main big battles drags on far too long as well if you are going to adapt a very long novel learn from frank herberts dune which originally was 8 hours long when dino delaurentis shot it dont bothernegative, all of the lord of the rings movie are overrated but thats just my opinion they are not good enough to even be on the top 250 how could this be number 3 or did u just say hmm this movie won an academy award umm it must be good its not all it was was action and boringness now i dont necessarily hate these movies but definantly overrated i mean not even being worthy of an academy award or being on the top 250 i mean come on people ive seen people with good movie taste say these were good in my opinion the 2nd one was the best and the others were hardly okay for me and i did not like the 3rd and was very angry wen i saw it under godfather and the shawshank redemption i mean jeez now this is only my opinion but i know several people who agree with me now this is just my opinion so dont get all offended negative,the third lord of the rings movie was absolutely painful to watch even worse than the second one it had me cringing and groaning all the way through and not because of any empathy for the characters but simply because the acting the scripting and the everything was so so so so stupid and that is quite the word i was looking for beauty and the beast arwen makes me so mad for appearing at all the wrong times and far too frequently its all very well to say directors privilege to change parts of the novel and all right im fine with that privilege but it can be taken too far arwen only appears twice throughout the books and her character is only established in the appendix j r r tolkien is most likely turning in his grave or at least frowning furiously from afar as he watches these mutilations of his wonderful trilogy and when denethor jumped off the pyre i almost died laughing and i dont think that was the reaction peter jackson was aiming for ah well disappointment comes in all shapes and sizes and the biggest disappointment of my life came in the form of a movie called the return of the king negative,as god as my witness as god as my witness theyre not going to lick me im going to live through this and when its all over ill never be hungry again nor any of my folk if i have to lie steal cheat or kill as god as my witness ill never be hungry again this is what i was fully expecting to come pouring from sams mouth as he and frodo were collapsing for what seemed like the 200th time on the way to get rid of the ring or was that the heart of the ocean from some of the music and the similarity in the scenes between throwing the ring into the fire and heart of the ocean into the sea i wasnt sure i didnt know if i was watching gone with the wind titanic or some hobbit movie and if they had cut about an hour of elijah woods pained and soulful looks into the distance and the eyes of his friends they could have made the movie a manageable length just a wee bit too much drama what a disappointmentnegative, peter jackson who is talented at one thing and one thing only spectacle finishes his hugely successful trilogy im so glad this less than mediocre hack was given the job of writing and directing the film adaptations of the some of the best written fantasy literature ever the innacuracy of the story shoddy pacing inconsistent characterization via poorly written dialogue and hugely misunderstood character relationships and statuses are the largest sins committed in this film but the problem goes deeper this is just another in a long line of films quite nicely summed up by the word blockbuster and quite nicely critiqued by the trio may it rip documentary the blockbuster imperative in which the course of popular culture is outlined as a quest for and to quench the thirst for excitement rather than enrichment thank you peter jackson for shitting on the world you are so over rated it hurts me and your movies will never stand the test of time negative,stupid movie already slightly better than the first 2 installations at least we did not sleep for more than an hour during the show and caught the ending whats the fuss about these movies spectacular views well why not take a tour in australia and experience the views first handnegative,rotk is one of the most hyped movies of all time i think that it is also the most personally disappointing movie i have ever watched i was so excited to see this film i was left with a bitter taste in my mouth the first blow came when instead of showing the white wizard sauromans demise we open the film with something from the hobbitgollums backstory this made me mad because i was told that sauroman was cut because they didnt want to dwell on two towers apparently they didnt mind dwelling on the hobbit so what you have in return of the king is a villianous army with no general no main villian save for sauron who is only in the film as a spirit only what you have as the main villian is a bunch of stunt guys in very good costumes the action is fine in the film but aragorn just doesnt sell his part well imho his leaving to find the ghost army is waaaaaaay understated legolas and gimli are made into nothing more than his stooges who look assuringly at him whenever he has doubt frodo sam gollum on the other hand give great performances and are the only bright spot of the film although i think sheloub was a huge disappointment and did not live up to the hype preceding the film the ghost army looks like scooby doo animators drew it and the action scenes involving them are all wide sky shots where you cant see what is going on the multiple endings are also a plod along as the movie stops starts stops starts and finally comes to a end long after i was ready to leave the movie just overall disappointed me greatlynegative,i saw rotk yesterday and its undoubtly the best lotr movie peter jackson is a genius and i really hope he wins an academy award for best director as always some goofs can be found but who cares the patient waiting is over because this great movie has finally been released and now some words about the actors elijah wood frodo played his part tremendously well but one cant really call him the star of this movie even though he carries the ring which he eventually destroys sean astin samwise played a much interesting character and i hope he gets nominated for his role merry and pippin played by dom monaghan and billy boyd are also two very funny characters they have a very strong friendship and dom & billy really show that on screen my guess is that it will be lotr time at the 76th academy awards in march 2004negative,why ill tell you why this is my opinion first of all i cant believe its in top five of all times this is unbelievable and i think even the producer is surprised of the position of his movie im just asking you to think about what major revolutions the movie has brought first of all the story was already used in a previous moviethe lord of the rings 1978 the special effects are great but what about the matrix the music and the costumes are great but this is ordinary for a movie with that budget and the plot is for kidslets face it with no passion or feelings etc just the old war between good and evil witch is present in any jean claude van damme or stallone movie im very sad not because the world is insane about the movie because the movie is in top 5 of all times so they leaving me no chance but to vote the movie with 1negative, i watched the fellowship & could live with the changes the two towers made my heart sink too many alterations & additions yes additions i can understand cutting the story to fit but shovelling lumps of extraneous storyline in that is not in the book why extra elves at helms deep wtf why cut bits that those familiar with the books are expecting to add garbage that no one expects i cant explain the return of the king was for me the last straw the return of jacksons ego more like why they saw fit to change dialogue from the original in some cases only a few words & in others changing the speaker of the words this is peter jacksons lotr not tolkeins i havent checked but the credits should show inspired by jrr tolkein because this is not his work i will stick with the bbc 4 version which while abridged is true to tolkein & the pictures are better on radio negative,i first saw this movie when i rented it out from my local video store i can honestly say it is the worst movie i have ever seen it doesnt even deserve the right to be called a movie i am a big fan of episodes 1 and 2 and i wasnt really disappointed with 3 but empire strikes back is just horrible the acting is dreadful the bad guys arent scary of funny and arent even both guys the kid who plays luke skywalker is dreadful and your left hoping the bad guys actually get him and strangle him the storyline is just stupid and why they decided to keep the same characters as the first two home alones is beyond me overall i have to say this movie is a big disappointment and i only gave it the rating 1 because i had to if i could give it a zero i wouldnegative, this is not a movie deserving of an academy award sweep i remember watching it on opening night and seeing the audience confused about when to leave fanboys with staffs and fake beards got up a good twenty minutes before the final roll and then quickly sat down realizing that hey it aint done well it should have been i think that if you win an award for something it needs to be great at whichever aspect throughout the movie won for editing but it wasnt edited well throughout the direction wasnt anything to hoist high either i didnt find the acting dynamic in any way and if i see one more helicopter sweep of the mountains as our heroes run oh never mind oh and the giant arachnid was nice but some of the other special effects ugh nonetheless the series was impressive because the time it was turned around in but i dont think they needed to sacrifice quality for getting em out three christmas in a row some of the special effects in the final lava sequence looked like land of the lost for chrissakes so for those of you who want to argue that they deserved awards because of the daunting task of turning around such films forget it they could have taken their time like harry potter and done fine i dont even like harry potter but i dont see flaws i dont see repetition the acting is more impressive so why award them when they didnt even live up to their best potential i look forward to the fan boys saying my comments werent helpful thats why i gave it one star if fan boys are going to bully the vote to put these movies in the upper echelon of films which is ridiculous i reserve the right to under them to help future generations know that the fans are delusional and overzealousnegative,spoilers frankly put this movie sucked what could have been spectacular with only a little care was ruined oh dont get me wrong if you are some lazy movie goer who considers yourself an expert because you own the extended editions of the first two movies on dvd you will certainly enjoy this movie if you are like me a hardcore fan who has practically memorized the books i dont see how you can enjoy this film it starts out fairly well and continues like that for most of the film although the changes are not usually welcome at all cite arwens magnified part to make it sappy or gollum and frodo leaving sam altogetheri could have accepted that sure shelobs lair was all wrong well yeah it did annoy me that at some parts aragorn was more important than the whole ring of power which must be destroyed the whole love triangle was blown way out of proportion and by editing out his almost death it might have been possible to film some of the wonderful scenes in the book that the movies carelessly deleted but like i said it was all right until the end the ring was destroyed magnificently i admit the aftermath was done well but there is no excuse for skipping straight to the happy ending lalala sunflowers and daisy chains and frolicking puppies for all what the just happened no scouring of the shire for that saruman just might have been left out altogether no adjustment for frodo i might also add that by having gollum and sam make so much external conflict for him it practically obliterates all the internal conflict the audience is unprepared and confused when he decides to keep the ring however back to the mangled ending put aside the major parts in an effort to appeal to teenage girls i assume the filmmakers decided to give arwen a much larger role and make eowyns affection for aragorn much more serious as well so why do they not bother showing her courtship with faramir a large part of the books is condensed into two camera shots of them standing beside each other at the coronation of glorious king aragorn who seems to have washed his hair for the occasion i know he was on a trek in the wilderness no shampoo but how come he shaved more then but back to eowyn her sudden attachment to faramir makes her seem like she is nothing but a man chaser first she goes after aragorn future king and current war hero when he spurns her love she takes faramir steward and war hero as the next best option ridiculous just ridiculous to sum up do not see this movie do not waste your money this review is long i know but it could be so much longer if i wanted to mention everything wrong with the movies anyone who is a true fan will regard this as nothing but filth a pure waste of timenegative, the director was pretty jealous of the fact that a movie has to end otherwise this movie would never have had an end an interesting start the first movie of the trilogy fellowship of the ring but absolutely boring on the road to the end of it im disappointed with this movie as ive expected more of it the characters seemed wonderful at the beginning but the director made the worst of them shameful more shameful as this is the movie that won the oscar i cannot think of the motives the academy awarded the prize to this movie but the money that went into it its the second time in the history that i know of that the academy appreciates more the cost of a movie than the quality of it and of the actors play its interesting in this approach that no actor in this movie won the oscar why is that negative, this would go down as one of the worst movie of the year an overhyped tale i havent read the book but after seeing the movie i will steer clear of anything to do with the lord of the rings the convinently call able ghost army made it the most anti climatic ending after the 6 8 hrs spent building the tension over the 3 movies it is the same as the anti climatic fight at helms deep when gandalf appears to save the day what was the purpose of the elves there were so many holes in the plot the emphasis that sam wise was not gay was sickening meant wasting 5 mins in the end showing he marries a woman and has 3 kids to make it more suitable to the times frodo and sam wise should have just come out of the closet it is a shame that people have voted it to become in the top 3 movies at imdb negative,its an okay film epic and all of course the fact that its an epic like gladiator or troy doesnt mean its good troy proved that fact and alexander continued to prove it with one star antics to be quite frank peter jackson is an overrated director much like the lord of the rings movies are overrated movies if you notice all three are located in the top fifteen films this one happens to be ranked higher than greatly superiour films such as seven samurai schindlers list and even casablanca this is not the case with camera angles that make you sick utilising the admittedly beautiful landscape of new zealand to help push across into our heads the true epic feeling of middle earth but wait where are the interesting characters every one of them you feel so bored with by the time the first film is up you seem to hope that theyd be dead by the second one but no they come along to the third one to kick some sauron ass heres my view of lord of the rings a whole load of walking lord of the rings fellowship of the ring points there walks lord of the rings the two towers points there walks trips up walks on lord of the rings return of the king points there walks throws ring into mountain walks away take those completely identical scenarios and pile them up with useless plot for three to four hours per movie depending on which one you watch and i myself wouldnt touch the extended versions you really get the idea that the academy awards truly are flawed why look forrest gump won best film of 1994 instead of the shawshank redemption or pulp fiction titanic won best film of 1997 instead of la confidential and why lookey here lotr rotk won best ing film of 2003 instead of mystic river perhaps next year well have the constant gardener as the best film of 2005 that may actually redeem the oscars failing reputation a reputation that had truly fallen when they took this half arsed effort of a movie and worshipped it as best film negative,man fellowship was much better than this piece of junk a lot of the shots were horrible the cgi except for gollum sucked the dialogue was beyond cheesy the battles were anti climatic the way the war ended w the dead people was dumb the ending dragged on and on and on i checked my watch at least 15 times during this movie the battle scenes blah and if the fate of the world is in your hands and your supposedly out numbered why freakin joke while your fighting and putting notches on your belt thats just so freakin lame the attempts at comedy in this movie were laughable if you want to watch a movie w real battle scenes do yourself a favor and go see last samurai ive seen that movie 2 times and im going to have to see it again to get the bad taste out of my mouth that is rotknegative,this movie is overrated and frankly sucks as a film it has very few elements of a good film and was toooooo long anyone can make a good movie in about four hours the trick is to stay under three hours and still have a forceful impact the movie had too many fronts there were frodo sam gollum aragorn dead people mary rohirran and gandalf pippin the movie is good entertainment if youre willing to sit long enough lotr freaks have kept giving this movie a 10 making a mockery of the voting no thought is actually being given during voting and personally i think people should just give it a one just to counteract the false votingnegative,i dont know if you have seen the same movie ive seen but this movie was awful i really really liked the first movie an obvious 10 the second was a little bit worse yet still a 7 but this one was really bad i mean what is the reason for a happy happy happy happy end which is 30 minutes too long the characters are flat and no one cares if anyone of the main characters dies or notlike the king because you cant feel connected to them gollum should be dead two times before he is falling into the fire it is just boring after the second part if hords of orks are fighting against man and the worst thing was legolas after sliding down this elephant like animal and posing so bad animated and so silly unfortunately this movie was so disappointing like matrix 3negative, you people are so comic it makes me batty is it a good movieyes was it a brilliantly imagined and epic series of filmsyes was it one of the best 50 films of all timenot a chance in hell i dont care if you 15 year olds want to live in fantasy land the rest of your lives but spare us from this lotr are the best movies ever crap we dont need to hear it and it makes us laugh it was a great series to watch but when you come on here and disrespect the film greats of all time and have any of these lotr movies in the top 100 it disrespects the entire film industry if you want to play fantasy time then go on a disney board and post away but do us all a favor and leave the imdb for real movies negative,i have now put myself through the sometimes enjoyable but mostly painful experience of watching these three movies i have to say i do think the 3rd one was the best but lets be honest it didnt have much competition one thing is for sure this film and the trilogy as a whole is easily the most overrated event in history many films should be above this effort in the top250 the problems the plot for starters not only did it not make any sense it was basically after 9 hours about destroying a ring and fighting a couple of battles all the meaningless subplots and political gesturing really didnt add to the film the characters werent fleshed out at all even after 9 hours could you really mention much about any of the many characters as a result most of the time i couldnt care less about who was doing what and why for a film to be a classic surely it must have some surprises or must be original in some way and perhaps more importantly stir the juices of our soul all we had were some very good special fx and some nice new zealand scenery the filming was very much join the dots stuff nothing novel or clever it the way it was shown to the viewer do we really need to here the word `precious again and again do we really need to see yet another slow motion close up of frodos face all of this made the film and films over long and lacking in any substancenegative,well this movie is not for people who like subtlety not for people who like good dialogues not for people who like interesting characters it is for people who love action action and nothing much else for people who love pompous battles on big screens hollow words rhetorics of of the kind great dictators are so fond of big words like today mankind will not fail sure i can see why people like this movie they are just easily pleased they see a big battle scene and theyre happy they see orcs orcs and still more orcs and they think wow these orcs must be metaphors for all the bad bad people that are out there on this evil evil planet how deep what geniuses are tolkien and peter jackson they see a helicopter view of a battlefield great graphics of a fictional city a realistic monster spider and theyre happy they see good triumph over evil and they think thats the way it should be because well uhm because its different from real life i guess it gives them uhm hope it must be nice to not see that cheap emotions the flat characters some of the most stereotyped dialogues ever written in the history of film it must be great to be able to love this movienegative, i think that star wars episode v the empire strikes back bis the worst movie i had ever watched although i have only watched it one time i really do not like this movie for several reasons first the movie does not have a proper ending it just stops when all the battles have finished and do not explain any other things after the battle instead it only shows a shot of the characters looking out the window this really disappoints me second about the love between princess leia and han solo i have never thought that leia and han solo are a couple until they suddenly kiss it makes me feel very surprised because the movie does not show any obvious relation between them third the movie does not tell story but showing a battle sequence instead it is very boring for audience to watch finally the battle of luke and darth vader did not bring out a mood of climax but instead it makes me think that it is ridiculous these are the reasons why i dont like this movie negative, holy smokes this has got to be one of the most pointless trilogies ive ever seen i do not even know how it d this high there was nothing that made it stand out at all throughout the 9 excruciating hours of watching frodo turn into a mentally disoriented fool i cannot recount a single moment in time where i said wow thats interesting first off the plot is simply unenjoyable it has no twist no character building and for gods sake its about a possessive ring watching the characters go through pointless trials to burn a single ring is not something i can find appealing in fact i was ready to watch any of these uptight hobbits meet their end that is a huge problem in this series not one character was tragically killed in the midst of any orc battle ok there was that no name in the fellowship of the ring but the audience didnt give a damn as to what was going on with him what made me even more angry was that these fools looked almost invincible when legolas and gimli were slaying orcs left and right as easily as brushing snowflakes away i was ready to step out of the theater i can see why people liked this movie the action was indeed thrilling and had great deal of special effects thrown into it i remember legolas first arrow being launched smoothly into an orc what a marvelous scene then i looked and he was launching another arrow in a similar fashion then another one and another one sure it looked great but it was so repetitive i got bored every battle in this movie is almost exactly the same swords swinging arrows launching and people screaming i just cant see what was so special about it i also could not get through my head the final battle scene honestly an army of the undead destroying the orc forces gee that must have been a difficult victory it was so predictable and unfair i simply hated this movie for all of the action attempts and turning a really old trilogy into a movie i was considering giving this film two stars but then i remembered the conclusion frodo and sam were being saved by a bunch of hawks or something and everything seemed to be at peace not a bad ending then the story stretches into farewells and goodbyes good luck and god bless ok i can tolerate this now bilbo is going into a boat and heading off to god knows where when is this bloody movie going to end by the time i got out of the theater it was nearly half an hour after the part where the movie would have made an effective conclusion my behind sweating like an oxen from boredom i would definitely not recommend this movie to anyone unless you are amazed by a couple of special effects i dont know how this movie did so well i think one critic said it was a good movie and it spread like wildfire or maybe there was simply nothing else to do but worship elves whatever the reason i do not want to see this ever againnegative,i want to be as honest as possible in my review of this film i comment on this movie as i feel outraged that it has been given such a high rating on imdb first my credentials as a fair and impartial reviewer i am a native new zealander my mum new peter jackson well & i quite enjoyed his early films bad tastethe frighteners heavenly creatures & particularly brain dead some of the movie sets were just a few miles from my house and i had the opportunity to work as an extra on the trilogy and all were treated graciously additionally i was a huge fan of tolkiens book and had a sense of excitement and wonder that the lord of the rings was to be made into 3 films in my home country many of the bad reviews posted here compare the book to the movie and the movie will always come off worse and i must admit that when i saw the fellowship i was horrified at how bad and boring it was compared to the book but come two towers i came with an open mind and quite enjoyed the film judging it on its own merits and i had the same plan going into the return of the king additionally i must admit there were a few parts of the return of the king that i thoroughly enjoyed the lighting of the torches the juxtaposition of the brave warrior riding of to almost certain death to please and prove himself to his father while dad casually feasts on grapes supported by a beautiful song the scene where the kingdom bow down to salute the brave hobbits also the brothers acting was fine aannndd thats about it this movie was awful for me first and foremost because it did not draw me in to the story for only seconds at a time did i care for or could i make sense of the story and the acting i was simply bored and restless some of the reasons for this follow the length 3 hours + + peter have you heard about the innovations in film editing and what is with the multiple endings it was like one of those nightmares where you wake up but you are really still in the dream and cant seem to get out i believe a natural ending would have been with the salute to the hobbits frodo oh nodo frodo wore only one expression on his face for the entirety of two towers and the majority of fellowship and return you know that look of pained resignation of sore weariness all those head shots kind of got boring also i just did not buy him turning on his loyal companion sam taking the rascally creatures word over his additionally having struggled so long and hard being so pure of heart for the whole journey you just suddenly decide you want to keep the ring at the last moment cmon sam smithersthe part where frodo sends you away and you start to cry i wish i could erase the pained forced feeling of that scene from my memory warrior woman i cant remember whether it was in the book or not but the ease with which you dispatched an enemy far more powerful than you or just about anyone for that matter seemed a little unlikely it bet daniel sons victory over a vastly superior opponent in kk3 hands down hordes of the undead those ghostly figures aragon summoned um it wasnt too suspenseful for me seeing them do battle since they were invincible and could not be attacked back legolas a shame to see the kick arse archer from fellowship & towers reduced to a one very fake looking scene taking down the baddies on the elephant dwarf i like a dwarf to be ascetic and noble not comic relief aragon why did you change your voice tone and go all james l brooks on us when giving your coronation speech my friend suppressed a laugh karl urban there was an excellent scene in the trailer where you screamed and wailed at the sky below your father the kings body lying dead on the earth that scene really got my heart racing i cant believe it was absent in the movie the battles who was fighting who the editing was such that i couldnt see which characters to root for as the action flied by too quickly and clumsily golem we get that the ring has corrupted your soul and turned you into something horrible over the years we get that you will make a play for the ring before the film is out was the opening scene biography really necessary finally and by far most disgracefully please keep in mind that all three films were filmed at the same time using the same actors production crew and locations the first two movies got just a few oscar nods in minor categories such as sound effects editing how can return of the king be that much better than the other two that it sweeps up 13 or so oscars everything for which it was nominated shame on you academy my guess is that the money from new line cinema was not all spent on making and advertising the film itself bouycott the oscarsnegative, this flick was about 15 hours too long there was more wasted time and film in this installment and none of it added anything to the production this film certainly did not deserve any of the awards that it received thankfully elijah wood only has about 25 minutes of screen time total for the entire film im so glad this trilogy is over i am also glad that i didnt go see this flick at the theater i would have felt even worse had i spent 9 bucks on a ticket for this extended play boredom fest even at 299 the dvd rental was too much at least i was able to make my own intermissions no film should be this long i cant recommend this flick for anything but an aid for when you cant get to sleep this was a three and a half hour passing of a gall stone shame on the academy for showering this tragic effort with so much gold negative,bad bad bad it is such a shame that this movie is so bad it really has the potential to be great but no no no the first two movies were okay but this last one really sucked and yet everybody are joining this mass hysteria over this really really bad movie i just cant understand why a movie with really bad special effects and really bad acting bad directing but a great story can be the winner of 11 oscars the world has truly gone mad and to add it as the second best movie based on votes from users its sad just sad there are tons of movies that are better and this really is the movie that would never end very long ending 30 minutes of fading and ending only to not really end bearf i think people are mistaking the movie for the book sadnegative,this movie is so damn boring one of if not the worst film ever made give me a real movie with real actors with a producer with real talent these movies made me want to throw up they were so horrible dont waste your 3 hours watching this movie its not worth it theres better ways to spend your time did anyone really believe that green thing that cant even talk it was like that stupid jar jar character they put on star wars now if you want to see a movie with action and adventure with better writing then go watch face off dont waste a minute of your time on this movie please who ever voted and made this movie #3 where it doesnt belong it should be along the lines of worst movie ever i rather watch from justin to kelly a billion times then waste my time watching a movie like thisnegative,okay this is a pretty good movie but i just find it hard to see it in the top five thus the low  although it certainly has a lot of great things about it there is a great deal wrong with it as well which i suppose must be expected from a film that is trying to condense 500 pages of literature into over three hours it must first be said that this clearly too long or at least there are points in the film were it does seem to lumber along it also seems that jacksons choice in which parts of the film were to remain in the final cut left out a great deal of interesting stories from the books and the ending is completely different to that of the book and unnecessary that said it is still an incredible achievement overall with excellent battle scenes and amazing effects surrounding an already lovable story but i still wish jackson had made more use of the characters its a great film to watch for sure much better then a lot of the stuff were seeing now but it still could have been a great deal betternegative,well as all of the tolkiens books are nothing more than some dumb fairy tales any movie based on tolkiens book is gonnawell jay and silent bob fans you know the quotei dont like but i tolerate fanatsy in gerenal but this is by far anyone who likes sitting and watching orcs and goblins speaking single minded lines about some trashcan worth ring for 2 hours are welcome any sane person keep out 0 10negative, perhaps i cant lay all the blame on peter jackson the story was dumb to begin with for those that dont know the idea of the ring originates from platos the republic the ring of gyges basically this ring gives gyges the power of invisibility which he exploits to take over some kingdom and yada yada not a very interesting story on its own but good within the context of the republic glaucon and plato were arguing over the tendency of man to do good over evil and vice versa lotr does not intertwine philosophical explorations with a clever plot instead it merely takes this stupid ring story out of its origin and assumes that is insightful blah this is why i rarely akin to fantasy its authors are prone to employing cheap fiction thanks for making america even dumber peter jackson never make another movie please negative,i can not believe that this movie received all the awards that it did it was long slow moving predictable and the acting was terrible i cant believe that they cut out over an hours worth of video to get it down to this length i wish that gandalf would have just given frodo a giant eagle in the first movie so that he could just fly in and drop the ring in the volcano and save us the pain of watching this series i was also worried that there was going to be a love fest between frodo sam and the other hobbits also with all of the computer generated scenes why go all the way to new zealand to film it at least it is all over with nownegative, the expectations that were built up by the first film and the second allthough slowed down really plunged down into the lava of mnt doom with this one it really makes you nauseous thinking about everything that is wrong in this film im not talking about the extended version that one is a lot better but still far from perfect and how everything could have been where should i start its overly sentimental i mean really and i like that s usually im a sentimental guy but here its really out of proportion and out of timing oh its really sad when faramir rides to meet the orcs when he has no chance of winning while pippin is singing som silly song like hes castrated and then breaks out and cries just like that bu hu this is a mythological style heroic fantasy tale not titanic everybody are so overly emotional and i dont even wanna talk about sam and his constant speeches about bravery and not giving in with the hand on the chest looking out over the horizon with the orchestra at full volume the only thing missing is the american flag bellowing in slowmotion behind him and frodo and his constant twisting your head like a puppy and looking with big eyes and a oh i love you so much smile at sam every time he saves him or helps him to keep going ok im getting carried away i liked braveheart for example even though it has some major flaws and people think that one is overly sentimental but that one is at least down to earth sentimental rotk is up in the sky almost gone out to space like i thought id never say this but it seems they producers crew and actors really take the film too serious really its a saga not true its a 20th century made up mythology history about an imaginary land its not a record of the holocaust for christs sake i understand how they needed to cut some scenes to save up time but well first of all they didnt succeed enough with that the films are 2 3h long and still it feels youre rushing from one place to the next like youre on a middleearth 8hour safari or cinematic tourbus maybe they shouldve cut it even more so we could at least get the feel of being someplace and not just passing by but whats really unacceptable is when he wastes all that preciously gathered time on exploring uninteresting or unimportant scenes and scenes that dont even belong in the story completely made up scenes for no logical reason the ugly made up bull rhinoceros beasts pulling orc wagons whatta f is up with that i dont even know if george lucas would accept such a badly designed creature in the star wars universe the really awful orc liutenant chief guy whos by the way made up out of thin air who doesnt even look like an orc but more like the aliens from peter jacksons early lowbudget cult films mr jackson this is not the time and place to have cameos or draw funny parallells to your bad taste films thats really bad taste disrespectful to the tolkien fans the m‹Èmaks are really cool but really too big i mean theyre not dinosaurs beasts heyre just big elephants all the small details costumes and armour etc are really beautiful really more than you could ever ask for but the white dwarf miniature esthetics of minas tirith is really bad cause it gives a whole synthetic comic book computer game look to middleearth where are the beautiful classical and authentic designs of edoras and rivendell and no catapult can throw rocks as big as whole houses that too is just corny and childish like in computergames all this and the excessive use and naive belief in cgi technology turns the battle of pelenoor fields which should be the total culmination and action peak of the film into a foney uninteresting starwars warhammer40000 mess its nothing compared to the battle of helms deep and thats not right and this cgi trend seems to be a virus infecting everybody in the film business its really sad these films will be outdated in 10 years but maybe thats a good thing rotk isnt the worst of the three technically but with the expectations you have from the first two the books if you know whats gonna happen the demands should be pretty high and in my opinion too especially after the hint in 2towers that the trilogy was going downhill just like the matrix this is the film that disappoints the most rotk is the greatest and heaviest of the films the first two would completely crumble under its weight if it didnt hold but they could also rise with it if it really grew as strong as it couldve and that is what it should have anything else is unacceptable to me and this is also why i hate it cause it really doesnt live up to its potential it doesnt even outdo the 2towers and it doesnt live up to the old exited expectations you had from the first film i cant understand how a new zeelander who used to make underground films could turn this old british tale into shimmering hollywood cheese its too pretty too pompous and sentimental and all the computer graphics gives it lika a fake sugarcoated shine or crust its like food add too many ingredients and spices and theyll take out each other and the dishll just taste bland its just too much of everything and the whole film falls flat its still stunning but rather tasteless and the only profound experience you might get from it comes soely from the overwhelming magnitude of the whole thing i still wanna congratulate pjackson on successfully bringing this gigantic project home thank him even if hes made me more irritated than delighted cuz im still glad that im able to watch these films he didnt deserve all those oscars but he definitely deserved a few maybe not for directing but for best film for the production but this film should not be ranked as the best fantasy film of all time sebastiannegative,i decided to watch this trilogy with a completely open mind to see what the fuss was all about i was rather embarrassed by the fact that i had never seen any of these movies which were heralded as great cinematic classics instead of the masterpiece i was promised however i was left with a great mediocrity the characters were barely 2 dimensional the plot was riddled with holes and horribly rushed and the dialogue was cheesy episode v was perhaps the least painful to watch but still isnt close to being good i dont know if its a case of a movie aging very badly but i cant for the life of me understand the allure of it to each their own i guessnegative,however the real acting triumph of the film is elijah wood as frodo baggins he continues his descent into corruption with an incredible talent that many could not pull off woods performance is so critical to the film because it determines the rings power to corrupt which needless to say is absolute the first two films established jackson as an incredible visionary shooting vast landscapes from his native new zealand with return of the king jackson really gets a chance to show off with hands down the most beautiful visuals of the trilogy jackson makes return of the king a gorgeous feast for the eyes while never resorting to mcg level over the topless jackson stays very grounded in his characters not letting the effects tell the story but only assist the wonderful dialog and characters think of return as a mix of fellowship and two towers with enough action and character development worthy of ending a film event of this magnitude the bottom line fans of the films will not be disappointed hardcore tolkien lovers might be upset by plot changes and interpretations made by jackson and the other writers however it is unrealistic to expect a completely true adaptation of the novels being that film is an entirely different medium despite the alterations jackson consistently stays true to the major themes and ideas from the original text while adding some of the finest film making ever put to screen the lord of the rings the return of the king is one of the most finely tuned and cinematically perfect films ever made not only the best of the trilogy but a crowning achievement in epic film makingnegative, moves even further from the source material more so than the two towers by peter jackson and fran walsh too many elements are changed from the heart of tolkiens work sam would never have been turned away and by the way just how did he find that sword and the light of elendil in shelobs lair with no light source also shelob is spider like but not a spider there were no webs in her lair even worse is the acting of john noble as denethor yes denethor has despaired but int he movie his madness is related to his use of a palantir and competing against sauron saurons will was stronger and he bent denethor left him bereft of hope this movie he is a caricature a cheap poorly rendered badly overacted caricature faramirs character was assassinated in the second movie but it is his father who is torn asunder even worse in this one aragorn had the sword anduril after he left elrond and rivendell and says so in the the two towers before entering the hall to meet with wormtongue and theodenbook here it is given to him by elrond who never came to visit aragorn it was elronds sons and the remaining rangerswho allude to no longer protecting the borders of the shire foreshadowing the scouring and they brought the banner of the king not the sword aragorn acts like a haughty king in the paths of the dead where in the book the scenario is much more dramatic and better also the dead were released before the battle at pellenor fields after helping them capture the ships with black sails that scene looked like the frighteners part 2 absolutely ridiculous it is a pretty to look at movie with no substance when compared to the source material tolkien loved the scouring of the shire and felt it was the true climax of the entire work yet peter jackson called it a simple denouement and said he hated it the better story isnt in these movies and i hope that people can read with a finer eye than they watch these movies with they arent that good and each slips further down the first adaptation was the best of the three and this was the worst hands down negative,yesthis movie has great production valuesbut it is artificialfalsewithout a single remarkable performancei adore ian mckellen and cheese lines from the most commercial and stupid hollywoodthe humor between gimli and legolas is so simple and stupid that i had to laugh and the hobbits jumping in frodos bed at the end is one of the most ridiculous moments of my spectators life the battles are a poor imitation of lawrence of arabiapeteri prefer you in heavenly creaturesyour great masterpiecethis movie is only for fansnot for mei will say this movie is the worst of the five nominees to oscarsmystic river and lost in translation are great movies much much better than this piece of crap for male teenagersnegative,the difference between art that comes out of the studio system and art that comes out of a lifetime if only we could develop a moving image pillar that was not driven by base profit we might see an expression of tolkien on film that was decent the fall this is the beginning of the end for our civilization when art is so corrupted that people can no longer even tell the difference our way of life is over anthropologist alien or otherwise will mark the success of these films and of george bush and of television as the harried and quickened end of the west not unlike the fall of numenornot that you would know anything about that from these adaptations what a disgrace how dare jackson call this tolkien negative, ok so i saw this movie on dvd last weekend and after those long 200 minutes i still cant understand all the hype and hoopla associated with it and being called the greatest trilogy of films of all time ill be the first guy to agree that the visual effects are amazing and they blew me away and directing a fantasy tale like this is a colossal task but i cant comprehend this movie getting 11 oscars probably because there werent too many strong candidates this year it deserved every award in the visual effects category but best editing cmon now im sure they could have done a lot better than 200 minutes after watching it for awhile the plots if i may call them seem to repeat themselves its just another new breed of evil guys creatures with new out of this world names and our heroes get past them imho mystic river was a better movie and deserved the best motion picture for the year i dont think the academy should give best picture award to a movie just for its visual effects dont get me wrong im really not trying to bash this movie but i really cant see why this is rated the #3 movie of all time on imdb with the other two parts in the top 10 the only reason i can think why this movie is rated so high and other exceptional movies are falling in the ratings is due to more people voting especially for the latest movies nowadays besides every other person has a computer these days and i wouldnt be too surprised if the younger audience preferred this visual grandeur to an intellectual movie which may be harder to grasp i personally like movies which make me use my brain for thinking and not just for watching like matrix mulholland drive sixth sense memento etc at the end of the day this is nothing but a huge fantasy tale movie which has a few human characters in the midst of grand visual effects i havent read the book but im sure the whole trilogy could have been concised to 4 5 hours instead of 9 10 hours i kinda feel that the film trilogy is over rated but thats just me ive noticed some people cant seem to accept that others dont like a particular film but after all likes and dislikes are just a matter of opinion watch the movie if you have a lot of time in hand and dont want to think too hard negative,its an okay film epic and all of course the fact that its an epic like gladiator or troy doesnt mean its good troy proved that fact and alexander continued to prove it with one star antics to be quite frank peter jackson is an overrated director much like the lord of the rings movies are overrated movies if you notice all three are located in the top fifteen films this one happens to be ranked higher than greatly superiour films such as seven samurai schindlers list and even casablanca this is not the case with camera angles that make you sick utilising the admittedly beautiful landscape of new zealand to help push across into our heads the true epic feeling of middle earth but wait where are the interesting characters every one of them you feel so bored with by the time the first film is up you seem to hope that theyd be dead by the second one but no they come along to the third one to kick some sauron ass heres my view of lord of the rings a whole load of walking lord of the rings fellowship of the ring points there walks lord of the rings the two towers points there walks trips up walks on lord of the rings return of the king points there walks throws ring into mountain walks away take those completely identical scenarios and pile them up with useless plot for three to four hours per movie depending on which one you watch and i myself wouldnt touch the extended versions you really get the idea that the academy awards truly are flawed why look forrest gump won best film of 1994 instead of the shawshank redemption or pulp fiction titanic won best film of 1997 instead of la confidential and why lookey here lotr rotk won best ing film of 2003 instead of mystic river perhaps next year well have the constant gardener as the best film of 2005 that may actually redeem the oscars failing reputation a reputation that had truly fallen when they took this half arsed effort of a movie and worshipped it as best film negative,i have seen many movies in my time a lot of bad movies and a lot of good movies i like movies from all genres this is easily one of the worst movies i have ever seen i cannot comprehend why this movie is considered good an overacted badly directed self important repetitive uninspired shallow video game of a movie not a single character of depth ok smigle slighty what was the point no imagination in the directing acting set and art design slow motion oy am i sick of slow motion now that was creative editing whats with the ending that was a 30 minute goodbye get on the boat already die already die die die die die how long does it take to die gandalf all powerful wizard nine hours of movie and all he can do is shine a light in the dragons eyes ooooh scary light not recommended for anyone and those who liked it are wrongwrongnegative,more attention should have been paid to the eyes in the blue screen sequences in the film it is all too easy to see three distinct light bulbs reflected in the eyes if we are to believe the actors are on the mountain then they should not be lit as if they are in a studio at times i felt like i was watching a weather broadcast you know the ones where it is so blatantly obvious that that what is going on behind them is only a projection im sad to say that there is still a long way for cgi to go in terms of becoming believablenegative,this movie is a painsimply horrible boring too long bad acting bad writingpratically i don t save nothing of this pile of garbagethe fake looking special effects are some of the worst i have ever seenthe sad thing is that this overrated turkey won so many oscar quite a testament of the low level of the academy awardsterriblethe editing is a complete mess the only saving grace are the wonderful new zealnd landscapeshow many ending it had 10 20 come on its simply laughablein conclusion a very bad and overrated movieanother thing this movie is number 3 of all the time imdb webmaster its time to change the imdb vote modalitiesnegative, if this movie did not have based on book by jrr tolkien it would have canned like waterworld and other big budget disasters having based on book by jrr tolkien does not guarantee success even if the scriptwriters followed the book word for word and yet peter jackson and fran walsh et al took it upon themselves to re write the lotr book and change the characters almost diametrically opposite to what they were written and it didnt work at all a director producer is entitled to modify the book to make it accessible on screen hardly one change from the script team worked at all in this case gandalf took the brunt of the bastardisation in rotk after aragorn got butchered in the ttt if not in fotr in fotr peter jackson was lucky in making a clone of the bakshi cartoon and it turned out fine with the new additions on the dvd once the cartoon ended in ttt however jackson just ran out of ideas and inspiration rotk is brash and loud and big and comedic production but the substance isnt there despite drawing from the book of the century some dialogue were puzzling go home sam was there a taxi available nearby others were just bad a diversion thanks legolas there was a lack of suspense and a total lack of sacrifice both sides seemed evenly matched camaraderie nobility the forced emotions and acting and soft lighting only go to reveal how clich‹©d this anti hollywood movie really is is it then any wonder that christopher lee wanted off this badly conceived and edited project enjoy it as a fantasy film and an inside joke from the scripting team that no one really gets and nothing more despite 11 oscars thanks for the effort peter but please have the self respect to refuse sympathy oscars or if you really want to kill 3 hours with the kids people just want to believe so desperately that the tolkien movies are as good as the books when the hype will have died down the merits of these films will be judged accordingly the fact that chris tolkien son of the author remains silent on the trilogy speaks volumes on the quality of the trilogy as an extension of his fathers writingnegative,first i am a huge fan of the lotr series by tolkien it is one of the most richly detailed and wonderfully written stories of all time and it pains me to see the dreck that peter jackson has produced i didnt mind the fellowship of the ring i thought it was definitely the most concise and well directed of the three films also the visual aesthetics of the films are excellent the set design and choice of locale is impeccable and i applaud the people involved for their dedication to recreating the surreal wonderful world of tolkien on screen however it is the technical aspect of the project what should be the real beef of the film that puts the knife in the two towers marked the real beginning of jacksons self righteous altering of tolkiens noble story and left many fans and serious film goers wondering what went wrong but return of the king takes the cake for what could very possibly be the worst adaptation of a novel in film history jackson changes large portions of the plot of the novel for no apparent purpose even friends of mine who had not read the book asked me why certain scenes resolved the way they did the character development is excruciating as some of the major character based events from the book seem rushed and inconsequential in the context of the film jackson has done a great job at remembering the characters names and their titles but has drawn a blank on their behavior values emotions and relationships with other characters the script is pathetic tolkiens majestic storytelling and tasteful use of pathos and emotional turmoil is replaced by long winded sappy clich‹© monologues complete with the exact same musical  used for the previous two films entire scenes are based around petty arguments and melodramatic emotional breakdowns and filler dialog is rampant it seems that jackson did this simply to keep the 3 hour running time the action sequences are grandiose and somewhat true in objective form to tolkiens telling of them but jackson employs cinematography that is on par with a nickelodeon miniseries using cheap close ups and nauseatingly swirling camera angles that leave the viewer feeling more confused than involved in the action jackson throws in some cheap action film comic relief during the battles giving the viewer the impression that the characters are not fighting for their lives but rather swashbuckling for swashbucklings sake very simply this is not the lord of the rings that i grew to love years ago when i read tolkiens masterpiece i am a supporter of artistic freedom in the adaptation process ie kubrick coppola but not when the adapter simply has no artistic ability in his craft jackson genius behind such film classics as the frighteners and dead alive this film does not belong in the top 250 nor do the other lotr films knowing that this film is above seven samurai and casablanca and that the first two lotr films are the reason citizen kane sits at #11 sickens menegative,this two hour version is a terrible war movie very violent and i wouldnt want my kids to go through what we went through watching these six piles of garbage the empire strikes back 30 minute version that garry hixon put in his files after innerspace is really really a masterpiece unfortun ately disney would not allow it to actually be released i only get about 30 hits a day on my 4 videos and im sorry to say dont have the money to release too many more but theres always hope i really enjoyed the exp erience in 1980 but i was a dumb kid stoned on marijuana and acid the computer graphics were very avante garde at the time its definitely a love story compared to my version but is is very long and very boring there version of the force is levitation which is not the force the force is feeling it feeling it and not using the ability too often then levitation is possible thank you disney love cinderellanegative,i dont get the point with all that 11 oscars 9 10 on imdb but what this is sensed to be something artistic some postal card landscapes and ridiculous one liners damn try to be intelligent scenes about loyalty and all there is nothing in this movie nor in the two others that can let me say it is a good movie no plot no acting no directing there is nothing in this movie and i dont post that to provoke reactions i truly think it and i dont understand to be so isolated with this point of view there are well done heroic fantasy movies like conan the barbarian that are seen like average movies and this is put on a podium i hope im not the only one it makes wanna pukenegative,if the first film bored you to tears and the second one bored you to death the third film will not affect you because you are now numb and totally disinterested we have even more of those pointless scenes with sam and frodo more battles and more cgi and how many endings can a film have theres a huge battle and then they tell you there is another one and its still not over because there are a million loose ends and then they go back home and then bilbo leaves home and then sam has children is that the end or is there more i cant even remember i fell asleep during one of the particularly tedious scenes with sam and frodo this is not a film its a pointless sequence of scenes and an exercise in cgi that resembles a video game one you can only watch but not play and i still dont care about a single bloody character in this filmnegative, if you are a tolkien fan i guess this is as good as it gets for the rest of us its just another movie and a fairly peculiar one imagine star wars return of the jedi without an appearance by darth vader or the evil emperor thats what you get here a struggle between good and evil with the leaders of the evil hordes conspicuously absent its quite strange then theres the consistent theme that the better looking you are the better your character is dr king convinced me that it was the content of my character that counted not my appearance but in all three movies of this trilogy the two go together quite closely its an old hollywood theme but not particularly to be admired as for aragorn preferring arwen to eowen i suppose there is just no accounting for taste and im sure it is faithful to the author and what can one say about the seemingly endless multiple endings not very dramatic but perhaps more interesting than the usual single climactic ending so on the whole i find the return of the king a watchable film but hardly one of the greatest of all time eleven oscars i guess it must have been a bad year for movies now that you mention it theres been a lot of those in recent years negative,this was a bad bad movie at one point i was going to ask for my money back because i thought that the reels were put in the projector in the wrong order save you money save you time the best thing that you can do is to do anything except watch this movie if i could rate lower that a 1 i wouldnegative,lord of the rings is an overlong piece of crap from one of the biggest hacks in hollywood peter jackson used to make low budget horror films that were amazing now he makes big hollywood movies with big hollywood stars his aim now isnt to make good movies his aim is now to make as much money as he can why cant hollywood start making films that are actually good instead of films that they make to reel in cash who needs so much money why does peter jackson need more money seriously peter jackson needs to stop making movies he ruined king kong recently and he made three films that are entirely too long based on a crappy overlong series get this film off the top 250 of all time it sucksnegative,and poor characterization as a technical achievement its a masterpiece as a work of drama its mediocre to lame the dialogue scenes were overwrought with drama much like a soap opera although instead of sappy hammond organ music we had the sappy orchestral  rising and falling on practically every syllable jackson deserves a lot of points for his technical skills but none for his artistrynegative,the godfather was a sickening experience the first time i saw it in its initial release and it hasnt changed i thoroughly disliked the films spirit finding it very ugly at its heart i saw little justification for its existence was sorry i saw it and have tried to forget itnegative,one thing i will say about people one generation older then me you dont like violent movies if they are about zombies or guys in mask with knifes or chainsaws but when it is about guys with greasy hair with guns you cant get enough of it the men from my generation come by it honest about enjoying violent movie there is not one likeable crictor in this crap this is one of worst gangster movies ever the only gangster movies that are worst are sequels this movie is a pile of pooh it is not the best movie ever it is pooh pooh never never never see this movies it is pooh pooh pooh pooh pooh dont wast your time dont wast your money pooh they all bad guys kill each other boring i want good guys in crime drama poohnegative,i personally find this film to be a milepost on the decline of american society this is a film in which paid murderers are our heros who endear themselves to us with witty banter between their bloody exploits it features such entrancing scenes as countless murders s&m rape drug overdose and other fun things to watch its a wonder six flags hasnt opened a thrill ride to capture the whole experience it features all manner of completely unredemptive characters doing cruel inhuman or brutal things to each other is this entertainment the last straw for me was when a young man was accidentally shot dead by our irascible heroes the big problem posed by this is how will we clean out the car what can you say about someone who views human life so cheaply hit men or no what can you say about someone who finds such spectacle to be entertainment the characters here are completely dehumanized uncaring about the horrors they inflict on one another and ironically much of the audience must be equally dehumanized to accept these characters as the good guys if tarantino is the genius this film led people to believe that would have to be his point wouldnt it that to enjoy this movie you would have to be in some way sicknegative, theres nothing deep or important going on here so a critique of this film is almost unnecessary what passes for quality film making is nothing more than an overproduced loud stunning imax experiment in eye candy that masks once again a slowly moving thin story line obviously the members of sag have dispensed with background checks on film editors theres enough slow motion footage here to circumnavigate the globe twice many people will be amazed by the neverending in your face action sequences but for those who still pine to see the actors perform also youd better search elsewhere its like trying to read the latin version of war and peace while simultaneously being pulverized inside a blender and if having way too many computerized fight scenes forced down your throat wasnt enough just wait the full ninety hours for the saccharine glazed overlit endings and there are at least 5 of them for a while i was expectin obi wan kenobis ghost to show up and smile goodbye and cate blanchett never looked so vapid its brass tacky loud long obvious schlock and thus hugely popular beautiful looking rarely translates to quality in content and this is a prime example giving so many awards to this fillibuster is just a waste of gold plating negative,i just managed to stay awake through this load of crappy excuse for a motion picture it only contains a enormous amount of words that don‰«t say anything the two main characters are so stupid that they should never have been created and when bruce willis disappears from the movie it is so totally dead this is a total waste of time and so is commenting on this junk so i will stop nownegative,long and boring and not worth writing two sentences but since i have to long and boring and not worth writing two sentences long and boring and not worth writing two sentences long and boring and not worth writing two sentences i think you get my pointnegative, wow a lot of people have been fooled into believing that this was a great film ive never seen anything like it and i hope i never will again this is one slop of a film and im disgusted to know that it has so many high reviews it was a confusing ball of goo that amounted to nothing i didnt care for the characters and never will what a hopeless bunch of freaks i dont jump on the freak bandwagon unless theyre natural ones not arrogant embodiments of deranged entertainment the glorification of smut is worse than the smut and that is exactly what this movie is the sad thing is i dont believe that some of these actors were acting at all they were just being themselves travolta and jackson in wigs that was scary the only interesting thing about the movie was the sequence of events i like the way that it started at one point and ended in the same but dislike everything in between the problem with this film is that it tricks the audience into giving it great reviews it uses the peer pressure method you know this movie is for intelligent and cool people crap well ill gladly stand among those who know that this was nothing more than a shock flick it was produced to see if the letter could be pushed a little further unfortunately it drags what little respect that hollywood has with it im afraid that this is one of the major stepping stones to a pathetic industry that only produces films for vulgar lust theres my two pennies dont spend them all in one place negative,man fellowship was much better than this piece of junk a lot of the shots were horrible the cgi except for gollum sucked the dialogue was beyond cheesy the battles were anti climatic the way the war ended w the dead people was dumb the ending dragged on and on and on i checked my watch at least 15 times during this movie the battle scenes blah and if the fate of the world is in your hands and your supposedly out numbered why freakin joke while your fighting and putting notches on your belt thats just so freakin lame the attempts at comedy in this movie were laughable if you want to watch a movie w real battle scenes do yourself a favor and go see last samurai ive seen that movie 2 times and im going to have to see it again to get the bad taste out of my mouth that is rotknegative,i dont like this movie because it is boring and stupidnot entertaining and nothing interestingi dont know why it is even in top 250peopleplease vote 1 for thislook at movie to see how bad it isand you will vote 1because you will see how stupidboring and not interesting this film ispleasevote 1 and save film artdont let this garbage rule wonderful art of movieshow many film there arethat are truly art made of geniuses are under this garbage of filmyou cannot put this garbage on first placefirst place of all movies is holly place for filmsit should be

number 1i feel sorry for epiclegendary masterpieces that are underthisi hate this film with all my hart and soul 1 out of 10 cheersnegative, the 90s sucked it was one of the major eras of entitlement and dagnummit quentin tarantino was entitled to the stylistic gimmicks he absorbed from french new wave 70s exploitation and martial arts films he was entitled to use every character as a mouthpiece for his preciously quirky offbeat voice he was entitled to that word that makes spike lee mad when white people use it he was entitled to co opt obnoxious heroin chic hip retro fauxhemian fashion trends tarantinos movies echo the problem with modernism okay you think the status quo is bad but if what you do is just a kneejerk reaction to that status quo with no values ethos or any sort of moral core how can you be sure the result wont also be bad in fact chances are it will probably be worse right nonsense the emperor doesnt appear to have clothes but thats just because only the most profound virtuous people can see them you want to be part of that group right negative, next to burt lancasters the swimmer this is the worst movie ive ever seen if you like two hours of non stop profanity senseless violence and a story that has no beginning no middle and certainly no conclusion and if you like an underlying theme of inhumanity and perversion then i recommend it it you want a story that is well acted and well thought out dont waste your time this is a movie geared for an audience that is very young if only in mentality and very unexperienced in lifenegative,this film stands out like no other as an utter piece of shte when i see all the accolades and devotion that film receives it makes me want to vomit not only all the bile in my body but the blood that is contained in it as well pulp fiction is a testament to our downward spiraling american society it is a monument to the shallowness the arrogance and vapidness of our self obsessed culture that dwells in the american consumer mind only in america a talentless director whose only ability is to plagiarize greater works can become the most celebrated creator to ever enter film making but you cant say a word because his following is ravenously sycophant they know ever word every phrase every bit of dialogue but they certainly dont know the difference between the real deal and a cheap imposter sam pekinpah never sat down watched a slew of movies and said im gonna steal this scene or that dialogue from this movie and directly put it in my movie nope he created his own stuff he may have sat down and wanted the same feelings to be interpreted in his films but never exactly the same way neither did sergio leone john carpenter george romero ringo lam bo arne vibenius simon nuchtern the shaw brothers joseph sargent akira kurosawa fran‹¤ois truffaut or even robert aldrich even george lucas after the atrocities that he has committed to his own films in later years has done this most of the names that mentioned are probably unmemorable or unrecognizable to most people but they are in fact only a few in a very long list of directors whose have been stolen by tarantino except of course george lucas so far anyway anyways that does not mean his movies do not have merit the earlier ones like pulp fiction are laded with quirky and funny dialogue but thats all they have because plot characterization and substance have gone out the door tarantino cant even tell you a linear story he uses a disjointed structure to hide the weak plot he uses clever dialog to take place of decent characterization in fact the funniest thing to me is that his seem to have a non stop spouting of words they never seem to stop talking but in the end they never really have anything to saynegative,the movie starts off with some interesting dialog but it quickly falls apart and becomes unwatchable some people apparently found it clever to tell the movies stories out of chronological order in fact it undercut any feelings one could have for the characters and made the movie far more tedious then it had to be the first half is merely dull and boringthen it becomes ugly gross vicious and disgusting it ends up being forgettable and sickening out of the 50000 movies and 50000 television episodes i have seen in my life this would rank about #8 in the 10 worst needless to say i have never bothered to see a tarentino movie after this onenegative,i have seen a lot of movies made from computer programs lara croft etc however this computer generated cartoon beats them all no nobody really gave a great performance individually or they would have got a nomination and won it no doubt but the graphics oh man they almost looked like a real movie being shot moreover the special effects were incredible i can see why this movie won seven oscars for special effects alone i mean you have to give it to this movie it had some great special effects oh sure the acting was overdone and a bit sappy but man get a look at the special effects here i mean it won 11 oscars so i guess it must be the best film ever even though nobody from the film was acknowledged for their performance because nobody was really great in it but man the special effects here outstanding hey a billion geeks cant be wrongnegative,i will never ever understand the love affiar people have with this movie it is completely and utterly over rated marlon brando is not the god of an actor he and people make him out to be neither is al pachino for that matter the acting is pretty stiff and unbelieveable it was so freaking long ugh i hate this movienegative,the godfather all in all is a great movie and the best in the organised crime genre but putting it as the number one movie in the top 250 films of all time and the top of countless lists is too much the roles of marlon brando and al pacino are excllent but the film on a whole is very over rated the direction is good not excellent the script is by no means ground breaking but many people still refer to it as the best film ever made next time you watch this movie compare the script to something with more life and witeg fight club and more lavish directingnegative,without the use of computer graphics this film would not be worth the price of a cheap bargain day 3 for 1 special rental at the local video store true the locations and cinematography add to the film however heaven forbid that the cast should either have to act or in the case of the veteran actors overact cg removed and this thespian in name only grouping are woefully short of the depth and quality characterization brought forth in the classic book the direction is sporadic and the pace is inconsistent leaving little to the imagination why so much of the budget was spent on computer technicians instead of acting lessons sorry for all those who jumped on the lemming band wagon for this one but lift your heads above middle earth and return to the land of the livingnegative, i think the hype around this movie makes people completely overrate it ok heath does a great job at the joker but the movie itself has many flaws 1 the balance between good and badguy is all out of sync batman fades into the background he also has way less dialog than the joker this makes the movie unbalanced i think they re cut the movie after heaths death to put him in the foreground 2 the movie is tooooo long this story can be shorter with less redundant scenes its like they couldnt choose what to put in so they just put all of it in this gave me and some of my friends several yawn moments near the end 3 gotham city looks like a normal city in batman begins it had a real comic feel but in this movie it doesnt which is a shame really 4 the point of the movie i wont tell u what it is but yes this action movie tries to make a philosophical point of course this can be great but in this movie it gets chewed over and over and over and then it gets forced down your throat 5 lack of humor an occasional sharp or funny dialog would have been great however the dialogs arnt very good and theyre never funny 6 the plot devices are really quite lame i wont go into details but most of the plot devices are silly and inspirationless even the comic manages to feel more realistic than that somehow the movie doesnt manage to convince the audience of its own logic probably cause there is none all in all its a fun movie with great performance by heath as the joker however it is not the masterpiece people try to turn it into it doesnt deserve a place in the top 250 and it is not the best movie of 2008 of course if you settle for mediocrity this is the movie for you negative, i think its adorable that certain members of an unspecified generation find the dark knight aka batman 2 to be a masterpiece of contemporary cinema is adorable the right word christian bale reprises his role as the humorless comic book hero and heath ledger joins the cast as the humorless comic book villain ironically named joker ledgers joker is about as much fun as an emergency spleenectomy which means to say he never laughs never makes anyone laugh and never jokes are we having fun yet the film takes place in the same gotham city from the previous film flat bleak black dark foreboding menacing pessimistic intense sinister colorless numb petrified is this the fun part bale an otherwise fascinating actor manages to create a black hole as both bruce wayne and batman leaving the audience without any protagonist for whom to cheer christopher nolans solemn direction is the same as in the first hes working so hard to convince us that all of this is absolutely real that there is no chance for any fun fun in a superhero movie i must be out of my mind whats sad is that poor heath ledger took the role of actual psychotic so seriously that it contributed to the mans death no film role is worth your life and if playing the villain in a comic book movie messes with your mind youre doing it wrong no offense to the late actor whose performance here would have been great in a dramatic or psychological film but jack nicholson nailed the joker in 89 it was nice of the academy to give ledger the posthumous oscar but i think we all would have preferred he not die before his time this is not to say the movie is terrible its still an above average action flick with some nice moments the sunset prison transfer is beautifully done and the scenes at waynes cocktail party border on subversive but the generally dour approach to the popcorn flick leaves me depressed and i cant help returning to the thought that a man gave his life for this maybe thats what certain members of an unspecified generation want maybe the imagination is so damaged they dont believe a movie character is killed unless an actor really dies i find the death of creative thought rather frightening and i keep coming back to an old horror catchphrase its only a movie its only a movie grade c negative, really a great film but does it really deserve 6th place in the top 250 an perfect action packed film with the emotional charge of a mosquito imdb publishes weighted vote averages rather than raw data averages various filters are applied to the raw data in order to eliminate and reduce attempts at vote stuffing by individuals more interested in changing the current rating of a movie than giving their true opinion of it my vote 1 10 just because the rating is flawed try thinking that mostly internet users are aged ~ 20 or less and ratings based on mere numbers do poor justice to films the masses never saw negative,i just dont get it its not that i think this is an awful movie or anything but no2 look at the rest of the movies in the top 10 does it really stand comparison with the godfather or seven samurai i think not its a manipulative sentimental sunday afternoon movie raised above b standard by some quality turns by talented actors nothing more and who cares whether andy could put the poster back in place or not its a patently ridiculous escape to begin with i understand that most of the people on this site will have a pop at me for being a snob but the fact is i love star wars and lord of the rings and other blockbuster movies but if youre looking for a genuinely affecting drama this doesnt cut the mustard sorry guys but youre all wrongnegative, its not a bad film its just derivative and melodramatic it borrows from cool hand luke a superior film it relishes its significance too much its a bit smug morgan freemans voiceover is a clumsy narrative device i dont know i just know for sure its not one of the best films of all time not even close negative, its an emotional manipulation for dummies type of film with boring direction and cardboard characters nice performances by the actors though some great moments but nothing outside the hallmark meets stephen king meets prison feel of the entire movie i saw it one and a half times and would see it again only if i got paid for the trouble similarly i hated the green mile only later did i find out its the work of darabont my recommendation skip this and go see oz again negative,i dont understand why this movie is so popular yes it was an interesting movie and it was a good movie but it was not spectacular enough to receive all the praise which it has the acting was good and the plot original but it was still a rather ordinary movie apparently im the only one with this opinionnegative, i may run out of words to end with less mindless witless a view of the world thats hopeless horrible acting writing editing lighting and music ive seen it all before only done better nicholsons turn at joker was far far superior ledger mirthless just a distracting concoction of tics bale who knows his augmented voice and masked face made his 2 dimensional performance meaningless dent what a horrible performance something youd see on knots landing where have we come as a society kubrick made a clockwork orange in 71 a devilishly clever mean and stylish film that pushed the limits when it came to on screen violence his young monster alex played by the brilliant malcolm macdowell was a thing to behold now we have families taking their kids to the 08 version of ultraviolence and yukking it up the dark night of america film making is more like it are we really this numb are we really this nihilistic negative, i wasnt so much excited about batman begins simply pseudo intellectual philosophy of fear was rather painful than interesting to me techno futuristic batman surrounded by oh my god cinema stars that have nothing to do with traditional batman characters was nothing special to me but this time i got excited 3rd trailer was absolutely great interesting interpretation of joker though vocally not so good as mark hamill but very original a little bit of darkness the dark knight reminding me of the dark knight returns that then i found out has absolutely nothing to do with the movie it was great but then then come the movie movie that is absolutely boring artistic like weird and is so full of light that calling it dark is an abomination if you want to hear the voice of batman who apparently sings in a death metal band go for this movie if you want to see gotham probably built and designed by ikea especially interiors go if you want to see bat cave so full of light that i had to dive under my chair to bring my eyes some darkness its the movie for you but if you want to see anything really dark atmospheric gothic simply batman like better remind yourself of things like batman the animated series 1992 or burtons movies 1989 & 1992 as you will find a lot of what batman really is there the real dark knight where word dark means something and knight is not meaningless as well the dark knight is absolutely soulless like ikea furniture and even heath ledger do not save the movie as his joker is enjoyable for first 40 minutes then becomes simply boring and all the same whats funny myself and audience around laughed much more when batman spoke with his dark voice death metal band vocalist herewego than joker laughed through the whole movie it doesnt surprise me much as ledger had the biggest problem with learning the mad laughter and although he did pretty well lack of it during the movie lack of single smile on jokers face made it all look very pathetic and then herewego with the plot batman decided to give up twice in the movie of course because he was afraid of what people think and self critique he apparently forgot that he started his obsession thanks to his parents death oh well alfred is dull and absolutely boring i start to believe that its just good to have michael caine name on movie posters lucius fox is ohmygod another star to have bigger commercial impact gordon was and remains not even close to what gordon suppose to be in my opinion etc etc finishing this counting out rhyme with the batman himself personally i love the way chbale acts i admire his role in prestige very much but here i dont see batman all i see is christian bale pretending he is batman sad my conclusion is simple nolans vision is far from what i consider as the dark knight and lack of darkness lack of dark gotham not to mention that gotham lacking of criminals who are too afraid to do their job instead of overwhelming batman with number of crimes is simply a blasphemy lack of darkness in batmans soul and then lack of taste and common sense in the movie are something that made me yawn and look on my watch for nearly whole movie apparently audience thought the same as nearly every batmans line produced fine amounts of laughter and maybe 10 people stayed to see first lines of credits just like they would hear herewego and decided to evacuate as fast as possible literally i know that the future will be completely different but i have high hope that nolan will never ever do another batman again please for the dark knights sake negative,the story was ruined the ending was drawn out the whole movie was shot in this ridiculous this story is so epic i will pan around and everything will seem really dramatic even when there is no real action way it was like a parody of itself i can hardly believe people could find any of the worth of the novels in this self aggrandizing trilogy i only paid $3 to see this film and was wishing for my money back after what shouldve been the final scene of the movie there was this fake 10 minute ending where thousands of people simply cheered on screen it was such a blatant way of telling people the fabulous movie the tremendous trilogy is over lets all celebrate it was terriblenegative, i never write reviews for movies good or bad but seeing this movie in the top 250 list makes me mad its just a movie for teenagers who dont question why things happen when they just dont make sense i went to see this movie with great expectations because my brother told me it was great but after the first five minutes i knew what kind of movie i as was about to suffer one clich‹© after the other with no characters development nothing gothic anywhere and nothing dark or mysterious about this talking batman either also i dont see anything great about the joker interpretation for me leger was just ok no need to glorify an actor because of his death the other actors were just as terrible as the script allowed them to be i really dont remember one minute of believable conversation between any of the characters for a movie to be great it needs at least to make sense its not that you cannot have explosions or great action but this film reminds me more of a bugs bunny cartoon where bugs can be anywhere when he wants to and pull anything out his sleeve i dont want to mention anything specific to avoid spoilers but just expect a ton of non sense action from a bunch of bugs bunny characters its sad how 100000 people cannot see beyond the special effects and tell themselves that doesnt make sense he was in that other ten places 5 minutes ago negative, dont believe the hype not good at all focuses too much on the jokerbatman is supposed to be a hero the old batman movie with nicholson is a much more satisfying movie watch this only if you are 12 15 years old and what is with the darkness batman isnt supposed to be like this it is like they took the worst of the 90s comics and made this movie out of it and i bet that there are a lot of you saying but it made all that money so what that doesnt mean it is a great movie wait a few years the micheal keaton batman will still be around this movie wont the acting is mediocre the action is ok but it focuses too much on the evil side watch iron man or something if you want a super hero movie from this year i give it a 1 10 negative, its interesting to read statistics such as the word f_ was used 463729 times in this film apparently quentin tarantino needs to know how many quarters to put in his cuss jar movies are made to take the place of storytellers and when we sit adoringly at hollywoods knee we expect something fabulous not everyone can spin a good yarn and now we know that even our most promising film makers regardless of their inauspicious beginnings cannot hold our attention without resorting to gore and gimmickry films like pulp fiction 1994 written and directed by quentin tarantino starring john travolta samuel l jackson bruce willis ving rhames uma thurman and many other big names leave me wondering if prominent producers have just flat lost touch with their audiences parents and grandparents must also consider the larger view if a little pitcher accidentally stumbles into the wrong warren at the neighborhood multiplex his big ears will hear fascinating new words that might cause him to stay for a second listen but by the end of this loud red film hell be ready for the booby hatch i worry when hollywood dumps buckets of blood like this on to the silver screen im always afraid youngsters might see it heck im not sure anyone should see it i am disappointed in myself for falling for the fast talk and slickness ignored the wee small voice again i watched the whole thing and now my only hope for personal redemption is to try to prevent people with taste from having anything to do with this self indulgent free for all if i were catholic id probably have to go to confession just for having sat through this mayhem public forums are an excellent way for us film fans to inform these talented and powerful people that we crave clever stories told in creative ways and that profanity and blood are best served sparingly it is possible that quentin tarantino is a genius my hope is that his future work will be full and inspired and that he will begin to move toward the light pulp fiction is a dazzling display of drugs death and depravity and i advise you to see it at your own risk maureen adele compton post script i cant be the only person who thinks its getting worse theyre using curse words now that even people who do swear wouldnt have dreamed of using in public i will admit saying aitch eeee double toothpicks is cumbersome and probably wouldnt read well having said all that i could probably stand it if they would just stop using one phrase in particular you know the one i mean say it now pay for it later amen negative,zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz oh man i will never understand the appeal of this pointing a gun at somebody cussing for 5 minutes pulling the trigger walking up to somebody else and doing it again for an aeon like 2 hours is not very entertaining to me there was not one stunt in this movie and the camera angle never changed and just when you think its about to end nope it has to keep dragging onand onand on i feel like a noose was removed from around my neck when the credits finally rolled why everybody has the poster the soundtrack and the bumper sticker on their car is beyond me then again thank the maker it didnt win best picture rating a much deserved exhaustive negative 1 out of 10negative,if you make your way through the thousands of teens lord of the rings junkies and all the others who voted this movie a 10 for reasons other than a pure movie rating youll find that this is easily the weakest of the three films unfortunately pro it was a good movie and for the most part entertaining the characters are well cast the cgi is good in most places the actors are good enough to save questionable editing and the scenery is still breathtaking great effects in battle youll see worth the $10 to see but not really one you want to see again without having the ability to skip portions cons 1 way way too long and poor editing choices spoiler the multiple endings was totally preposterous and belongs in the extended dvd version for fanzies remember this is a movie not the book that time would have been much better spent on main characters that never surfaced eg saruman whom you never saw again and sauron who was reduced to nothing more than a lighthouse oh yeah i felt how dangerous he was you will get restless at the end of the movie and will laugh your head off as to how awfully campy and forced it feels especially when frodo wakes up and the silly canned laughter begins 2 too much time wasted at the beginning of the film as well mr jackson pick your choices of what to develop the love story and relationship between get any concern for the relationship too bad too much crap with merry and pippin please enough of the hobbit details crap and focus on the main characters honestly i didnt feel like i really cared so much about many of the characters because there was so much cutting between scenes and an incredible amount of time spent on faramir and his going mad father an odd area to place so much time 3 gimli and legolas again reduced to nothing more than comic relief and incredibly cool and unrealistic cgi hero there was practically no dialogue with legolas at all the reduction of these characters made me care less about legolas and made the girl i went with happy the one or two time she saw him but wondered why he was nothing but occasional screen candy 4 the movie felt very tired gollum again steals the show 5 some of the battle scenes were tired a lot of quick cutaways and not as much feel of the one on one combat like you had in the first films also very very poor display assistance of the dead it was as though they used up the budget for cgi and had this wave of green just end the huge number of saurons army in 10 seconds while the other characters hung out to chat it was like a comic strip video game honestly i didnt feel like i really cared so much about the characters at the end and felt like the ring was reduced to nothing more than an overblown reason to have a quest i truly think this movie suffers from wasted time at the beginning and end too many battle scenes and too little time to continue to develop the great dialogue and character development of earlier movies my rating would place this film a very good 75 but that is as high as id go definitely bring some nourishment wear comfy clothes and a watchnegative, im not a fan of this type of movies but since i like al pacino and ive heard so much about this so called legendary godfather i decided to give it a try i must say this is the most inexplicably overrated piece of trash ive ever seen the characters are all ridiculous unsympathetic and under developed the story drags and lacks any real conflict and dynamics‰Û_ but the most disgusting aspect is the movies intent to glorify a bunch of low life criminals and turn them into larger than life figures into some kind of royalty this whole family tradition is just ludicrous were supposed to care about these characters to think that they are cool the major problem here is that theres no real conflict theres no redeeming value whatsoever theyre all despicable and one dimensional so why the hell would i care the violence which is particularly sickening is another issue but i guess audiences have come to appreciate it and its now a hallmark of the genre imagine the godfathers pregnant daughter gets beaten with a belt but guess what shes not likable either shes hysterical obnoxious and even worse she keeps defending her abusive husband in another scene james caan beats the hell out of someone in front of children marvelous thats just great not to mention cool and culturally relevant marlon brando speaking with a husky voice and cotton in his mouth is incredibly ridiculous al pacino as michael corleone suddenly turns from a principled man who doesnt want to have anything to do with murder into a ruthless criminal what this character has no depth no consistency whatsoever his relationships with women are so poorly portrayed they add nothing to his development its pacinos worst i cant imagine why anyone would think this is a great performance if you want to see a good gangster movie go watch donnie brasco instead negative,after 4 years i still consider this the worst movie i have ever seen i have yet to watch any thing else with qts name attached to it everything about this film is annoying the presence of the ubiquitous sam jackson and steve buscemi the weak attempts at shock value the cameo by the director but the one element that makes this number one on my all time worst list is the obnoxious dialogue that tries to be hip and funny threes company reruns have better dialogue and i hate that show its such a shame though because qt and i do have a lot of the same obscure tastes in movies my advice is to try a project that tries not to be shocking funny or hip because pulp fiction fails in all three departments miserablynegative,ok first of all i happen to be a real superhero fan hell you should see the space used here to store all my comics so i usually dont have high demands for a superhero movie i like em all at least until i went to see dark knight that is i went expecting a superhero movie instead i got violence violence some more violence and to top it off some violence at some point i actually started to check watch hoping it would be over soon this movie didnt need a batman the way it played it reminded me off those old b movies you know the good guy gets ticked off and goes after the bad guys bad guys are usually crazy pure violent guys and you end up with 90 minutes of killing shooting and so on this is basically how the movie went first you have the joker who wants chaos and destruction thats is the entire story about the joker no debt in the entire character that is his only motivation and you never get to know why so the movie starts with the joker fighting everyone batman the mafia you name it this goes on and on and on when you finally think the movie is over and batman won it starts all over again then they add two face the only believable char in the entire movie but he plays like 5 minutes overall i went in with high hopes after 30 minutes i hoped the story would get started after 90 minutes i was checking watch hoping it would be over soon i think movies like that should have an lbo warning leave brain outside when i noticed the  this movie got i felt actually depressed and i really hope someone boosted this  by cheating the alternative is so horrible i cant even describe it so i keep on trying to convince myself the world is not as bad as that  tells me it isnegative,i was very disappointed in this film as so many people recommended this film as the greatest one ever created it was no1 in the imdb chart so i rushed out and bought it only to find out that i have wasted ‰£12 on this very below average gangster film which went on for a full 3 hours if you want a decent gangster flick i would recommend either goodfellas or casino as the best in the genre negative,what a load of hogwashabsolute tripe typical american rubbishoverratedbad acting you name it was theregive me will hay any daywhy people watch this trash i dont knowmarlon brandowhats he talking abouthe justs mumblesgive me a british actor anydaylet me sum up and say this is the worst filmi have ever seeni hope to god i never see it againi have been watching movies for thirty years and this is just the worst movie i have seenit typifies what is wrong with the movie industrywhen they can waste money on overblown claptrap such as thisif this is the best hollywood can offergod help uslets just hope it was just a blipand hollywood can again start making decent moviesnegative,okay so ive seen this now and i began asking myself how could this movie possibly end up on 1st place at imdb and how come everyone loves this movie ive seen this and its horrible i fell asleep after watching two hours of this this and pirates of the caribbean is the only movies ive fallen asleep to seriously and yet its so unrealistic like when don corleone is out buying fruits he gets shot like eleven times and still survives you would die after two shots from those types of guns also go see donnie brasco if you like gangster movies this is bad really badnegative, wellwhere do i begin i have no idea heath ledger given an award after he died the man was a drug addict and simply went too far not such a great performance in the film actually mediocre but because he went tits up his role was portrayed as one of the greatest ever nonsense like i said mediocre as far as batman is concerned he definitely needs some throat lozenges what a crock with that voice they had him use it was less than halfway through when i lost all interest and forgot what the plot was if there was one the only reason i saw the ending credits was simply because of the fact that i needed some background noise for the evening you want some real batman watch the 60s tv show campyyes phonyyes utterly ridiculousyes but it was batman and enjoyable in one sentence the worst ever negative,this movie wasnt a disappointment because i didnt expect anything better this pointless piece of shortened my life about 25 hours total waste of time and money cesar romero was much better joker than that untalented schoolboy if i could go back in time i would warn myself about this movie considering how this movie has been rated internet movies and television should be prohibited for anyone under 30 make the right decision dont spend your money minimum length for comments is 10 lines of text so i have to write some random gibberishnegative,ok first i am a big fan of batman and especially batman villains to me joker is even bigger than the good guy and i have 5 elements that are the key to a great movie direction story music acting and atmosphere in the movie and the batman saga is all about atmosphere i watch all 6 batman movies tim burton was good joel schumacher had some good moments in the 3 but blow up at 4 batman christopher nolan is bad his batman begins was bad the dark knight isnt badits dead this movie is dead shore its a expensive project but do something with the moneyi dont wanna pay a ticket to see a trailer lasts 25 hoursthe story is the center not the stupid special effectsi love batman and i still believe in hollywoodbut he is bringing me down and down darkvery darknegative,the dark knight is all hype and no substance ive seen it 3 times and it is just plain awful basically it is too long and convoluted as all get out it felt 4 hours long to me the first time i saw itno kidding i guess the confusing part is worse than the long part if a film flows smoothly for its run length ought not be an issue but tdk is utterly messy and confusing for its running time so nolan wants a realistic version of batman then explain some things to us the big one is how does joker set all this stuff up at least batman begins was grounded in realism explained motivations techniques and plans and had a aura of realism after bb was over i remember thinking i liked this movie although im a burton batman fan i admit that nolan did a very good job with bb it feasibly defined a realistic batman world while still embodying a sense of fun and had a lot of entertainment value and the plot made sense but after tdk was over my impression was what the heck was that some points about why tdk is a weak film to me harvey dent swallows all that gasoline and isnt even sick enough to hurl he is badly burned but his rage and need for vengeance dulls his pain and he easily walks around and does not scare the bejesus out of anyone no one is shocked by the way he looks seriously nolan gordon and batman decide that dent twoface will be a hero and no one will know that he killed 5 people except for them gordons family and that bad cop ramirez im sure they will all keep it a secretplothole maggie gyllenhall as rachel dawes not attractive katie holmes from bb wasnt jaw droppingly gorgeous but she was fairly easy on the eyes and holmes worked much better in this role in bb had a lot more chemistry with bale and had an important function to the story when joker says that she gyllenhalls rachel is a beautiful woman i was like no shes not gyllenhaal is perhaps a better actress than holmes but holmes was actually much more right for the role of rachel dawes gyllenhaal literally has nothing to do and just doesnt cut it in tdk lucius fox played by morgan freeman who just exists in this film nothing else has the ability to do anything technological this includes constructing a sonar device that can scan all 30 million cell phones in gotham city simultaneously or did bruce wayne in his very limited technological training and experience do it either wayok yeah right whatever in bb the stuff fox was selling wayne at least seemed plausible in tdk it comes off as just plain absurd technobabble batman and joker get the crap beat out of them repeatedly chewed up by dogs fall from multiple story buildings and dont even get hurt when batman saved rachel they fell from the penthouse of a chicago high rise for cripes sake that must have been 100 stories easy no bones broken no trauma just ho hum back to business that climactic ferry boat scene is pure de hollywood manipulation it is there solely to reel the viewer in to make it seem like tdk is some kind of original provocative piece instead it comes across as sappy maudlin and empty the ending to that scene is soooooo predictable in general though tdk is choppily edited is populated with one dimensional lifeless characters is humorless convoluted as heck has dull dialogue and is very clich‹© i mean its barely even a decent movie christian bale was great in bb but in tdk nolans hack direction and the script really let him down making him look like a laughingstock as a hero he was barely even in tdk and when he was in it you didnt get any feel for the character so well established in bb what makes bruce wayne batman tick what does he really want just based on one dinner where dent spouts about being a crusader wayne thinks that hes the one the savior of gotham city not very deep character development in addition to freeman you have michael caine as waynes butler accomplice alfred gary oldman as lt gordon and aaron eckhart as harvey dent all giving rather lifeless performances ironically i think eckhart has the biggest male role in the film but unfortunately dent is not very accessible and rather empty to the viewer really bale shares lead honors with oldman eckhart and ledger actually oldman and eckhart may have bigger roles in this than bale and ledger who wants a batman flick where neither batman the main hero nor the joker the main villain have the biggest role these skilled actors are unfortunately operating from a vapid script and extremely short sighted character development tim burtons surrealistic neo noir skewed artsy comic book batman flicks batman and batman returns are truly the best batman movies we accept at face value those films because burtons unique vision not only strived for something different for a superhero movie but also succeeded in a way that nolans films just cannot batman the bad guy who is hated by the entire city of gotham no way not in superhero world not acceptable and i dont care what these nouveau moviegoers so enthralled with this film thinknegative, ok now i was a big fan of batman begins i really liked it but it wasnt really my favourite movie ever and the same can be said for the dark knight first of all whilst the joker was an interesting character and very well written to be honest i dont see what everyone is raving about yes heath was amazing but it gets me thinking was this due to the script or heaths ability to understand and become a phycopath if it really is the second should we applaud it did it live up too all the hype is heath the only reason people went to see it is it the best film of the year the answer to all these is of courseno and i dont understand why everyone is treating it like a god omg it was so amazing best movie of the year you see people this type of person is called a hype hound by the way thats copy written =] a person who bases there sole judgement on the hype surrounding a film and the first few reviews thats not to say there arent some true fans who really did love the movie but im sick of the pretenders giving it tens when they didnt even like it conformity is for those who cant think of there own free will free will is for those who break through conformity anyways guys my final words is a great movie but not the greatest will heath win an oscar yes will it win best picture well lets just see negative,shooting killing shooting more killing some effect by batman doing his stuff the characters in the movie does not grow like at batman begin which was awesome every thing looks the same boring junk movie no surprises i really dont understand how this movie got this high review  nothing exceptional nothing interesting nothing funny nothing spacial just a really boring movie hafte 15 hours we decided to leave the theater which actually happened to me only once before this movie sucks big time do not waste your money and your time if you are a movie maker and you dont have new ideas for sequels please do not waste money and our time on stupid movies i rarely go out of movies in the middle this really really dont happen to me and i did saw all the fantasy batmanspiderman action heroes movies negative, disclaimer may contain spoilers sorry people despite all the unbelievable hoopla this movie is terrible the acting is wooden the story line is moronic the endless one dimensional tirades about heroes and anti heroes are totally childish and idiotic the much praised ledger in the role of joker is laughable there is nothing in his act that is worth mentioning as a matter of fact he was overacting big time and it made it painful to watch his presence on the screen the hand to hand fighting scenes were retarded slow as molasses compare the martial art in this movie to the martial art in the bourne trilogy night and day even batman and robin is more enjoyable to watch than this sorry excuse for an action film two thumbs down way way down negative,humm i saw this film before batman begins and possibly it has better special effects i have only seen the first one it bits but and its a big but this film is very much a perfect example of what is wrong with contemporary cinema its garbage truly appreciate the quality of tim burtons batman by first watching this cart of steaming plops you might be the kind of person that doesnt give a fig about what you watch or you just want to see pure spectacle this film has spectacle and then more spectacle and then just as you are trying to follow what happened and possibly work out that the film is not that great something else will happen end result is a kind of mood average at that rather than any cohesive enjoyment in fact it is probably a bit worse than that even tawdrynegative, its not often i find a movie plain unwatchable but that was the case with the dark knight the reason is plain and simple almost every dialog feels fake as only 1 person speaks per camera point like with cheap soaps where they can only take care of the sound of one person or where the stars dont physically meet that much the lack of chemistry and realness resulting from monologues shot in series an then cut to dialogs is bewildering staggering low quality i honestly found it unwatchable because of that and whats even more bewildering is that this seemingly cheap or ill produced production is considered a master piece by so many i feel like the little child in the emperors new clothes whats going on here has everyone turned blind shockingly bad negative,this is easily the worst superhero movie i have ever seen christian bale with his lisping american accent is the worst batman to have ever worn the costume and the digitizing of his voice only serves to make him appear more ridiculous this movie will bludgeon your senses in its desperation to entertain it is very very loud and there is enough broken metal and glass to start a recycling plant the plot is so fast and frenetic that it rarely makes any sense and just when it begins to it is immediately off in another direction plot threads start and stop every three minutes it seems aaron eckhart is a fine actor but whose idea was it that he should walk around in the last thirty minutes with half of his face burned off perhaps somebody should explain to the writers that burn patients who walk around exposed like that are highly prone to infection and dont live long yet this guy parades around like its just another day in the park with half his face missing and no bandages it was as grotesque and gratuitous as it was silly i guess its what you do when your movie doesnt have much to say the movie has an impressive lineup of movie stars standouts are eckhart oldman caine and roberts they are all very good but none is good enough to save this misfire and then theres morgan freeman is there any movie made these days that doesnt have morgan freeman in it he is so overexposed that he has become a bit of a joke he is also in one of the most ridiculous scenes in the film where he stands befuddled in front of a bunch of tv monitors this is another one of many scenes filmed with high energy and no sense at all as if all of this wasnt bad enough this thing lumbers on for two and a half very long hours arent we all a little tired of the superhero who is conflicted when i hear people talking about academy awards for this film it is a reminder to me of how the industry equates bigger with better if you want bigger this might be your film if you want better look elsewherenegative,i was expecting much more from this film with a imdb rating of 91 silly me and i was disappointed it left me untouched and uninspired 99 % of the time i found the dialogues and the script most of the time boring there is a psychopathic hyper criminal with mass destruction capabilities btw he would have to hire a whole army of commandos just to place and wire all that tnt gasoline barrels etc without anyone notice and the police and the batman are trying to arrest him or save his victims while we the viewers are watching their efforts for 2 and a half hours now what is the point to have fun sorry it wasnt much fun some sfx was good and thats all some other wasnt convincing at all there wasnt anything special to remember about this film nothing special in script in acting in action in sfx and most of all nothing inspiring and diachronic we should demand more quality from the movies not just explosions and killings with impossible enemies the money we spend and especially the time we spend to watch it should worth it we should exit the theaters with a feeling that we have gained something special not the opposite edit on a second thought 3 stars which i gave it initially might give the wrong impression so there you are 1 star for your lousy film try harder next timenegative,cmon folks if heath ledger wins an oscar for his performance then the academy has lost all sense of judgment what film full of that kind of horror gets a pg 13 rating i have read most of the comments on this side of the balance and must concur with all that i have read i just saw the movie just to see it for myself and i wish that i had my money and time back too longtoo gorytoo much of everything negative did dc comics intend for batman to be portrayed in such a manner i think not i really think something in wrong here in americawhen films like this get 9 10 starsnegative, ill have to admit i was not keen on seeing this movie just because i didnt really enjoy batman begins but i had some hope this movie would be an improvement and it was slightly i did like heath ledgers performance as the joker besides having no back story or anything like that does it deserve an oscar nod not really i think thats mainly out of the fact that he bit the big one earlier this year that and he was supposedly going insane whileor because he was taking on the role so i guess the acting wasnt much of stretch then was it i have to admit the direction wasnt very original or spectacular but besides that the movie was chalked full of big bang boom action scenes the scenes that dealt with dialogue seemed to be trying to make up for the lack of action with cheap humor that wasnt all that funny rachael dawes the most pointless character in the new series what can i say about her other than no one really seemed to care about her or her death the only reason i feel like she returned for this film was to give harvey dent a reason to go nuts and start whacking people which brings me to two face was it necessary to shove that villain into the last part of the movie like a bad subplot i think it wouldve been more appropriate for him to have his own sequel but i guess the writers really didnt think he deserved that i also feel like everything in the movie was so forced together i mean 3 villains in one movie and none of them hardly interact i mean you got scarecrow briefly cameo ing his way into the first little bit of the movie i dont mean to compare the movie to burtons works because thats biasedand screw you because i am but batman returns had all 3 of its bad guys smoothly fit together in the film was it really that hard the last thing i really did not like in the movie was christian bales i must sound like im an 80 year old woman who has cancer and still smokes after 60 something years voice other than those things the movie was okay does it deserve a 97 to be above the likes of pulp fiction alien aliens psycho grindhouse etc not really i think the movie has lost itself in the hype and most of the people who gave it a 10 did so because they didnt understand half the movie but thought it looked cool i think the movie would sit nice with a 6 or 7something rating but thats my opinion anyway i will be not be seeing any more films in this version of the series so you wont hear from me about it again negative,even though i see these films as pseudo intellectual tripe intentionally made for popcorn peasants who equate style with substance and gravity with gravitas i think there is a something to take seriously about the effect the series is having on less psychologically stable individuals here is the problem no one really wants to equate horrific social acts with the ideal of liberty or the influence of the arts this is a problem because it is the essence of rational thinking to question aspects of our condition such as the possibility that the very things we hold dear are the things that can hurt and scar us the deepest there are droves of people willing to attack religious texts as a direct influence on violent behavior but seemingly few people who will even dare suggest that films can affect behavior in a similar manner yes religious writings are presented as truth where films are generally not but to a person lost in psychological disease there is probably little difference between truth and fiction the dark knight is a film where the central antagonist is presented as highly charismatic and successful in his purposes he is given a significant amount of screen time several stylized monologues and essentially tears apart all semblance of morality and meaning the protagonists cherish the joker is a glamorized nihilist antihero who wins in the end he is given all of the best lines is never contradicted and almost all of the filmmakers intentions seem to be focused on this one singular performance above and beyond all others he is also however impossible a creation a realistically and seriously portrayed one much like se7ens john doe or silence of the lambs hannibal lecter the joker is the ultimate role model for people who are antisocial insecure and disturbed he has been crafted with care and projected into the minds of any and everyone living in a society that is reeling from media saturation and spiritual and moral confusion like it or not we are animals living in a self made zoo and we are dramatically influenced by the media and artistic expressions we are exposed to from infancy through our development into adulthood at which point we remain spectators or begin to color the depths with our own dreams and nightmares but profiting egotistically and or financially from cathartic or theoretical expressions of violent and socially conflicted issues without acknowledging the potential for negative influence and therefore the serious social responsibility of such expressions is the way of our post modern world it is reckless and selfish and it is the american way i understand that the director of this film is british but the dark knight is clearly designed for an american audience we dont want to have any restrictions on our public fantasies as producers or voyeurs we are afraid of the assumed slippery slope from censorship to fascism and we hold the ideal of freedom above even the quality of our own lives we are taught not to value sacrifice and to drink deep from the abyss because we are irrational animals first and our morals are those of convenience we are not culpable because we are unaware given absolutely incontrovertible empirical evidence that films can desensitize demoralize and cause specific acts of violence to occur would we be willing to sacrifice our entertainment and our liberty for the welfare of the whole of the species absolutely not and why should we but we are not in control of anything we are not free at all and our ideals are no more empirically substantial than our religious beliefs the only solution for those of us who are aware and concerned with societal health is to attempt to illuminate others and force an acknowledgment of these realities so that we can attempt to cope with the inevitable moral decay mass secularism and technological progression are causing not that i could ever demystify the joker character for those who find him heroic or impressive beyond the superficiality of the actors performance but as an afterthought i am adding something i produced as a reaction to the disturbing level of influence the character has had on people because honestly speaking the character is an idiot for whatever it is worth the interrogation scene between batman and the joker in an actual intellectual though overly verbose film joker bla bla bla nihilistic bs bla bla darwinian pseudo truth bla bla sociopathic nonsense masquerading as deep social truism bla bla bla‰Û_ batman heres the truth pal we are both chemically drawn to opposing behaviors which we ultimately have little or no control over you are compelled to associate civilized humans as violent animals living a lie of illusory morals and to enjoy causing negative awareness and pain i am compelled to see humans as violent but altruistic animals by nature and to help heal the whole by attacking those who cause disease and pain like fighting cancerous cells in a body even as you mock the species for a perceived moral dishonesty you must rely on a type of moral perspective in order to justify your own position over the position of another your attempt to call people out on being flawed animals simply because you have a more introspective awareness is simply an appeal to your chemical predestination over the nature of others you have no point to make moral or otherwise once you have chosen to eliminate the idea of meaning from existence you are no different than a moth drawn to a flame you possess no special knowledge from which you can imagine me detracted from my own goals if anything i am more honest in my attempts to herd the flock into healthier areas of behavior because we are biologically a social species and biology is our master then batman smashes the jokers face into the table to drive his point homenegative, this film is bad in the sense that it is hardly a film at all it has no structure no dialogue no screenplay a threadbare story but one that is not told because of non existent direction etc it continues where the original left off and just notches off plot elements one by one without any urge to tell a story or develop characters relationships etc the makers probably conceived this as a filler between numbers one and three and didnt bother with it of course thats all right i dont have any problem with that but what really does disturb me is the high praise meted out to this film from almost every quarter ‰ÛÒ from viewers and critics alike on this board its being rated as the 17th best movie of all time ive consulted quite a few film guides and they all tag maximum or near maximum stars to this film even more bizarrely they consider it to be the best of the series and in my mind its clearly the worst what is going on of course its not difficult to see why this film is idolized the first film was both good and a milestone not great but it was the perfect statement for an age it was a fairy tale that was confused as science fiction the force embodied morality even religion for the space age it is set in the distant past and therefore pertains to origins rather than where technology is going spaceships and laser guns are just the backdrop and have nothing to do with the story or the subject matter when this film appeared in the middle of the crisis ridden seventies it really must have been a beacon of new hope and to put the ground breaking special effects into its proper context they symbolized optimism there is no doubt that the effects served the story well but they served even better the mood of the age and with all this going star wars rightly became a tremendous hit and the focus of fanatic devotion it was to be expected that any sequel would have been gobbled up by the fan base as long as it didnt spoil the original empire doesnt spoil the original it not only continues the war between good and evil it does so with more spectacle more aplomb more special effects when people say they like empire what i think they really mean is that thy like star wars so much that they are thrilled that it has a new and glossy wrapping because empire is nothing but embellishment theyre not judging the film itself the ideal situation would have been if star wars remained as a standalone fairy tale fairy tales end and they leave us with the aura of happily ever after they dont go on and on and become sagas and if they did that would totally destroy the aura empire is the first mistaken step towards saga and that is why it quickly finds itself out of its depth there is nothing else to be told and thats why the film is so bad one boring battle joined to another boring battle and in between we have cardboard characters mouthing atrocious dialogue that serves no purpose whatsoever the strain tells everybody is straining to do something when there is nothing to do the third film the return of the jedi redeems itself by trying to finish a story the prequels are interesting because they are filling in the background but empire is caught in no mans land it is bad and it should be exposed as such all this pretending isnt healthy i dont think negative,talk about a bad mainstream movie bad acting and terrible choices of scenes to have in the movie by peter jackson its a shame its on the 2th place when great movies like lost in translation is much further down sure the movie contains some really great effects and some okay acting but i mean the end oh my god was it really necessary to have 4 ending scenes if you still like these kind of movies why dont you guys go and see star wars at least their acting and characters is a lot more fun and those movies are also contains nice scenes relating to the time they were made this shouldnt be seen as an offense to either peter jackson nor tolkien because they are both great but still the movie didnt really work out ickashnegative, many people justify jacksons drivel by saying that everyone interprets the books differently jackson however not only adapted tolkiens story but created his own he removed tolkiens dialogue and replaced it with hackneyed banter he replaced scenes of drama and suspense with slapstick and hamboning the majesty and dignity of characters such as gimli aragorn sam frodo gollum and theoden almost all the characters really are reduced to snivelling whimpering and slapstick jokes arwen elrond and galadriel the most noble characters in the series are reduced to whimpering fools the disrespect that jackson shows for the characters makes clear the lack of interest he has in faithfully presenting tolkiens work tolkien after all related to his characters so closely that he had their names engraved on his own tombstone it is insulting to tolkiens memory to deal with his characters with such irreverence considering how much he cared about them its insulting to tolkiens memory while many dispute this i find the movies to be amateurish and the special effects are mediocre considering the heights of computer generated effects that other studios have reacheddespite the rave reviews it gets making a mediocre movie isnt really a sin in itself making a bad movie and claiming that it has any relationship to tolkiens work however is movie gets one star out of ten but its more deserving of zero that people have read tolkiens book and yet find any similarity or value in jacksons movies baffles me they are without merit being poorly made and completely disrespectfully adapted from the books jackson has not merely spit on tolkiens grave he has forever tainted his legacy with his awful interpretation of his work negative, okay i realize that this movie is considered by many to be a great film i understand that they are extremely faithful to the novels and this pleases many fans what i do not understand is how anyone can say this film is better than the godfather ii and even one spot away from the first godfather go take a gander at the imdbs top 250 and youll see that this movie is only marginally below the shawshank redemption i mean cmon someones gotta figure out a way to balance the rating system here all thats going on is these movies cult of scary and weird followers sit in their dank cold basements on the internet and vote these films a 10 when in the grand scheme of things theyre really more of a 6 7 or maybe an 8 im sorry but no matter how great these movies may seem theyre little more than a cgi fest of monsters armies and magical beams this film cant hold a candle to the intense drama of michael corleones criminal empire holding power in 1950s las vegas cmon imdb viewers lets keep the ratings reasonable negative,this film won 11 oscars including best picture the return of the king is an awful film at well over three hours it is an exercise in boredom orlando bloom and viggo moretensen are completely miscast the story does not make sense and the characters are contrived it is like playing a bad video game so many actors are wasted in this colassal disaster peter jackson winner of the best director academy award seems as though he thought that his film was too precious to edit the film goes on and on and on weak acting all around the film relies on special effects to cover for a script that is completely pretentious the musical  is like listening to someone scratching a chalkboardnegative,obviously this was a faithless and pointless butchering of the novel but whats worse a terrible movie lacking flow sense linearity and dramatic impact this played out like a highlights reel not a coherent story the actors did an admirable job with the awful dialogue and nosensical personalities they were given with some exceptions peter jacksons only two abilities seem to lie in super close up and super wide out shots both of which are heartily abused and the special effects for the most part would have been better served by a cardboard set and some directing ability there were high points but this was and is the first and only movie i have ever left before the end and they barely kept me there but for the eowyn nazgul scene a hollywood blockbuster no doubt a good movie hell no possessing anything in common with the literature it is supposedly based on the fact is if this were based on real events i dont think the people involved would have given them to right to use their real names maybe that wouldnt be such a big deal if i didnt have to hear about jacksons love of the books or read reviews that discuss staying true to the source material there is hardly a scene or underlying theme in the movie that has anything to do with the books this movie could probably have been worse but i would be hard pressed to know hownegative,i honestly dont know what to say this has got to be the worst movie ive ever had the misfortune to watch and yet its getting such good reviews why anyone would give it a rating above 5 is a mystery to me is almost everyone on imdb just wannabe critics or is there actually something that i just missed while watching this i found it a challenge just to get through the movie never mind enjoy it my advice to anyone thinking of watching this dont it will only disappoint you there is no real plot or storyline and the movie is very disengaging characters and events are boring to follow and personally i feel that there are plenty more movies more deserving of the credit this movie is givennegative, does godfather romanticize crime and criminals yes it does take for instance the godfathers name corleone which translates as lionhearted suggesting that the heroes are to be compared to richard the lionhearted legendary chivalrous hero of the crusades and friend to robin hood there can be no doubt that author mario puzo and director francis ford coppola have made romantic idols of the corleones as the film gilds them with mystery honor and gallantry but of what holy crusade are the corleones the leaders seemingly a war for survival against vicious enemies who would destroy their gang but why should we care what happens to a bunch of evil criminals godfather is just as much interesting for what it fails to show the audience as what it does show the film makers wrongly assume that the audience is sophisticated enough to infer the kind of lurid but educational scene that made such a great success of earlier gangster films nitty gritty illustrations of the inside workings of organized crime loan sharking extortion and vice godfather for the most part ignores this subject matter the everyday business of crime in favor of what should be only the end part of its story a war between gangs over control of the rackets the drama is essentially without motivation the movie is simply not interested in showing us much of the dirty business that is the reason for the war that is because the heroes would seem much less chivalrous if their criminal enterprises were shown in any depth or with any real understanding for most of its length the movie plays as a revenge tragedy in which the gallant protagonists could be members of any great family whether criminal or not protecting their cherished honor why did the film makers deliberately sanitize the criminal aspect of the corleone family are they apologists for crime i think they are one confidence game employed by the film makers which is also familiar among the annals of organized crime leaders is a variation on the trick called bait and switch we expect a portrait of a ruthless and immoral criminal instead we are made to believe in the essential moral rightness of don corleone when he condemns as a contemptible enemy the kind of criminal who trades in narcotics in other words we are lured into the theater with the promise of a true to life depiction of the actions of a bad guy and then the film makers slyly pull a fast one and show us a good guy instead we are persuaded to ignore the fact that the godfather is an extortionist and pimp ‰ÛÒ even worse we are asked to believe that extortion and pimping are not so bad especially if practiced by an honorable guy like don corleone who whatever his failings is much too decent to trade in narcotics this jiggery pokery was so effective that around the time the movie and its sequel came out an ivy league educated friend of mine on his way to a brilliant career on wall street bitterly denounced a critic of godfather for making the claim that don corleone was not entitled to be regarded as a great hero like president franklin delano roosevelt general douglas macarthur or doctor albert schweitzer who had received similarly adulatory treatment in film my friend having seen both godfathers was convinced that a mafia leader might be just as honorable as the heroic portrait the movies presented so i feel some need on this occasion to remind the public of what the mafia does even when they allegedly refuse to get involved in narcotics sales the mafia is mainly in the business of vice it feeds off the weaknesses of a mass of little people who are corruptible who are vulnerable to the appeal of easy sex cheap thrills quick money and quick fixes of their problems these little people pay for their vices all their lives much more than they can afford to pay and end up ruined for the greater glory of the mafia most racket crime is not glorious it is petty and mean and easily committed by anyone who has less courage or daring than the average person but its easy to understand why the film makers left this out of the movie it would be kind of absurd to call a scuzzy dirtbag by the name lionheart negative, simply put pulp fiction is the silliest film i have every seen it puts battlefield earth and the long kiss goodnight spookily starring the two leads from this film firmly in the shadows they look like rare vintage wines next to this cheap plonk the fact it is so highly revered by so many and even considered profound makes me fear for the very existence of modern society there are some fundamental reasons i dislike this film with a passion the first being the pacing and substance the film really mirrors its director to perfection yapping and a mumblin and a stumblin from start to finish enthusiastically aboutnothing if qentin was not such an untalented cretinous buffoon i would call him the new david lynch the only substance in pf is of the white powdery verity the film is just a collection of sick images splashed on screen willy nilly strung loosely together by some sharp but pointless dialogue the film was too crude made purely for shock value when violence male rape drug abuse accidental shootings and other such fun filled things are packaged as cool and even as comedy in the hands of an immature director you get a highly irresponsible film and to sell it as some sort of smart art piece is doubly irresponsible then there is the complete lack of character development and depth there are no characters only 2 dimensional machines created solely to perform acts of severe violence and drop in a few wise cracks they perform actions in one scene that seem to have no effect or relation to what happens in their next scene not one of them is even slightly likable or in possession of any redeemable characteristics apart from perhaps butch willis did i mention he is a violent thug murderer and a thief then there is mia who seems to have little purpose in the film other than an excuse to include the very uncomfortable scene where an over weight travolta boogies on the dance floor yes she is in the famous needle scene as well but what else the section featuring vince and mia was just dropped and barely mentioned again like mia herself so what was the point a question i asked of the film throughout i quickly realised that nobody in the film was there to be developed any one of them could have been dropped apart from butch or their actions performed by a completely new character without making a spot of difference to the film their actions were not to be the subject of scrutiny that would be asking too much of the tarantino who is clearly only interested in attempting to make stuff look cool he is the most unoriginal man on the planet only capable of tacky homage ie he is a thief action films dont believe me watch kill bill where he even pays homage to his own film this one i do give credit to him in one respect he realised that if he re jigged the order of plot events he could not only look artistically swish but he could disguise the fact that the story is not worth the toilet paper it was written on impressing upon many the fallacy that the hack job narrative structure enhanced the story the direction is experimental but quite frankly tacky and laughable at times one scene featuring a near comatose butch in particular comes to mind the camera is stuck dead still on him while marsellus rhames uses the m f word 100 times in about 5 minutes totally amateurish the only memorable performance is from jackson who could make the ingredients list of a packet of cookies sound fun he is offset by a flat performance from travolta that brings me to the witty dialogue which apart from the violence is the crux of the piece it is unfortunate then that this dialogue basically consists of idiots talking a load of nonsense about such deep things as cheeseburgers milkshake foot massages cleaning up skull and brain chunks and some coffee that is described as gourmet st some dialogue was witty but mostly it was just utterly pointless the characters deliver it with such perceived style and coolness despite the fact they were talking about frankly a lot of bs add this to the fact there is barring brief moments in butchs story no plot no emotion and especially no substance and you have one worthless film ah you dont get it they all scream dont make me laugh the circular narrative and the ham fisted attempt at redemption at the end does not equal substance the ending was hilariously cheap obviously a desperate attempt to justify a pointless 2 hour string of images in one strike is it meant to be profound well after sitting through the whole film which consisted of characters that were never developed adequately where no actions or events were properly tackled challenged or explored with any great thought or depth during which i was never required to care even once i was presented with one of the most cheesy pointless monologues in film history oh and a parody of qts fans the briefcase is opened and they stare at the shiny thing and go ooooh it beautiful it is all a hollow gesture when you consider the character that delivers the speech and his actions directly following it combined with the entire sequence of stupid events that precede it many movies these days suffer similar problems at their conclusion because of obvious limitations in plot structure and development some have endings that invalidate the rest of the film others have endings that are invalidated by the rest of the film with pulp fiction qt has somehow achieved both simultaneously youll figure out what i mean as a rule i dont usually let a films director put me off the film itself but after kill bill and pulp fiction tarantino films are now the exception negative, while the first two films of the trilogy where very good in my opinion the third one is a complete catastrophe in every aspect one can think of its attitude towards the book and without the book no one would have heard of peter jackson except few admirers moves between insult to ignorance almost no text from the original survives and the characters and scenes are terribly distorted even the climax scene is changed from the genius of tolkien to a bad holiwoodic clich‹© the most disastrous is what the movie does to the character of frodo which from the original tragic hero becomes a stupid and gullible fellow which does nothing expect stupid things the go home sam scene should be candidate to one of the worse movie scenes ever other characters such as denethor faramir aragorn theoden or elrond are either inconsistent irrational stupid badly acted or all of the above in addition unlike the beautiful design of the middle earth in general in the first movie or of rohan in second there is nothing left from gondor except one picture of minas tirith and few fires it amazes me that not only this film is considered excellent by many viewers but that it is considered the best of the three negative,sorry but i cant believe that this is the most popular film it dragged on for so long i didnt even see the ending dont get me wrong i love gangster films but this was so unengaging and that by the time al pacino shot the bad copper i had to turn off the storyline just seemed to be so pointless that i didnt care about whatever happened to the characters how stupid is putting the horses head in the moviemakers bed he knew they were dodgey gangsters so why did change his mind i cant think of any reasons why this was a good film if you do then you better tell menegative,this is everything i dont want to see in a movie when i watch a movie i would at least hope for it to be more excited than my own little existence at my little house in the dead of winter id rather watch paint dry and its as if they did it all on one take the acting is the only halfway descent thing about it and thats because of the obvious triple a lineup this movie is very boring flat out i have seen more action and better writing in a spanish daytime drama there seems to be about 8 9 short films one after the other with only slight relevance to one another while me and my wife hated this movie we love all of the inside jokes we play about with each other now like how when we go out for icecream and we get a cherry my wife dramatically sucks and licks the cherry for 5 minuets making fun of the jackrabit slims scene i actually highly recommend watching this movie so you can see how horrible it is for yourselfnegative, not being a dork or geek the mystique of these movies are lost on me so here is a review from someone that actually had dates in high school and didnt play d&d every friday night long lame sword fights to win a sword fight with the orcs all you need to so is step aside and cut them across the chest then as an alternate you can spin and run your opponent through i figure me and four other people could effectively wipe out a million of these lame fighters for this reason alone i give the movie a thumbs down the special effects were perhaps the best ive ever seen great monsters and landscapes is it just me or were most of the characters in this story gay just look at the way froddo looks at sam and vice versa pure lust in their eyes then there was this albino vulcan who always made double entandres toward a midget with a big nose he was obviously gay then there was the way gondorf kept touching the hobbits is this guy a priest anyway i give this movie a thumbs down it had the longest ending of any movie ive seen people were saying it it over yet but no it kept on going and going like the energizer easter bunny peter jackson is purely b list in my opinion there thats from a cool guy later negative,i pretty much hated this movie its a prison movie so plot is basically tim robins gets framed than raped and eventually escapes morgan freeman is locked up and i dont know he just acts like a kid in this i understand hes suppose to be locked up since he was a teen but really hes giving the same performance here as his role as god in bruce almighty even though hes miscast he honestly carries the movie mainly because tim robins does nothing in this movie some other subplots include tim teaching some idiot to read or something some old guy hangs himself they deck a rooffreeman sneaks in a hammer and robins makes chess pieces ill stop the the point im making is this movie is excruciatingly boring number one on imdb are you kidding me even from a technical standpoint this movie blows everything is just dull and unimpressive hell it looks more like a tv movie than a film id describe the tone of this as disneys take on jail movies its to concerned with being safe and classy to accurately represent prison life everyones favorite part of this is the ending and that sucked too tim robins apparently escapes prison with a rock hammer after digging through his cell wall for like twenty years his hiding place is a poster really to make matters more hilarious he has crawls through a tunnel of poop and emerges from a poop lake in a failed attempt to move the audience morgan freeman gets paroled by basically insulting the judges than he goes to a rock in some random place that tim told him to visit and than goes to mexico and finds tim on a boat reunited and roll credits oh yeah morgan freeman also married his step granddaughter thats the dumbest ending ever written theres so much better stuff you could be watching instead of shawshank like porn or riki ohnegative, yes thats right crap this film is just that if you take a closer look at fex bruce willis who seems to make people scream their head off every time hes near the screen you can clearly see that this person lacks personality he has two expressions one that says on with a little wrinkle above his nose the other is of course off when hes asleep a machine of a man which perhaps cries a bit when he comes home because hes in desperate need for a personality some feelings a higher iq and an even bigger paycheck why this person has become so popular has to do with you mindless people out there voting cheering and stamping your feet for talentless and retarded actors musicians artists etc that is why this world goes straight down the toilette making your modern remarks that everything is so cool all the time pulp fiction is at best a bad joke from a below average director there is no inventions no good or natural acting no deeper meaning with this movie at all just exploitation the era of good movie productions are long gone classic actors like chaplin bogart cooper peck holden and quinn dont get born any more today its just you gray and unpersonalized people out there with some exceptions watching to see if theres something that can kill your brain even more with splatter and gore above your ears yeah youre a really cool bunch drowning on dry land negative,sucked in by the tremendous hype surrounding this movie i went with eager anticipation as i waited and waited for something to happen in this long winded spectacle of gore i found myself laughing only to break the tension i was ashamed for finding humor in the most inappropriate moments of this film over indulgent pop icon quentin tarantino should head back to the video store so as not to inflict this kind of mess on innocent filmgoers againnegative, pulp fiction is a mess of a movie gratuitously violent and indulgent everyone wants to talk about the humour of going over a bump and someone being shot how hilarious is that this comment is meant to be ironic i note this for the hollywood saturated brain dead to call it a classic requires calls for major surgery on the definition the film is really just a sign of a sick culture stay away from it the irony wasnt lost on me the problem is that it was of the sledge hammer variety there are so many good films that i am at a loss to see why this is chosen for special consideration and to make matters worse the editor on this programme insists i use american spelling goodness get a life program with me on the end of it was still english last time i looked negative, this is a picture about mindless killing and idiots who think it is funny why so many people think highly of this picture is entirely beyond my fat rear end the fact that so many people rate this picture so highly does not say good things about our society in general when i bring up how disgusting this picture is to people whom love it i get a multitude of answers that amount to nothing more than academic masturbation some people have the audacity to say it is a comedy somehow i never thought mindless killing and standing around and laughing about it was comedy ha ha ha ha he just got his head blown off  that was so damn funny that i cant stop laughing other people say its a serious satire its supposed to show you the way the world really is wow like i need to waste my time and money to tell me we live in a sick world simply put if you like this film you need to get your head examined negative,i hate mob movies and even though this is a classic the genre means it is less than desirable mob movies have one thing in common they are slow their main theme is character development and the characters they develop are not worth knowingnegative, this movie was terrible long and boring both my wife and i hated it i love star wars the old ones i am told i am just not a fantasy fan but i think i am just not a fan of badly done commercialized fantasy if i want to see a documentary on new zeland landscape i will rent it the movie should tell a compelling story with 20 characters and none of them even close to well developed i had no attachment to any of them yes i did not read the books i actually read the hobbit as a kid and loved it and remember it well i think they were just too true to the books and didnt realize that the books dont make a good movie unless you have read and loved the books call me the grinch i am not harsh on most movies all my friends love this movie and are avid fans i have no idea how it is anywhere in the top 250 maybe i could say this is a decent flick if you have nothing mildly stimulating to watch some weekend or need a decent rental my wife walked out of this movie i bared through it in the theaters just to give it a chance i would never rent it dont bother dragonslayer from back in the day does it much better and with triple the drama and action negative,before walking into this movie i really had great expectations what with the rave reviews the movie was being lavished with and the seemingly awesome trailer and then came the moment of truththe movie was very ordinary i saw nothing special in this movie for me to even remotely praise it it was long many gaps in the plot in addition to scenes and story lines which seemed senseless and had no follow up plus there really was nothing artistic about it and it didnt actually have the enjoyable cinematic experience moviegoers would want to relish in this was further aggravated with the poor lines in the film in short the movie didnt get me all excited or sucked me into it throughout the entire film i was hardly able to connect to the film that said however i wouldnt recommend folks to not watch it but just an advice to keep your hopes to a minimal pointnegative,bad parts of this movie the action scenes sucked other than at the beginning the action scenes consisted of the joker saying something stupid batman hitting him the joker hitting him back and then walking away and something exploding in a good movie the good guy is supposed to be a little weaker than the bad guy and has to overcome it but batman has radar vision and can fly while the joker has nothing but a knife this movie was not inspiring what does it inspire me to do pay a british douche a lot of money so i can dress up in robotic bat suits and catch criminals speaking of the bat suit if part of batmans sacrifice is that the city hates him then why does he have a special uniform if youre supposed to be hated by everyone wear a ski mask and stop advertising yourself if you are trying to be loved by the people then you can advertise the movie created so many dumb unimportant plot lines and nothing ended up happening right after the love triangle the girl died that guy said he was gonna reveal batmans identity but nothing happens there was so much that didnt make any sense how does one guy in hong kong do the accounting for all the criminals in gotham why is it the biggest problem in the world that 5 people were killed in 5 days thats better than things are usually in big cities why dont the gangsters the joker is talking to kidnap him etc the joker wasnt creepy there is nothing creepy about a guy wandering around in face paint and giggling if he walked in to a bar cut a guys head off and then ordered a salad that would be creepy a superhero should be a superhero because he did something cool batman is a superhero just because hes rich good parts the creditsnegative,this movie has toppled all the records and currently ranked number 1 on imdb rankings this really makes me doubt about how imdb ranking works and are we the people so gullible to the advertisement campaigns that we have rated this film this high i must say this that the film as such is not bad it is the best film so far this year however it does not qualify to even come near to other masterpieces if it is not for heath ledgers excellent performance i would have rated this film even lower to tell the truth i liked the prequel of this film better the film is lengthy and melodramatic eg the scene where inmates and civilians want to decide if they want to blow off other ship message was good but the way it was delivered is little bit childish also transformation of harvey dent seems sudden and illogical nolan should have developed this character better if harvey does what he does after the death of his beloved he should be avenging joker the most important part where joker convinces him to be an anarchist just like him is written poorly all in all it is a good movie excuse me but far from masterpiecenegative,there are some things in this life we will never understand how did the universe begin what happens to our souls when we die how did a movie as bland as the shawshank redemption become so overrated in the case of certain other movies i can at least understand the reasons why theyre overrated but the shawshank redemption is so average and clich‹© ridden the films moral is basically that hope is important and theres nothing wrong with that in itself heck i have no problem with simplicity the problem is when you move past the simple and into the land of the simplistic the movie treats its borrowed plot parts count of monte cristo anyone and banal themes as though they were freshly minted nuggets of wisdom i wouldnt be complaining if it didnt pretend to be anything more than a pleasant diversion however it is with its very last shot that the movie reveals its true condescending colours if it had ended moments earlier instead with that poetic shot of the sea i would have had some respect for it thats where the superior original story ends but no the director had to spell things out for his audience frank darabont knows how to tell a story he just doesnt know how to tell one with any originality or depth the movie is partially redeemed by three things the majestic cinematography the powerful  and most of all morgan freeman one of the very best actors working today as for my rating yes im one of those jerks who gives a movie a 1 just to lower it on the top 250 i think its outrageous how highly its ranked here even the folks who made it would think its ridiculous to consider it one of the greatest films ever madenegative, after reading all the rave reviews for this movie it turned out to be a real disappointment can anyone really believe that the prisoners are honourable men while the guards and warden are all crooks havent we overdone the hypocritical bible thumper  lets find a more enlightened characterization james bond himself could not have followed the main characters escape plan the ending soliloquy and denouement were inferior plagiarisms from cool hand luke enough unfortunately fine performances by both robbins and freeman were wasted in this fantasy story negative, shawshank redemption is overrated its a decent above average film but by no means a great film the inmates are pretty much likeable while the warden and his pet guard are monsters also as freemans character says you know that everybody in heres innocent as the story develops you feel like he is right the only criminals are the ones guarding the prisoners this is a sentimental piece made to stir the emotions but not to stir them too much just enough to make the viewer feel there is injustice in the world but that in the end everything ends well and justice surely comes to he who waits 20 years or so for it the shawshank redemption is as i said a decent film possibly among the top five films of 1994 imo the best films of 1994 are pulp fiction and l‹©on negative, three words cool hand luke same film done better done earlier for that matter is this film any better than other steven king novelettes such as stand by me all in all it probably ranks a 6 or a 7 but since people on this site have lost their minds as regards this film i give it a 1 in one mans attempt at sanity negative, wait until you see the atrocity that is the dark knight and you will see it no matter what i say anyway wont you ive tried to keep this spoiler free despite the fact that whatever unpredictability the moth eaten plot has is based on the surprise being completely inexplicable in context so forgive me if its a bit vague in places the latest batman film lauded by fan and critic alike was apparently replaced at my theater with another similarly titled film in which iron man fought the killer from saw who is intent on reproducing the last ten minutes of spiderman ii over and over again everyone in the film is either an idiot or an omniscient genius but either way they are the most unobservant bunch of people ever put on film the whole movie would have sputtered to an instant conclusion if the city cell phone network had gone down and even the simpsons has lampooned the only bridge out of town and the first moment batman is on screen he is bending the barrel of a gun unto a u shape i think somebody was looking on the wrong page of their comics reference guide when they wrote all of the super strength + flying scenes in for batman this is an idiot picture there was no set piece in this film that would not have been avoided by a modicum of common sense honestly kudos to heath ledger whoever he was playing that was impersonating the joker as someone with no apparent sense of humor but any normal person would have shot the man on sight just to stop him babbling for the next twenty minutes every freaking scene was a monologue of the same thing everyone did that actually the characters seldom had conversations just extended monologues which aspired to be weighty and philosophical and not a word they said mattered because in the end it comes down to punching someone anyway the joker has only one trick and it is the same one three or four times bales characterization of batman and bruce wayne is so lifeless he doesnt even seem to have been in the film technically it suffered from being heavily edited apparently to obtain a pg 13 rating killings appear off screen or in obvious jump cuts events are alluded to which not only do not occur but appear to occur differently was this the airline version how long would this thing have been as shot it already exceeded two and a half hours happily there was plenty of opportunity for bathroom breaks every time someone opened their mouth you had ten minutes free still sloppy editing cannot excuse the way characters simply appear and disappear as needed by the script regardless of the impossibility of getting there unnoticed iits is essentially a plot device if this seems like a litany of nitpicks without mention of all the good points well as far as i can tell i mentioned all the good pointsthis film viciously wasted my time as if i was a character in it trapped in a theater with fifty hitherto unnoticed oil drums and the option to explode the audience of wall e it would have been a mercy iits its in the script thats why concept created by ken begg negative, i finally saw this movie because everyone kept talking about it but for anyone who has seen more than a few movies ie somebody over 20 there is just nothing there even without the hype i found this movie to be really painfully bad a few points  it seems the movie is trying to be realistic starting with something that looks like a somewhat believable heist but then there are so many totally improbable things like batmans hideout and gadgets the joker somehow getting zillions of minions etc so which is it a gritty crime movie or fantasy i cant tell  havent we seen witty dialog like this 100 times batman let her go joker oh very poor choice of words drops her out window when this happened my jaw dropped this is worse than a rambo movie  i get it that heath ledger playing the joker is supposed to be some crazy psycho hardly original or award worthy just looked like a hundred others we have seen before in other movies  all characters are totally off the shelf theres no depth or surprise to them at all  what does rachel dawes see in bruce wayne in the scene in the restaurant i own the place he seems like a braggart and feels the need to arrive at his own party in a helicopter with three arm candy women on his arm why isnt he already at his own place  oh look a fancy party in waynes penthouse i wonder whats going to happen look the bad guy comes in a starts tormenting people then wayne has to change into his batman costume to save the day how is this not 110% predictable  again is the movie supposed to be realist when arrested the joker would really be forced to wash the makeup off his face  bruce wayne saves the armored truck from a collision by placing his lamborghini in between it an on coming truck arent armored trucks stronger than sports cars yeah i know wayne has some magic tech so at this point we are supposed to suspend disbelief  i could go on obviously some people really like this movie thats great but please dont say its anything like the best movie ever until you have seen some films from the afis lists http wwwaficom 10top10 negative, this movie is not great its barley border line good the only two reason i cant think this was rated so high was the extremely high budget on 3d animation and the fact that people are so easily enticed by the name and actors now i am not insulting the books as i have never read them but other than what i stated what makes this movie so great is it the acting i dont really think orlando bloom can preform any other role take a look at both the lord of the rings and pirates of the caribbean is it climax i think even the people who didnt even read the book knew that from the first half of the first movie knew that the ring would be destroyed is it the characters it had all the basic characters for all movie storyline the only entertaining and not bland character was golem what is it that makes you think its in the league with schindlers list and casablanca i dont claim to know what the best movie ever is but i know this movie dose not rank high in greatness it only high in its budget negative, one of the dangers of being too literal of an adaptation is that you start to realize when seen in a different format what doesnt quite hold up such is the case with the second part of the dark knight returns which dramatizes the third and fourth books in the 1986 graphic novel at least in animated form it is clear that mr miller bit off just a bit more than he could chew with a final chapter that expands the playing field far beyond gothams borders it doesnt quite work taking us out of the intended story and using it as a way for miller to discuss a broader commentary on 1980s american foreign policy the original story was of course written in the mid 80s nonetheless those wanting a faithful adaptation of the iconic comic book will get their moneys worth as a filmed adaptation it is stymied only by a curious bit of miscasting and material that just plain doesnt work as well on the screen as it did on the page for the eight of you reading this who dont know the story this is the second half of the story which contains two distinct halves the first half which was always my favorite portion of the story concerns the jokers reemergence in gotham following the return of his arch rival while the finale concerns batmans proverbial end game and a conflict with superman the idea of superman being a tool of an oppressive american government a devils bargain so that he could still function as a life saving hero is an interesting one and it was certainly a groundbreaking narrative concept at the time but this is just one of many instances in the story where the perhaps necessary loss of the running first person narration hampers the film and removes some of the character depth the films final moments do pack the requisite emotional punch but it still feels just a bit like miller merely wanted to answer the age old who would win in a batman superman fight more disconcerting is the out and out miscasting of the joker never mind that the role of the aged harlequin of hate is tailor made for tim curry who was first cast as the joker 20 years ago on batman the animated series only to be quickly replaced in preproduction by mark hamill michael emerson doesnt sound the least bit old oh sure hes 58 years old but he looks and sounds like a spry youngster barely pushing 40 this is the same miscalculation that had angie harmon replacing stockard channing in batman beyond return of the joker the performances are fine in both cases but the fact that the vocals sound younger than they should is a constant distraction there are some surprising changes to the joker showdown spoilers i suppose moments where violence in the book is trimmed no dead boy scouts at the carnival that i saw and increased elsewhere the escape scene is on screen and joker shoots lots of people in the tunnel of love we frankly lose the idea that batman is tracking down the joker for the express purpose of finally killing him which lessens the impact of their final moments together its still a kick to see the joker doing what he does best but it lacks the pathos of its source material also frustrating is the sheer amount of time spent on two truly pointless action sequences the opening set piece involving an interrupted robbery that goes on forever and the first real confrontation between batman and the new commissioner seem to have no narrative purpose the latter rooftop smack down is egregious especially as batman seems to attack for no reason even as he should be keeping his ears tuned towards whatever the joker is up to just inside the building and considering that were dealing with two 75 minute cartoons there was no reason not to do a little judicious editing and release the whole thing as one 135 minute the dark knight returns aside from getting twice the money from consumers peter weller makes an ok aged batman but sounds oddly like olan soule ie batman on superfriends during his climactic speeches still if all you want is a straight ahead adaptation of the dark knight returns then youll probably walk away happy save for a few nitpicks here and there the film is splendidly animated and both parts have enough iconic comic panels replicated on screen to give hard cores the goosebumps the more character driven first half gives way to a more visceral and action packed final half while arguably a necessary evil the loss of the voice over narration also resulted in the sacrifice of much of the character depth in the process now that we have both parts i imagine part 2 may well play better as the second half of one 25 hour film but thats a discovery for another day for fans of the source material and general dcau junkies this is a worthwhile purchase ive never thought that the dark knight returns was the be all end all of batman stories and i still dont but its a damn good elseworld and these two blu ray releases mostly bear that out negative, this movie is not worth watching most certainly not worth paying the full price at the theaters i cant believe roger ebert gave it full four stars this is another blow to my confidence in his reviews and ratings the bad part about it is that ill have to find other ways to get reviews before going to see a movie the first thirty minutes of the movie seemed ok when the characters and the story is set up some action here and there mixed with the jokers evil ways then at about the 2 hour mark i wondered when it was going to be over its got way too much dialog and not a good one at that whenever the cameras got a closeup of batman played by christian bale empire of the sun with the mask and suit on i couldnt help but marvel at his mouth and his pronunciations its the lisp its like daffy duck jay leno and barney frank the gay politician from massachusetts its like the austin powers scene with the mole on the guys face he couldnt get over it i couldnt get over it the jokers mouth and the way he talked also got to me he kept licking his lips while talking it was ok at first but when he has so much dialog with so much lip licking one cant help but wander off and start to think about how the studio actually inserted the licking sound every time he did it i was licking my mouth i prefer jack nicholson if i had been by myself i would definitely walk out of this movie but i was with three other people i even considered just going outside and waiting for them thats how bad i didnt like this film the only thing that makes this movie tolerable for so long is the all star support which includes morgan freeman michael caine the cider house rules gary oldman the fifth element anthony michael hall sixteen candles johnny be good and eric roberts runaway train but even with these guys in the film its pretty bad if this movie is the best movie according to imdb i think its time to move on to other film sites negative, in one word boring get the comments people make about this movie you have those that say its innovative and controversial others that its violent and refreshing others that say its a rebellious masterpiece yes you can check it out absolutely all comments fall into such kind of comments why i have a theory those guys have never watched a good movie and i mean it violence gosh this movie was only less boring than natural born killers the worst movie ever made dont worry i have a good comment prepared for that crap also there is only one really violent scene in the whole movie when the pervert binds the boxer bruce and the other guy i cant even remember who was and prepares to torture them i cant remember if he actually does torture them but thats absolutely irrelevant the situation the characters are put into is what really matter and bruce choosing the sword when he escapes oh my that was really nice the only good moment in the whole movie wanna see lots of fake blood watch happy tree friends but do you want true violence watch spoorloos paraphrasing it if you think killing is the worst thing somebody can do you havent seen anything yet its absolutely amazing that crimes like rape and kidnapping are considered less severe than a murder in our civilization okay a murder is terrible but nothing compares to the suffering of those that survive not only the victims but also those around them pulp fiction is about terminating people without a good reason nothing more i see no violence in some idiot blowing up a nameless characters head mtvs movie awards parody of the car scene was excellent they really got the idea this movie only shows more fake blood than most hollywoodian movies but whats the point if it created a revolution in cinema it was to make it yuckier i have seen much more blood in hellraiser which by the way has blood and violence all tarantinos movies are too shallow to show true violence too bad imdb doesnt allow voting zero for a movie negative,i request to imdb please include 0 rating also atleast its soothing for people like us when they are able to express their opinion in the manner they want this movie does not deserve any rating at all if imdb group has something called best top negative comment for a particular movie then i request them to treat my comment as the top in that category that means i want my comment to be top from the bottom most of the time i watch movies only after checking the comments on the imdb website having seen such a good rating i rented this movie believe me not many times imdb comments proves so wrong this was the worst movie i have ever seen aaaaahhhhhh wait a minute i could not even see the whole movie all the time during the movie i was thinking that the good part is about to come but how was that possible good part would come only if there is any i am so surprised why so many people have reviewed this movie as one of the best movie they have ever seen total boring violent and logic less movienegative,i went to see rotk for the 2nd time yesterday and aside from the myriad of minor flaws want to concentrate on major issues surrounding jacksons character development aragorn is the first big problem in the book he is both a ranger from the north but also a man destined to be king he knows who he is and he has an expectation of that destiny likewise in the book he has spiritual awareness aragorn is descended not merely from men but from numenor so he already has in him some of the blood of the elves now jackson gives all foresight to the elves making the men merely men but the whole point is that the man born to be king has the spiritual awareness of the great kings of old thus in book ii at the river it is aragorn not legolas as in jacksons version who is aware of a shadow growing in his heart and more significantly it is aragorn who in the book takes the palantir by his right gandalf actually bows to give it to him gandalf counsels him not to use it but aragorn knows who he is so he looks in the palantir and shows sauron the sword he challenges sauron and then wrenches the palantir away from the eye to use as he wills not as sauron wills in so doing he sees the black fleet and so knows the threat thats why he takes the path of the dead and when he goes under the dimholt he really summons the dead the exchange in the film between aragorn and the geoffrey rush pirates of the caribbean look alike ghost is feeble in the film in the book aragorn does not doubt who he is he calls them not barters with them now aragorns action here is part of a much larger cohesion in tolkien that is entirely absent in jackson as a result were left with a desperately anti climactic coronation why theres simply been no character development of aragorn hes been denuded of a sense of who he is sauron is the next big problem its true that in the book he is mostly referred to as the eye but he also has personality in the film apart from the opening sequence to film i which was brilliant all we have is a plasma lamp sometime searchlight since in the book gandalf has told frodo that sauron is taking shape again why on earth didnt jackson then develop sauron from the figure in film i in the book we are told of saurons gnawing doubt we hear of reports about spies entering mordor we know that he is consumed by fear of the upstart heir of elendil none of this is developed in the film and the ring seems to lose power on entering mordor not gain it result there was no sense of elation at the fall of baraddur now this is a serious theological error that i suspect tolkien would have detested personify good and you must also personify evil tolkiens epic was all about those forces being personified and how you discern them sauron is a personification of evil hes not actually the worst that belongs to morgoth of whom the balrog is a servant whilst tolkien rightly loathed allegory he nonetheless never would have countenanced such a weak and ineffectual portrayal of the enemy the whole point and if this isnt obvious in the world today then jackson is even less astute than i imagined is that evil in many guises takes human form others the same lack of characterisation in aragorn and sauron goes on with many of the others notable exceptions are gandalf and saruman both well acted jackson made a mistake in cutting saruman out of iii having made so much of him in i and ii more than the book arwen is drippy throughout eowyn is changed in the film miranda otto was excellent but jackson plays up the love between her and aragorn so much that we are left wondering how eowyn is apparently beatifically happy to see him with arwen on the subject of eowyn its such a shame jackson didnt do the slaying of the witch king better in the book the battlefield pauses a cloud goes up and everyone in minas tirith is happy its one of the truly great moments lost by jackson the reports even leak back to the orcs in the tower above shelobs lair so that sam and frodo hear that no1 has been done in as for the hobbits i think this may be a question of preference personally i think sean astins acting as sam is execrable but some like it for me the simple gardener becomes a mini philosopher and i find his soliloquy both at the end of film ii in osgiliath to which they never go in the book and on the mountain twice truly toe curlingly dreadful pap im afraid and oh dear we even veered towards titanic music moments at the end of film i and again on the mountain bilbo was fine until the end yes we know he ages fast now hes lost the ring but the salieri style prosthetics are poor jackson loves the slow motion work so much that we have to endure some particularly dreadful sequences with the hobbits most notably the already infamous bed scene and at the end where i really thought frodo was going to give sam a full on smacker a similarly tacky piece of directing occurs when the elves appear the soft focus lens is deployed with celtic singing argh this is kindergarten film production i expect the film will garner the oscars ceremony but i hope some people in tinsel town have the courage to acknowledge that whilst some of the visuals are outstanding though many are not eg the oliphaunt descent by legolas the merrick style leader of the orcs and the army of the dead the film is not actually very good peter im afraid youve let us and jrr tolkien downnegative,ok i am not one of those people that hates films just because everyone else likes them i am not stupid i have two degrees a masters degree and a phd and i know a lot about films and agree with most of the top rated films on the imdb top films list however the thought of the godfather being called the greatest film of all time sickens me to believe that the only other film you must have watched must have been the people under the stairs the godfather is boring truly i love films but during this one i struggled to keep my eyes open i can take films at face value so i understand that maybe this film isnt supposed to be some fast paced shoot em up but it was so boring with so little character development and so little plot that i really didnt care what happened in this film ok so it is amazing how michael corleone takes over his dads role as head of the family why is it amazing who cares really there are so many other films with better character development i also hate the glorification of the mafias activities why should i be interested in how the son of a criminal and pimp takes over his fathers business and continues to terrorise and murder people if this film was about the the son of bin laden or one of the leaders of the bloods or the crips would people still be that interested i think that most of the people who like this film either like it because they feel they should or because they really cant justify their fascination with such a piece of crap and therefore revert to constructing deep and meaningful undertones to a film that clearly has none this film is a construct of the american fascination with the mafia and one of the longest on screen pieces of masturbation i have ever had the misfortune to witness if you like this film then fine but please like it for what it is a b rate gangster fantasy with no plot and very little character developmentnegative,i have to agree with those reviewers that find this film disjointed overly and unnecessarily violent and just plain difficult to understand i for one fail to see how this movie resurrected the career of john travolta as his performance was just totally unbelievable focusing on what appears to be several unrelated life experiences tarrantino once again utilizes his penchant for violence drug addiction rape and other assorted seedy topics the plot if you want to call it that is non existent and the scene involving ving rhaimes is just flat out disgusting for tarrantino fans this may be the ultimate but for me its just not a good filmnegative,this is one of the worst films i have ever seen the actors are good as is the cinematography and the editing but thats that the script is a bunch of completely rubbish lines with no real meaning and special effects that have been done thousands of times and arent interesting enough to keep our attention the  is distracting the villain is the most implausible villain i have ever seen people who do evil things have purposes the joker doesnt have any even if there was a person like that s he wouldnt be able to have minions because that kind of madness isnt a shared one people kill for power or revenge or money which is another type of power basically they have to have a purpose to unite and do evil things all of the bs the joker said about evil and good completely miss the point about good evil and humanity they simply dont make sense and what makes me furious is the fact that a lot of intelligent or at least more or less intelligent people are quoting those lines as if they meant anything they dont and they arent even entertainingnegative,what can i say i gave this thing a 1 because i honestly have never felt it was all that good i that saw the average was a 9 at the time i voted and i felt the dissenters should get some representation brando isnt all that great in it i mean the thing is better than the average film at least im supposed to believe that but 9 out of 10 no way watch different movies in fact watch other coppala movies i personally like the outsiders and the conversation better i find the story to be boring i also think the structure of the script is a little too gimicky and amateurish i wont go into detail on this i will just say the thing left me drynegative,honesly couldnt see what all the fuss is about i felt this film lacked the very basics which make a good film good actors boring story and even worse directing perhaps this is because i only watched the movie for the first time recently and therefore am comparing it to the standard set by todays writers producers and directors i dont doubt it was a masterful production in its day but honestly the bar set by current movie makers really sees the god father sorely outclassed it is my conjecture that those who voted 9 and 10 out of ten did so because they remember how good it was in its hay day instead of comparing it to all movies past and present before rating itnegative,this movie was horrible i dont understand how this is a good movie al pacinos worst movie marlon brando was horrible so many people say how good this is but i think this movie should be burned francis ford coppola is a bad director goerge lucas is the best director ever id give this movie a 30 on a 10 scale the best movie in the world is easily material girls hilary duff is so hot in that movie the screen play was bad the acting was bad and the director was bad a movie you should see is material girls the best movie ever good directing screenplay and defiantly acting another good movie was from justin to kelly justin is hot in his swimsuit but kelly needs to lose poundsnegative,the movie was good but to have it rated as the top 10 movies of all time is absurd if you are a child or you like movies that you just sit and watch like a zombie this is your top 10 movie come on a superhero move being in the top 10 are you kidding me i cant believe people are putting it in the same league the god father ss redemption lotr the list goes on and on i have to say the graphics are some of the best i have seen the actors played their parts great i just thought there was not much story line if you like movies with substance i would wait until it comes to a movie channel or videonegative, this movie is good but not the best movie ever made not even close to being the best movie ever made why has imdb allowed anyone and everyone to vote this is insane prestige by the same director and cast is far far farrrr better the background  is a killer thats what sets the mood of the entire film the movie should actually be called the dark clown because the joker is just one of the best characters played on screen in a long long time heath ledger has the soul of the character in his grasp as for batman where is he i hardly saw him negative, im giving this movie a number one not so much thats it awful but that its completely over rated you people on here need to get a grip with reality it makes me sick to see how out of hand everyone here has become with the death of heath ledger i come across many fans of heath ledger who tell me how great he is this movie and how he was so talented and how they were huge fans oddly not anyone can tell me that they have seen candy or much less even heard of it candy is i feel heath ledgers best role so for all you fans of heath ledger i recommend you take a look see at that one look the dark knight is a good movie but better than the godfather it will never be no matter how many 10s you give this movie negative,i saw batman begins and liked it although at the beginning i had a negative feeling for the dark knight i went to the movies with the greatest expectations after the big commercial that followed heath ledgers death everyone seemed to have liked it what a disappointment that was the movie is not bad but the critics make me hate it seriously i think that there are some movies ine the top #250 that are overrated but this one takes the cake from where i have to start the action scenes are nothing spectacular even tim burtons movie had better ones the music doesnt fit at the most of the sequences theres a repetitive tired to death theme that makes in almost every sequence thats the feeling i had batmans voice is like robocop is talking or something like that its not even clear what he is saying in some points i think it would be easier to say what i liked on this movie cause there are not many things i liked well heath ledgers acting was good although i think that jack nickolsons acting was more close to what i had in mind of joker character more sarcastic and funny in a crazy way heath made a good bad guy but he is more serious than a joker should be so why so serious avoid this movie there are a lot of better movies out there its just a trendy hype that i hope in some years will fade awaynegative,although suffering from a muddled plot ill defined characters a typically uncharismatic performance by christian bale and a lack of energy the dark knight proved to be on of 2008s greatest commercial and critical successes the fact that this film is in the top ten list tells me two things 1 most of the people who rated this highly are either 10 year olds or adults with the attention span of 10 year olds i do not mean to offend all 10 year olds because there are some rare exceptions but you can catch my drift 2 people who rated this highly have not seen many of the other better films on this list they have nothing to compare the dark knight to anyway i just hope this films current standing sinks down far below the 250 marknegative,christopher nolan is a great director he several great movies under his belt such as memento the prestige and batman begins i loved these and so when thats why i went to see the dark knight i expected something great i heard people praising it as a masterpiece or best movie in 10 years so i saw it major disappointment i walked out of the theatre befuddled so thats what the hype was all about although ledger completely owns the role of the joker and he gives a fantastic performance that must be seen the movie surrounding it is at times mediocre the pacing character arcs direction and impact of the movie are all flawed the ending was pretty terrible too its not a bad movie and id give it a 7 10 but i must vote a 1 because of all the fanboys that are blinded by the hype negative,a below average film which went on far too long heath ledger didnt completely fail at portraying the joker but to compare him with nicholson and favor him is insulting to both their careers hes essentially just playing a rather generic psychotic role in the mantle of the joker and cant really dazzle anymore after a scene or four christian bale is like a fossilized chunk of wood in his role as bruce wayne and as the batman just seemed to be in the wrong movie and desperately in need of some antibiotics michael caine and morgan freeman were fortunately able to add credibility to it all and when they appeared on screen the movie was actually pretty great pity though that they only got about 1 % of the movies screen time aaron eckhardt was given nada to work with and was equally wasted but who can really be surprised watching a movie like this just too many inane plot turns which just pulls you further and further away from wanting to find out where it all was heading i walked out after the 100 minute mark to get a smoke and just couldnt bother to walk back into the theater the evening was saved approaching a charming girl at the cinema bar serving ridiculously overpriced yet abhorrently tasting cocktails we ended up at her place and we danced to k&d until the first rays of morning sunlight found their way through the ragged drapes covering a cracked windowpane as she peeled of my clothes as if i was an overripe tangerine she whispered softly in my ear a mantra of passion film 1 night 4 negative,months after seeing this film all i can remember about it was heath ledger as the joker everything else melts away i cant remember anything about growly batman or lame two face i remember that there were way too many characters played by elderly veteran actors and maggie gyllenhaal looks like someones elbow and it felt like the film was ending so many times only to launch into a whole new chapter i know this is how comic books are written but the sprawling structure doesnt work as well in a film the storyline was messy only one star the jokernegative,another example of an over hyped movie but now in extreme to say this piece of junk should be regarded as the best movie of 2008 is ridiculous basicaly it is just another movie about a man in a bat suit who duels for more than 2 hours with another badman with a painted smile and in the process some quasi profound remarks are exchanged no humor in sight to make the movie better digestible big budget good actors and some clever make up artists are no guarantee for a good movie in this case it resulted in a very boring one as for the so called performance of the year by ledger he is was a very good actor but this one dimensional role is far from being special but i guess the oscar will be his nil nisi bonum why this movie should be on par with or far better than true masterpieces like the godfather 1&2 and vertigo is beyond beliefnegative,i really dont know what is on in this version of batman which made the record for all time box office it was the worst the batman voice is very gay trying hard to be male in every superhero movies leading lady always be on perfect look but not on dark knight there is only one truth it was totally dark the story was adapted from spider man 3 lack of batman gadgets cast was boring i cant see any good looking cast on every fight scenes batman really obvious that it was handled by a real martial art expert and not the actor itselfnegative,i went to see this godawful turkey because the reviews were good and i thought maybe there was something there worth seeing but alas my instincts were correct it was made to be delivered to the faithful who prefer their characters flattened out and wrapped in plastic against a blue screen delivering the usual predictable crappy comic book dialogue there goes another five or six hours ill never get back one of the worst aspects of this movie experience was the ever present omnipresent ubiquitous portentous ominous and and and redundant symphonic music every single second of screen time is infused with impending dread christian bale stares longingly into maggie gyllenhalls eyes tremulous haunting minor chords christian bale glances away at the darkened spires of gotham slow crescendo on b flat etcetera i guess this film was just marketed too effectively i was convinced and went the first batman film starred michael keaton as wayne which was an inspired casting choice much like casting robert downey jr as iron man it would be impossible i think for either downey or keaton to yield up a flat performance in this case though christian bales performance primarily grim determination has been flattened out to match the furniture leaving only heath ledger and of course michael caine still standing as convincing characters is that enough to make the film worth watching its up to you but a i knew it was the last i would see of ledger andb the script for michael caine just isnt that good on balance i cant recommend itnegative, sorry folksthis one gets the one star it is a great movie but the fact that it is number one on imdb is just an outrage i think one of the other posters on here said it best let me clear this if a movie can bring freshness to creativity if a movie happens to change your insights if a movie starts a new genre gives away new techniques and styles if a movie makes you understand your heart better then i call that movie a masterpiece as far as i see the dark knight is far from it heath ledger was the only phenomenal actor this movie is unoriginal end of story negative,until it drops below the godfather the good the bad and ugly and any number of other films that are just that bit better in an historical context this does upset me slightly as it is in itself a very good film as the other reviews say the ledger is dead batman fans just went a bit overboard with the 10 10 s at the start leaving us poor schmucks at the back of the queue to mark it down to where it should be what do i think honestly well 7s on imdb are usually a good watchable evenings entertainment 8s are things you would make a point of staying in for tipping or buying the dvd and anything 9+ is one of the best movies ever made yes this one is an 8something for sure as i would go out of my way to watch it again but the scoring correction continues so 1 star it is negative,ok dont know where to begin theres just too many things wrong with this dark knight 1st of all why does this movie have such high ratings because heath ledger died because if you actually watch the movie theres no reason for these high ratings the tim burton versions of batman in the 90s were a lot better than this hollywood plastic some random batman actions scenes a sloppy played joker that has nothing to offer than just to blow up police stations and hospitals wowhes such a clever joker he can blow up things i mean come on which part about this movie is good the atmosphere is not there  only 2 dimensions christopher nolan is doing his magic to make you sleepy because thats his magic gift to the world he can make me sleepy with movies like no other director but i guess im too old for this hype and only young people with really low iqs can enjoy this pile of rubbish i can only connect these 2 dots  1 low iq + 2 likes explosions = 90 rating on imdbwait and heath ledger died right yeah so imdb top ten movie right exactly negative,this middle oddity is a very laborious experience indeed its all life saver battles with an added dose of averageness thrown in to pad it out a bit dirk vader is seeking luke shytalker or whatever his name is its something along those lines anyway because he wants to cut him down with a swift blow from his life saver if he does not join him in wanting to rule the galaxy as dull and duller maniacal space duo anyway it all ends with dirk confronting shytalker in a life saver battle to the death dirk swings his life saver at shytalker shytalker swings his life saver back at dirk this goes on until either shytalker gets his hand cut off or the audience dont care anymore thats about it really not much here for real fans empire is nowhere near as good as its predecessor or indeed its sequel jedi both of which are truly engaging this one is notnegative,amazing special effects have been used to mask peter jacksons mangling of the original plotline and script warning this film is a prime example of a brilliant book being americanised ie hammered into the boy meets girl girl loses boy boy and girl reunite format it has a couple of elvish words thrown in to preserve an illusion of adhering to the original book but with aragorns american accent often intruding this performance is hardly spell bindingnegative,its an okay film epic and all of course the fact that its an epic like gladiator or troy doesnt mean its good troy proved that fact and alexander continued to prove it with one star antics to be quite frank peter jackson is an overrated director much like the lord of the rings movies are overrated movies if you notice all three are located in the top fifteen films this one happens to be ranked higher than greatly superiour films such as seven samurai schindlers list and even casablanca this is not the case with camera angles that make you sick utilising the admittedly beautiful landscape of new zealand to help push across into our heads the true epic feeling of middle earth but wait where are the interesting characters every one of them you feel so bored with by the time the first film is up you seem to hope that theyd be dead by the second one but no they come along to the third one to kick some sauron ass heres my view of lord of the rings a whole load of walking lord of the rings fellowship of the ring points there walks lord of the rings the two towers points there walks trips up walks on lord of the rings return of the king points there walks throws ring into mountain walks away take those completely identical scenarios and pile them up with useless plot for three to four hours per movie depending on which one you watch and i myself wouldnt touch the extended versions you really get the idea that the academy awards truly are flawed why look forrest gump won best film of 1994 instead of the shawshank redemption or pulp fiction titanic won best film of 1997 instead of la confidential and why lookey here lotr rotk won best ing film of 2003 instead of mystic river perhaps next year well have the constant gardener as the best film of 2005 that may actually redeem the oscars failing reputation a reputation that had truly fallen when they took this half arsed effort of a movie and worshipped it as best film negative,okay gandalf aragorn frodo are killed in the first ten minutes and sauron is king again that would be a good ending but no it drags on for another 3 hours and in the end everything is well and all goals are reached in between there are many fighting scenes where you easely get confused who is fighting against who and what exactly for the fighting is overdone and in all battles the good guys win boring and predictable the strongest warrior of the bad guys is defeated by an average female warrior it could do with some more drama it is evident from all 3 movies together that its a story about the eternal fight between good and bad but in these movies its never really explained why exactly the bad guys hate the good guys whats even more disturbing is the facial features of the bad vs the groomed faces of the good guys as if the storyline itself simply wasnt strong enough to outline that they are really evil the orcs have disfigured faces disfigured teeth drool and have a hissing voice couldnt jackon portray that a little bit more subtile frodo is attacked by a giant spider who has surprise surprise also a deformed face and only one eye on the left side of the head is this done to make sure 3 year old infants cannot mistake who is the scary bad guy it was ridiculous to see in fact i had trouble hating them at all i just felt sorry for them i understand its a family movie but this blatant deforming is an insult to the intelligence of people then theres the plot and the story it doesnt make any sense theres no explanation why faramir father wants to kill himself and his son or why gandalf or aragorn do not take the ring to mordor but trust it to little frodo who does nothing but squeel cry and hug sam in between why did the fellowship decide to break up and let frodo continue alone with sam while the other stronger fellows try to save peppin and merrin on with this movie gandalf and aragorn guess frodo must be close to his end goal in mordor but is held up by saurons watching eye so decide to launch a distracting attack with the last army the good guys have left what if frodo happened to appear a few hours later or a few days and sauron itself was a huge warrior in movie 1 but now only a flame on a tower why do the thousands of orcs stop fighting when the tower crumble they flee but where to it is just too unbelievable stupid in movie one thousands of orc chase the fellowship in moria only inches away but none of them harm frodo or manage to catch them in movie 2 they ride with 5 horses through 10000 orcs without so much as a scratch in movie 3 gandalf fights the orcs in mordor but suddenly stops for a moment of musing and while the fighting around him continues not an orc touches him or buries his sword in gandalfs white hair ive seen c class horrors that made more sense then theres the last 20 minutes frodo destroyed the ring but the end simply goes on and on and on and on lots of tear jerking twists appear and you simply start shouting please end to the tv screen in utter annoyance no this movie may have won all academy awards it was nominated for but it was a terrible terrible series the thing that saved this last part a little bit was the helicopter view scenery but if i wanna watch helicopter view scenery ill watch national geographic even the epic battles gave me a feeling of been there done that star wars gladiator ben hur they all done the same and most of the time better shot directed edited and more importantly more believable and the directing was awful the cinematography boring and predictable the editing confusing the  predictable the storyline infantile the acting without any exception terrible the lenght insane the events too much for fantasy the cgi effects hokey it is a childs movie a la jungle book it belongs on nickelodeon between spongebob and johnny bravo in fact there oughta be a law against peter jackson movies i said borefest in the summary but that was too kind its a nice series when you are a child but its outright trash if youre an adult the one aspect that made this one better than the other 2 movies is that there is finally and end to the endless walking and talking the ring is destroyed peter jacksons mega project too thankfullynegative, as a 13 year old just getting into cinema this was the best film ever how could i not be blown away by all the clever dialog great characters fantastic storyline and gripping violence it was just pure heaven i saw this movie three times in the course of one year and i still have such fond memories of watching it it was around the time i got serious about cinema about two years later that i felt i needed to give this another go id discovered the works of bergman tarkovsky godardetc and felt a connection with film in ways i hadnt before and i wanted to see if the movies i loved before still held up i had every intention of loving pulp fiction just as much as i did back then but i didnt there was nothing there no core all the things id loved about it were gone that clever dialog referential nonsense that gave no insight into who i was watching or attempted to expand the narrative the great characters indistinctive cardboard cutouts that act as mouthpieces for tarintino fantastic storyline a pseudo throwback to film noir that cant decide whether it wants to take itself seriously or be intentionally stupid for the sake of irony gripping violence its violence thats harsh enough to put the average viewer in awe safe enough as to not offend its a dead film with no ideas a common argument i hear in its favor is that its somehow objectively entertaining why because it has guys with guns and monologues about mcdonalds sorry but thats not entertainment in my mind entertainment is being engaged having to think a film like andrei rublev is entertaining because while i watch it it evokes thought and feeling it has something i can sink my teeth into i can still think about it interpret it in different ways pulp fiction is just shutting your brain off for two and half hours while a man with a god complex strokes his ego basically i can understand to some extent why it is so popular its very good at pleasing the masses something tarkovsky could never do its so perfectly designed to hook the average viewer in but its paper thin this is exactly what i dont want in cinema negative, not the strongest of the trilogy a lengthy drawn out conclusion it lacks the heart of the previous two and lapses on awkwardly with trivial and extraneous characters while he focus obviously should have been elsewhere i especially despised that tacky girlpower bit just goes to show directors actually can drag out irrelevant tacked on plot pieces and the ignorant hordes call it epic because hey its really longyou can pee 3 times get popcorn and soda refillsanswer your pagerand not miss anything most of the dialog is redundant expectancies of the end its got to end right however tediously and it is tedious with proper editing this movie could have been condensed into an hour butguess what the whole trilogys been padded so extensively for length so you can pay to see 3 not just 2 filmsits most obvious in this one wow this passes for classic negative, many critics cite the 1952 film the greatest show of earth as the poorest best picture selection in academy history that dubious distinction should now go to lord of the rings the return of the king which makes demilles circus epic seem like the greatest show on earth in comparison it was not only the academy but also the once relevant new york film critics circle that chose this film as the years best its a wonder that the ghost of pauline kael didnt use her after life influence with the all mighty to strike the entire group dead this video game like film goes from one chase scene to the next with little in the way of plot development ive seen all three films and dont have a clue what the fellowship of the ring is or the significance of the two towers nor where the king was returning from director jackson failed to include much in the way of plot exposition in nine plus hours of film the computer generated gollum was the most interesting character in the film at least he wanted to kill off those annoying hobbits ian mckellen is distinguished in his knightly role and added a touch of class to the otherwise endless stream of special effects the female stars of the film tyler and blanchett have so little screen time that it doesnt make sense to even have them in the film apparently tylers character is present merely to suggest that mortensens character is heterosexual why blanchett has such an annoying smile on her face each fifteen seconds she is on screen is a mystery to menegative,no1 movie of all time i think thats what ruined it for me i sat down expecting to watch the most spectacular cinematic experience of my life but instead i ended up sitting rather bored for the good part of 3hours everything about it just lacked in moving me the vengeance was untouched parts of the story seemed to obvious and other parts just left untouched thoroughly this was the most disappointing film ive ever seen not the worst just the most disappointing im not trying to change anyones thoughts on the film or make out the film is bad just in case anyone gets the impression thanksnegative,for years my boyfriend has been insisting that i watch this film finally i did big mistake my issues with this film are multiple the pacing of the film is just terrible its soooooooo slow and yet at the same time rushes through many things leaving many questions unanswered character development is beyond terrible especially when it comes to michael who goes from nice guy who is nothing like his family to sociopath with no shades of grey in between the relationships are also poor one minute michael is in love with kay the next minute hes in sicily and in what feels like 5 minutes married to apollonia then about 5 minutes later shes dead and hes home and married to kay before apollonia corpse is even cold smaller issues include the fact that michael seems to have a black eye for approximately a year either that or he spent about a week abroad in which time he managed to get married also would have been nice to know what happened to connie after getting beaten up by her husband clearly she must have phoned sonny i assume did she lose the child or is that the child that michael was godfather to if so where did michaels 4 year old son come from i guess i was asleep when that was explained or maybe id just lost the will to live all in all i found the film slow boring and rife withe cardboard cut out characters my tip avoid especially if you watch with someone who loves the filmnegative,i do not understand the hype this movie was nothing but a waste of my time why first i believe a movie should have a clearly outlined plot so that you know whats going on this movie doesnt feature that it starts out of nowhere with no apparent background and has a pointless ending there are indeed a couple of scenes that might be fun to watch if you are in the right mind however most are violent and immature and the actors do an excellent performance but that doesnt pump this movie up to anything good it kind of shows you the happenings of a few drugdealers and criminals within a short timeframe thats all to sum it up this movie has few redeeming qualities do something productive and more fun instead such as washing the dishes two stars out of ten negative,the whole trilogy achieves to translate admirably well the deep boringness of the book replacing infinite descriptions with long empty tired repetitious and over emotional sequences totally misplaced considering the britney spears like deepness of characters characters are so flat and numerous that you waste half of the movie trying to remember who is who but it doesnt really matter anyway actions sometimes come to wake you up they are mostly entertaining but the most decisive and very awaited one is reduced to a game like greenish flow that is the only thing that happens to be fast in the whole movie be happy the end is near should be rated 5 to 7negative,well i finally saw pulp fiction hadnt after all this time but ive heard so much ta doo over it so i rented it ugh i guess i must not be film critic material because i didnt appreciate the art of this film or its brilliance or any statement it might have made it was unpleasant filled with scumbag people i cared nothing about doing godawful things to each other with horrendously graphic visuals and appalling dialogue it jumped around in time circling back to where it opened but from another viewpoint and while that may be some sort of artsy crafting in editing or storytelling it doesnt save it from the fact that it was just plain revolting when the characters could get away for a second from m f ing all over the place there was some interesting verbal exchange bright and witty and even vaguely profound but kafka it aint i have to say i thought all the performances were incredible esp samuel jackson but cant quentin tarantino stay out of any of his own films even playing a nicer guy he comes off as a borderline psycho i thought it was very interesting tho to see chicago hopes eric stoltz in there as a drug dealer i worry about peoples minds if this is what they think of as a great movie eek a movie about redemption gee i didnt see any of that if perhaps a character got out of the violent melee alive id hardly call that redemption if they are hardly anyone worth caring about being redeemed in the first place an earthquake fault could have opened up and swallowed the lot of em and i would have applauded people think its really cool or trendy to give accolades to trash nowadays time to get some mouthwash for my eyes and get the stench out of emnegative,the movie was based on a very bad book with a horrible language and style its no secret that the movie is better than the book but it doesnt make it good the story that turns violent ruthless criminals into men of honor and the horrible world of crime into something beautiful and almost royal its unnecessarily violent and why did brando put paper towel in his mouth i mean i like him as an actor but this character is absolutely ridiculous i dont understand how anyone could give an oscar for that film its just stupidnegative,this movie is one of the few that i nearly walked out on it was so bad it was too disjointed and i could not understand the point or plot people were killed in one scene and then popped up in another lots of gratuitous violence and brutality that did not seem to have much to do with the plotnegative,this movie is awful the ending was longer than any battle scene the entire final battle was completely meaningless the humans might as well have stood there because the only ones that did any fighting were the ghosts very anti climatic and the ending was about 35 minutes too long even the most hardcore of fans has to agree on those two points the only good part about this movie was the final battle it seemed and then the ghosts came and completely dominated everything therefore making the previous half hour meaningless i want my 3 hours of my life back and also my ten bucks in all the action was meaningless and the movie would have been much better had it been about 2 hours long topsnegative,shawshank is by far the most grossly overrated films of all time to say that this is better than lawrence of arabia better than alien better then saving private ryan is just ridiculous this movie is weak as are all the characters in it ill never forgot the scene where the old man hangs himself after leaving prison and the piano symphony kicks in why should i feel sorry for him try living in africa buddy and tell me how hard your life is this movie is for weak people who love to shed a tear for prisoners and overall just weak people now i love the director of this and stephen king but im sorry this isnt a masterpiece its forcing the audience into the characters emotional problems that few can relate go see the green mile instead rating = d videogamehollywoodcomnegative, you want to do something really neat take the movie pulp fiction and re cut it so that instead of being out of sequence it is actually in proper sequence it can be done why do this because if you do you will see what a nothing movie this really is there is no central plot there is no real theme or story or climax it is just a bunch of tricks and overly snappy dialog masquerading a piece of fluff that has as much depth as the kiddie pool hey more power to tarantino the guy is a houdini full of slight of hand but are we really so simple that we are ranking this one of the ten greatest movies ever made come on ok i know that travolta is cool and jackson is funny however lets reserve the greatest films of all time category for real masterpieces and real stories and not some overly slick pulp geared towards video store geeks negative, i really cant believe that such good actors like john travolta samuel jackson bruce willis tim roth and ving rhames have accepted to play this non sense movie and i also cant believe that quentin tarantino has created such no head and no feet filmwhen i saw it i got very disappointed because before watching it i had seen reservoir dogs and jackie brown two extraordinary films so i thought that i was going to find a similar film herebut unfortunately i did not negative, i rent the film because the fact that its #9 on imdb 250 list and my friend highly recommend the film so i watched it last night i couldnt believe my eye what a piece of garbage film making this is the whole film is mostly consist of boring & cheesy dialaue in which have at least a million f word in it the character sucked i never felt i care about them and the worst thing is that theres not motherfreaking plot i watched the whole film and did not understand what the hell is going on i cannot think of any positive things about this film and why is this film loved by many and get thumb up from the critics heres some of my theory 1 this is a very unique film for its time so people get on a bandwagon and start praise this film so whoever hate this film would considered uncool 2 pulp fiction is so bad that its good as mention before pulp fiction is a unique film its so unique that its hard to tell that its good or bad but the critics decided to call it good soon a bandwagon start the bottom line is do not watch this film dont care about what other people say if this comment doesnt convince you to stay away from this film then go to page 5678 there are other people who just hate this film as much as i do negative, the movie that defines the sensibilities of generation x that is to say its values are worthless the story is lurid and over extended the writer director is overwhelmingly self indulgent and tacky any revelations to do with christianity are twisted by tarantino to fit his obscene sense of morality the violence is absolutely incredulous and the originality to do with non linear plot lines and everything else is greatly exaggerated try watching some early kubrick to get an idea where he ripped it off hell try watching 50 other trashy independent exploitation flicks from the 50s and 60s to see how much originality tarantino has im not going to make any friends here as this film has obviously snowed everyone whos commented on it but who cares despite some extremely intelligent and powerhouse acting from samuel l jackson pulp fiction is a n experience not unlike having your face smashed into a urinal by a criminally insane biker in the bathroom at a race track between race four and five it is an offensive and disturbing trip through the mind of a filmmaker who is as far from being a genius as the earth is from neptune quentin tarantino is not orson welles and pulp fiction is a film which only speaks to a generation pre occupied with body piercing and anti depressants make no mistake i am more of an atheist than a christian but even i am outraged that people find deep meaning in a killer seeing the light and turning over a new leaf by letting the piece of garbage petty crook snake out the door with everyones wallet he has terrorized at gunpoint along with his wigged out nutcase of a girlfriend youd just wish tony minero would ice if he truly was making a spiritual point and sincerely trying to do the right thing hed have given tim roth his wallet told him to leave the bag and apologize to everyone on his way out off to a flawed start as a christian and the fact that tarantino lets us see that roth and plummers characters arent terrible people but just actors before they pull their heist is also a load of crap then theres the completely sickening la underworld psycho scene a personal tarantino fantasy to do with sodomy and a couple of hillbillies which was done much truer and to better effect in boormans deliverance does anyone truly come away finding this scene to be entertaining and if so if youre ever in my town please keep driving quentin tarantino is truly one sick puppy sure he does write some nifty dialogue if you can hear it amid the cacophony of mf and n words but as far as talent for film making goes he hasnt got an idea he couldnt act his way out of a box made of wet tissue paper spielberg gave a better performance in the blues brothers and visually he has nothing to offer at all if anyone knows his influences and he speaks of them often you will know how all of the people he holds dear and in high regard especially howard hawks would phone the swat team on him rather than invite him to sit at their table and to sum up my point what can you expect from a guy who prattles on and on and on about how great a film rio bravo is before any more gen x and yers announce to the world that this is the greatest film ever made please see some other movies beforehand start with citizen kane negative, bad acting ok story for the fans but i dont fancy this rpg trend crap i dont know how this movie ever entered the top250 movies of imdb should be ranked #500 best movie of all time or less my real grade for this movie is 60 but i voted it a 10 because lots of mindless people voted it a 10 and no way this boring movie is a 10 special effects dont make a movie a 10 out of 10 go watch the other movies on top10 list like godfather and shawshank redemption and then try to compare it with this piece of negative,childish romantic view of common criminals in no way equal to goodfellas which really captures the truth about the underworld the director must have been fantasizing about some imaginary sicilian aristocracy drinking too much vino or simply mining a vein he knew would be commercially successful there are excellent performances by brando pacino and caan among others but the operatic excesses of the film make a mockery of reality the individual performances are wasted not unlike apocalypse now  the godfather is an arrogant film with little genuine substance and undermines an accurate understanding of the subject matter it substitutes a yarn for a true story and while it is entertaining it contributes to the deterioration of our culture like the gladiator it grabs your attention then tells you lies the godfather is the cinematic equivalent of baroque architecture excessive gaudy and not worth the work to create negative, i think it is the worst film ive seen in a long time and ive seen the original star warsthe characters are so annoying and i wished they all died at the end of the film i wised orlando blooms character legalos would be shot in the face with an arrow by lurtz also i think aragon should get a hair cut and have a shave because ll you see is hair also what is up with that little guy gimli he is so annoying he makes little jokes which are not even funny during a supposedly serious film the group always overact about everything what is the point of leglos saying blood has been spilt this night and walking right up to the camera this look very mincy how did it win best film award how did it win any awardalso the other two films were just as bad they could have cut the films lengths by half if they did not put in so much pointless chatter it would also help if they had real actors and did not rely on cgi so much negative, okay so they built a good villain in the joker but the plot was just a bit too unbelievable to hold together im not going to add any spoilers here but if you want a big budget action adventure escape that totally relies on the rendering farms that had to handle all the special effects and dont mind plot holes the hindenburg could fly through this film is for you imho this film doesnt deserve all the hype look at reviews from people who hated it and see why once the hype has died down and people get over their brainwash to overrate this over produced hollywood crap we should see ratings more in line with the films true value i didnt walk out but that was because i had such high expectations id hope to see this rated a 4 maybe even as high as a 6 by the average public im rating this a 1 to try to offset the obvious shills and excessive hype this is by no means the best film of the summer but in its favor it does give better balance to the darkness of batman if it werent for the growing trend in bucking the old feel good hollywood ending routine if it werent becoming clich‹© to kill off good guys and create characters with seeming hearts of gold who turn half evil id say this film had something unique but that whole scenario is now a formula for making a film armchair critics will say has depth pffff save your time and money and rent an old classic favorite that you somehow never managed to see or go have a picnic with your loved ones the alternative is two and a half hours you wont get back dont waste it to further enrich warner brosnegative, a touch of reality is much needed for those who of late have occupied themselves in tossing about bon mots like masterpiece and crime epic perhaps never before have the expectations of rabid fanboys so completely bullied the critics into sheer lying for lying it must be since i refuse to believe that the critics did not see through this it is just not possible i feel that most of them simply cowed down before the staggering pre release fanboy blitzkrieg rather than provoke the inevitable backlash of acrimony from fans and thereby needlessly risk their careers this is the only explanation i can conceive of as to why tdk has seemingly d so well with the critics i dont blame the critics though the blame lies in the fanboys hysteria their myopic refusal to see the obvious i feel that chris nolan tried really really hard to make a good film but ultimately even he with all his skill cant do much simply because of the limitations of the genre if viewers truly want more realism as they say they do then why turn to comics in the first place its just amazing how comic book junkies pull the wool over their own eyes and deceive themselves into thinking that what they read is deep and sophisticated when in fact and there cannot be two opinions on this reading comics beyond a certain age is a sign of neurotic behaviour and before you shove it in my face that it is me who is taking it too seriously let me just say that this movie was nothing but lashes of violence grim sadistic violence once again the so called realism is simply a pretext for the usual action movie gang banging ie violence and special effects and its not even just because of the genre batman begins rose above those limitations right one could empathize with the young bruce wayne tormented by his perceived culpability in his parents murder and struggling with his anger and loneliness not so in tdk here there is neither plot nor motivation to speak of and not a single character with whom one can even remotely identify the acting apart from one notable performance is mediocre to be fair the film does take certain risks which i cant imagine the likes of say a sam raimi ever taking it isnt a mcdonaldized blockbuster to the degree that the spiderman films and the rest of the comic book parade are the problem is that those risks dont pay off instead of an even progression of events that build up to a crescendo what you get here is one absurdity after another until you are numb and it no longer matters who is doing what i wonder if it is really so hard to tell the truth even only to oneself apparently it is indeed so difficult for all the fanboys to own up that the countless hours spent over the last several months sitting up nights staring at their monitors and devouring every last bit of inconsequential trivia about tdk have all amounted to a huge nothing tdk is the prime example of how the advertising business works today hyping up a product during pre release to uncalled for heights and ultimately forcing the gullible consumer to like the product against his better judgement the marketing behind this film is very much the phenomenal success story of this decade and should serve as a de facto case study for anyone who wants to understand just exactly how mob psychology works edit a more appropriate rating for this film is 4 10 but i so deeply despise warner bros & the people lauding this film ie everyone except me that i must give it 1 10 just to balance thingsnegative,wellfirst of all the whole story and plot got nothing to do with the original comic book story which already makes it even more unauthentic and unwatchable then it already is the joker basically had some help killing the mobsters of gotham city along with other freaks batmans foes like him like two face poison ivy etc second the movie changed the whole atmosphere and story into a shallow script with too much special effects and cgi not mentioning big stunts and the same predictable and uninspired below mediocre kind of plot common to most action movies and comic based movies these days and besides the acting and direction were just bad and some characters seemed not convincing and stupid not mentioning the way the writers changed some important key characters like the joker heath ledger was just weirdhe didnt fit to the jokers role in conclusion a complete waste of time including your brain cells an endless and unwatchable crapfest an overrated and over hyped lame knight who is not a gentleman nor a good movie or a good comic book adaptionnegative, shawshank redemption has been elevated in popular opinion to the status of masterpiece because of one irrefutable virtue it is accessible regrettably as is true in so many cases popular opinion is an inaccurate gauge of this pictures actual quality the reason this film has attained its current level of acclaim is that it is impossible to misinterpret its theme or message impossible to be offended by it impossible to be confused by however as this review should show it is entirely possible to be unimpressed by shawshank the story of shawshank redemption is something i might expect if i was being pitched a script by middle schoolers the complex coincidental frameup the daring escape the clear cut definitions of good and evil the timeless friendship finally and uneventfully consummated on a beautiful shoreline each step more unsurprising than the last each beat more clich‹©d that the last every time the filmmakers feel like building tension or revealing something about the characters they take the most obvious road this might be excusable if the road didnt also lead to the most obvious destinations people also praise the acting in the film while it isnt at all bad its hard to be impressed when the actors are playing such simplistic roles stereotypes when acted well are still boring i sincerely hope that over time when the film has settled into history and once people are more able to set this pandering film along side its heavily plundered predecessors it will become clear that it offers nothing new and that what it does offer it doesnt even offer all that well negative, the shawshank redemption is a movie about a hotshot banker named andy dufresnetim robbins who is convicted of murdering his wife and is imprisoned in shawshank prison he remains hopeful and makes friends especially with a blackmarketeer named red morgan freeman i really dont see how this movie could possibly be the #2 film of all time the movie is nothing groundbreakingly amazing it is pretty poorly directed the plot is thinner than airthere are no risks takenand there is no thought provoked through watching the film that it only needs to one viewing to get the whole movie in fact you wouldnt even need to watch the film to even understand how the movie is going end the title already gives away the whole big finale of the movie i dont see how anyone could possibly compare this to actually great movies like everything that is below is on the top 25 and the simple thought of this winning best picture back in 94 hahahahahahaha it would have given me somethingh to laugh at for the rest of my life i still cant possibly see how the academy could have even nominated this as the best picture of 1994 anyway the only thing that saves the film of morgan freeman and it is only thing that even got me to see this film in the first place but it still cant stop me from giving this a poor grade 2 10 negative, saying this is the #2 movie of all time is like saying mcdonalds makes the best hamburgers theyre both palatable predictable inoffensive products that are easy to digest both have happy endings that is if you find the stunning speed with which a mcdonalds hamburger flushes out your digestive tract to be a happy occasion all you need to know is that shawshank has the exact same ending as trading places so why not make trading places the greatest comedy of all time what the hell why not make it #3 on imdb it too is competent and utterly middle of the road in terms of quality and originality within its genre instead of dan ackroyd and eddie murphy laughing it up on a caribbean beach after besting the forces of evil we get morgan freeman and tim robbins its the exact same ending shawshank was ok when i saw it when it came out but count me among the backlash group that would rather see it with the 6 7 rating that it deserves thusly i hereby cast my symbolic 1 star vote negative,awful a dreadful disgrace the film is the most cliched in cinematic history and is worthy of no respect even worse is how it is so flawless yet it still is of no quality i do not know how this film can be revered over others such as psycho apocalypse now raging bull easy rider the godfather the killing fields some like it hot and casablanca amongst others shockingly horrendousnegative,yes joker was really great but overall this movie was a total letdown a few totally stupid things that killed this movie for me spoilers joker blows up a freaking hospital in broad freaking daylight and makes his escape in an ultra fast school bus which no cop seems able to stop even though theyve been warned that joker will you know blow up a hospital you see this is totally believable because the cops apparently set up a perimeter two freaking miles away just to be safe its not like they could have used a helicopter or something for surveillance that would just make too much sense sarcasm batman falls several stories to the ground not once but twice and gets up without so much as a broken bone but hey thats okay because his super duper special armor which is so strong that a dog can chew through it protected him from the fall thats totally realistic right whats that you say the metal roof of the taxi totally cushioned his fall well thats even better how wonderfully realistic if i ever have to jump out of a burning building its nice to know that a kevlar vest and a strategically placed car will break my fall police commissioner gordon pretends to be dead so that joker will chase after harvey dent instead of his family huh and joker proceeds to kill six innocent people in the middle of downtown chicago uh gotham city but this is okay because by drawing the joker out the police are protecting the public from harm no reason to clear the streets of pedestrians and traffic and stuff while transporting harvey dent as bait for a sicko maniac killer joker manages to keep a pencil perfectly balanced on a table while a large gangster stomps across the floor to fight him cool but stupid joker burns a pyramid of money because you see money is not important to him whats important to him is blowing and burning stuff up which is exactly why he robs banks for a living makes perfect sense no batman speaks with an annoying rasp which hides his bruce wayne voice because as everyone knows christopher nolan wants this to be a realistic depiction of batman which is why we have sonar cell phones in this movie and magic armor and explosive laced bat mobiles that turn into motorcycles which do gravity defying 360 turns on walls other complaints there was no wayne manor in this film no bat cave chicago looks a bit too bright and modern to be gotham city seriously what is gotham city without you know gothic architecture the girl playing rachel dawes is completely ugly but for some reason bruce wayne is so obsessed with her that he decides to have sex with the whole gotham city ballet just so she cant go on a date with harvey dent i know lots of people got drawn into the hype of seeing heath ledgers last great performance but besides joker there is no redeeming value in this film theres no iconic battles no real hero to root for seriously you will hate batman in this movie christopher nolan gets a special mention for trying to inject at least some intelligence into a summer blockbuster but there was just one too many stupid things to justify the price of admission if you havent seen this film just wait for it on dvdnegative,i was expecting to see at least a semi good movie but this film is not even up to par this film gets a 1 rating from me because it tries to depict batman and fails miserably at it even for an action movie if batman hadnt been in it its not good the plot is horrid and morbid the amount of gore unhealthy and the fight sequences are badly done notable problems a what is this rock theme music thats constant in the movie it comes whenever a suspense scene starts and sounds like an annoying electric guitar what is this doing in a batman film also the plot seems to be totally disconnected in between scenes the entire movie is like one big mishmash of 10 different stories that occur in succession it is also unrealistic many times in the beginning the joker simply takes his schoolbus into the convoy to escape and the way he avoids police in broad daylight and blows up the hospital is unbelievable b the joker in this film is someone with a predilection for violence and violence alone traditionally the joker has been a nefarious insane character he does things that are out of kilter with normalcy he then laughs at what he does and takes unexpected delight in it this joker is not like so hes simply a disturbed psychopath who likes to blow up things and harm others theres no depth to the character c harvey dent has been traditionally black the last 2 decades that and the way hes made into two face in this movie is totally wrong two face traditionally goes on to become a crime boss but in this movie he simply dies soon after coming into being he also isnt a good two face overusing his coin flip to make decisions for example in the limousine scene he flips the coin again and kills the driver in order to eliminate a crime boss the real two face wouldnt have cheated like this once the coin makes a decision for him d batman himself doesnt appear much in the movie we are shown glimpses of him and the fight scenes are very darkly lit so its hard to see who and how hes fighting his over reliance on technology is also not good because batman usually uses wits as well as brawn the voice of batman is guttural sounding and bruce wayne himself doesnt seem to have any emotions micheal keatons portrayal of batman in batman made in 1989 is by far the best in all movies the dark knight is not just not a good batman film its a poor film in any genre i recommend watching batman 1989 if one wants to see an excellent batman film heres a small sample from this great movie thats better than the entire the dark knight http wwwyoutubecom watchv=sc249jpbbdynegative,what an over rated pile of toss oooooooooooh look at the effects oooooooh gollum is so real ooooooooooh id love to have long blond hair and pointy ears shut up you fools why cant people just watch excellent films and appreciate them instead of being tossed around by the wild current of sensationalism and hype all three of the films were at best average adaptations of the book but just because this is the last one it gets the highest rating its a travesty that rubbish like this overtakes actual classic films on an otherwise excellent database and dont get me started on star wars this is fantastic nonsense over produced and under thought bad taste is a far superior film stick with schlock horror jacksonand learn how to tie a tienegative,now before i start i must first say i am no huge fan of the batman films and i have never seen batman begins however after going to the cinemas to watch this film i was surprised how good it is i mean the joker did the best acting there was and he was kind of funny however im afraid that was the only guy that did amazing christian bale did very good and im looking forward to his next film terminator 4 salvation however i thought his deep voice in tdn was a little badwhy did it have to be so bad of a voice anyway forget the voice its a good film but for the time it lasts 2 30 hours it could of been shorter and just as good but yeah 7 10 i recommend this film to anyone however it isnt one of my favourites why so serious negative,i cant tell you how disappointed i am in the dark knight my friends and i waited for months to see this and it was a film i was expecting to see numerous times having viewed it i wouldnt watch it again unless someone paid me a lot of money im a science fiction fan so i on board with artistic allowance as long as its consistent with the framework of the film there were several violations in this movie that i dont understand how people fans can get past ill site a few examples that i feel cheapened the movie beyond repair 1right out of the gate in the opening scene since when can batman bend a steel gun barrel with his hands 2bruce wayne is now smart enough to network all the phones in gotham city and stick the results into a database last time i checked my phone didnt have sonar technology the phone that morgan freeman brought to hong kong was described to have special capabilities yet suddenly bruce wayne is able to extend that capability to all 30m citizens phones in the city the most idiotic part was when mogran freeman was analyzing the output and suddenly the jokers face appeared on the screen immediately in front of him did the joker stop by at&t before that scene to upgrade his phone there were about 500 mini screens in front of moran freeman and he just so happened to be looking at the one where the jokers face appeared i wanted to leave the theater at this point 3 if you are admitted to the hospital with burns on half your body and your clothes are saturated from lying on a floor with gasoline the hospital will remove and dispose of your clothes when you are admitted yet when the joker freed two face two face suddenly had his half burned clothes back on for the remainder of the movie 4who planted all the explosive charges in the hospital for the joker there seemed to be hundreds of devices that were suddenly in place and conveniently no hospital staff noticed oh and how convenient that the joker had a friend or a bomb in the right place at the right time whenever he was in a bad position something like this is okay in couple occasions in the movie but not in every scene 5what was the point in having the lamborghini in the movie just to be destroyed cheap thrill ledgers direct performance was great i just wish they had built a simpler more believable movie around him i wanted this movie to be great as much as anyone here i expect a certain level of consistency and believability from the movies i watch again believable within the framework of the movie as much as i wanted tdk to be a great movie i couldnt even will this movie to the level of awfulnegative, i cant see what people see in this movie i did not like it because it is violent for violences sake and unless you think that is funny it is not interesting another movie from quentin tarantino that is just crude pulp says it all the writing is clever i wont deny that the cast is good what a waste of talent to put a movie like this on a pedestal is a sad commentary on our times it is hard to identify most of the characters unless you are a criminal type it seams in order to make a great movie all you have to do is put as much violence sex and the f word as you can and people will laud you there is no redeeming value in this movie negative,this movie was not enough for even one star it had had too much of a plot twist and the acting was awful the only good thing about it was the fact that it had guns a blazing and john travolta in it if its one movie you want to watch in a movie store skip over this hunk a junknegative,i dont know what the academy was thinking when it gave the return of the king those 11 awards it did not deserve a single one especially best picture lost in translation mystic river cold mountain and even seabiscuit were all far better those films actually had depth and meaning where as the lord of the rings is just like titanic a bunch of shotty acting and film making covered up with tons of high budget special effects neither film deserved their awards and both in my view are among the most overrated and crappiest films in history i wish the academy would stop choosing the films that are the most popular or will give them the greatest approval ratingnegative,this is a fantastic movie that truly defines classic cinema how do i even begin to describe the skill with which this movie is made the viewer is taken to a setting of violence in deception set within the scope of 1950s new york city in the beginning of the movie the viewer mistakenly believes they grasp the concept of what it means to hold a position in the mafia but this concept is quickly replaced with an almost uncomfortable sense of familiarity the story is told through the legendary actors portraying some of the most complex and meaningful characters of all time however i gave this movie one starbecause it didnt have to logannegative,this is pure sht movie without normal plot and characters only part which is funny is when samuel l jackson interrogates that dude in the apartment bruce willis has no part in this moviehe just sit around and rages about some watch which his father carried in the a during world war not to mention that stupid gay partno comment on that it was suppose to be a bad a ss movie and it was just pure sh it quentin tarantino go direct and produce some third class chinese shiy movies this was suppose to be in a bottom 250 movies not in top 10 people are so stupid and like shiy movies john travolta just dance in this movie and shot a guy in the face but nobody gave a fuk because its so stupid movienegative, batman the dark knight is a tacky trashy mindless ultra violent piece of garbage it will bore anyone with a mature mind the dark knight consists of one sadistic pointlessly violent scene after another there is no point to these scenes except to extract money from the pockets of teenage boys who have had no experience of real life the dark knight is a drug it pushes violence and sadism thats it thats what you get for your ten bucks the dark knight is a sick product of a sick system whats the difference between a blockbuster death fest like this and an act of actual terrorism how many deaths do films like this contribute to how much suffering pointless ugly violent sadistic movies peddle violence as the drug of choice to mindless consumer hoards who lack discrimination life experience wisdom or balance teenage boys who spend all their time playing video games and having no experience of three dimensional reality see a movie like this and conclude that the world is like this cool criminals torture passive victims and meet no resistance hey thanks hollywood for flushing your refuse into young male minds ka ching how much more violent and sadistic will such films have to be in the future to make that cash register sing lets up the ante the plot heath ledger puts on a ridiculous series of ticks costumes and make up and tries really hard to get taken seriously as a master criminal master actor there is no real performance there because there is no real life there in one scene ledger a slight young man murders a very large muscular professional criminal and a black man ‰ÛÒ white supremacists will like that part ‰ÛÒ with a pencil no in real life that would not happen nor in real life would a man who shoots his every accomplice be able to do pull off any of the stunts ledger does in this film the movie is utterly implausible this wont matter to its fans who talk only to other fans who worship films like this as they do in their solipsistic computer generated echo chamber the dark knight is the greatest film ever made these fans have little contact with anyone not exactly like themselves and cant see any flaws in their judgment though saturated in violence these fans cant even see why a skinny guy like ledger murdering a muscular hardened criminal with a pencil is a silly nasty scene that exists only to up the sadism ante not to have any relationship with reality though saturated in violence these fans would panic at the merest contact with the real world with the real violence occurring in places like iraq or federal prisons christian bale is an interesting actor and was fun to watch in the previous batman hes hardly on screen here there is nothing interesting about the sets or costumes and as for the special effects how many chase scenes and big explosions have been on screen recently nothing new nothing interesting the intelligent viewer will move along or simply select a better film negative,the godfather 3 oscars nonononononononono this film and its others is the worst piece of rubbish i have ever endured i feel that it was an insult to my backside who was forced to grow carbuncles under the weight of such mafia slush the acting is terrible the premise is horrible and the time is awful they made more than 1 yes were any of them good and im not biased i always watch things till the end to get a full view i even watched the others although i hated it no all awful all too long need i say more my view 10 10negative, let me tell you first and foremost that i have viewed plenty mafia movies not to mention i own several as well the first thing i have to say about the godfather that the entire plot is boring and drab its almost as the director is trying to make americans fall in love with criminalsnot to mention a bad display of italian americans were depicted in this film almost as insulting as goodfellas the question we must ask ourselves is are italians really that thick headed and vulgar and the answer is a resounding no you almost get the impression that vito corleone is a homosexual and that james canns character has a mental diffieciency the only good character depicted in the movie was al pacinos part a man who wrestles with his own personal demons family loyalty and the straight and narrow life i wouldnt recommend this movie to anyone and how it made number one is beyond methe only emotion it evoked in me was anger although it helped me to fall asleep which i thank francis for negative,the following writing which you are about to read has little bits of things in it that might spoil the movie if you havent seen it which i would not recommend so please do not read this or see the movie this movie sucks this is one of those rubbish old mafia films from 30 years ago back when they still didnt know how to make them properly with lots of killings and foul language its just rubbish if i wanted to watch fat old men sitting around a table and talking for three hours id go to some place where they do that and watch them instead it doesnt even have any plots to it everybody just speaks in a strange language like im supposed to understand that this one guy in the movie is the worst heaving windbag ive ever seen in my life he even kills himself with oranges which is so stupid because oranges arent even poisonous please do not watch this film it is too rubbish for words although i have used words in what i have just said watch a proper mafia film like goodfellas or corky romano insteadnegative, this movie is incredibly overrated on imdb top five film of all time what are people thinking half the movie was action & chase scenes if you agree please register and vote this out of the top 10 i agree it was an entertaining film but is it one film students will be watching in 5 years is it one youd watch 10 times i mean it currently outranks pulp fiction empire strikes back goodfellas etc it should be at least 100 rankings below where it is now when i look at the top 50 this movie sticks out like a sore thumb as not belonging yes ledger gave a stellar performance maybe even oscar worthy but a top 5 movie ever performance negative, warning possible spoilers here this movie is a monumental disappointment i had seen all five of the previous batman movies on the big screen and i watched as they kept getting worse and worse and worse i hoped that this one would break the trend and with all the raves surrounding heath ledgers great performance i really thought it would but it did not this movie is so trite and so absurd and what is most reprehensible is that it suggests that there is no good vs evil anymore‰ÛÓas a matter of fact the movie closes with batman himself being chased by the gotham police and constantly throughout the movie batman now suddenly called the batman is seen as being the reason behind all the murders robberies and destruction the joker is perpetrating in gotham city by the way gotham city here does not at all look like the gotham city that we know it is chicago pretending to be gotham city which is very boring what happened to the stunning production design that gotham city is supposed to have as for heath ledger he makes a great impact in one of his first scenes in the movie when his sudden killing of a gang member serves as the punch line to a joke but after that scene the jokers energy totally dwindles away and he becomes another smart aleck philosophical killer‰Û_and even downright boring in an attempt to keep things entertaining with the joker the movie resorts to dressing him in a nurses outfit a cheap laugh to make a quick comparison the dark knight is very much like live free or die hard and a million other movies in that everything is on the verge of complete destruction and chaos at the hands of a villain and like die hard 4 when are needless sequels going to stop it tries to replicate the feel of 9 11‰ÛÓa real life tragedy that should not be incorporated into comic book stories like batman batman himself makes a pathetic showing in this film as he is much clumsier and more ineffective against the villains than ever before but then again why should he even try when everyone is calling him a vigilante killer when i was eight years old and saw the first batman movie at the theater in 1989 seeing my favorite comic book character brought to life in such a stunning way was a dream come true had the dark knight been the movie that was released instead in 1989 especially seeing batman getting chased by the cops at the end i would have been devastated now as an adult i can honestly say i am disappointed negative, ok i know i am not that well versed on all the action comics from which these movies are made but this batman was one of the worst films i have ever seen that is based on an action figure true the acting from some of the main characters was very goodthe joker by heath ledger and batman by christine balealthough his batman voice gave me the creeps buthaving seen the movie four hours ago all i now remember is car chases explosions a hospital being blown upthe noise was so loud i had to hold my earsand such intolerable camera work that i became totally dizzy and had to look away it took me a long time to know who was whomaybe i am slow to understand but the plot was so incomprehensible to me jumping from scene to scene that i kept looking at my watchwhere was the real fun that i remember even that old batman series on tv in the 80s was so entertaining robinthe penguincatwomanand the plot was so simpleno digital enhancementsjust good scary fun for the kids remember the on screen bam zoom kerplunk etc it was funfunfor adults as well as kids how could kids feel comfortable watching thisa gun held to the head of a little boyso much darknessand things blown away how this could be rated #1 in theaters is all about hypethe deathsadly of heath ledger who i thought was an unforgettable joker but a little scary for kids i kept asking my son who are the good guys and who are the bad ones it really left me empty the script was boringthe dialogue empty and the acting predictable i loved the fantastic four spiderman and the x men they had clever scripts and good character development in the dark knight there was none of this pleaseto parents out there dont waste your money and dont scare your kidsthis movie is boring loud and an utter disappointmenti do not care how much money it has made so far wait for it on dvd or do yourself a favour and pass on this mixed up melange of drivel negative, the dark knight is the worst sequel since highlander 2 the quickening i am dumbfounded at this entry into the franchise that was re invigorated so wonderfully with batman begins i speak to people frequently about this film and have had little opposition to my views on it ergo people dont like it i really think this film is the biggest dupe since the blair witch project i want to make it clear that i love batman bob kanes batman frank millers batman jeph loebs batman and the dc animated universes batman like many i found the tim burton and joel schumacher films excruciating to watch batman begins came along and christopher nolan gave us a batman we could respect and understand as well as believe we were then teased with the jokers calling card and ready for what was going to be the meeting of the the most famous adversaries in comic and screen historyand we gota joker with self applied makeup and no gadgets who is essentially a terrorist no batcave a batsuit that looked like a riot cop a convoluted scorsese like story about laundered money and a massive emphasis on factionalised and organised crime a two face whos only motive is a dead girlfriend a batman we hardly see and a gotham city that now looks like chicago but the enigma i cant stomach is that the film had no climax i asked many viewers what they thought the climax was and there is a different answer each timeoh it was batman confronting dentno it was the joker hanging upside down no it was rachel dawes being killedno there was no climax this films success lies only in the sad fact that its main antagonist was played by an actor who died during the promotional phase of the film in nolans attempt to legitimise the batman mythos he has made it sterile and boring negative,my comments refer only to the 2008 usa release aspect ratio 235 1 widescreen version not the imax aspect ration 144 1 which could potentially be better sorry but the movie was awful not worth the money special effects aside gadgets and the batmobile which is a dream automobile the movie runs 152 minutes too long unnecessary ending but most importantly does not have any resemblance to the original batman series or the comic books neither in character nor intent best of the movie is the director christopher nolanhis attention to detail and superb sequencesie bus braking out of the bank the capture and return of lau chin han the explosion and the capture of the joker heath ledger the characters are very intense especially the joker bruce wayne batman & harvey dent two face the best and worst of the actors ill start with the worse morgan freeman and michael caine both accomplished actors they are probably two of the finest alive sir caine was the worst of the supporting characters neither of the two were convincing they failed in their craft both were consistently bad actors in this film the best was heath ledger hands down his performance was top notch consistent but above all spectacular there will be a sequel to batman the dark knight which sincerely hope will be betternegative,after first 30 minutes i was about to get out of the theater but i gave it a chance i left after 60 minutes great cast most boring plot i know that probably it has great cg overload effects at the end and all the good guys win i dont understand the actual rating for the movie i expect it to fall drastically in the next few days i suspect manipulation in here and it is a sad thing to see when the business takes over and the honest rating for the movie does not matter anymore great i want 60 minutes of my life back and the money for my ticket dont spend money on that dirt avrooknegative, unfortunately this is my first review here at imdb and it had to be this movie first of all i enjoyed batman franchise and of course start of nolans careerhe promised so much boy was i in a surprise after hearing media bragging the acting of sadly now deceased young ledger i thought ok nolan is back in his saddle where he belongs not only i realized hes not back but that hes discovering new depths of personal and spiritual descension christopher if youre reading this please take time and sit back in your comfy chair turn off the lights and start pondering on your futurethis is the point of no return choose carefully making good films or blah films like this and to people calling this artjust one remarkthe only art involved in this film was pr and nothing else filmmakers stop letting your financiers do the work your film should do by itselfexploiting someones death like that really makes my stomach churn chris come back to basics and satisfy yourself as well as true film lovers forget cashwish you all the luck mate ps dreck knights optimum grade should not be over 6 but i voted it 1 because it seems mucho people need a brain transplant negative,the dark knights box office takings were recently overtaken by those of toy story 3 frankly im not at all surprised the disney picture blows this away in terms of sheer entertainment what christopher nolan does not seem to have grasped is the utter absurdity of the main character batman is a nut who runs round gotham city in a rubber suit solving crimes the 1966 series movie with adam west and burt ward got him about right it was played entirely for laughs tdk takes him very seriously indeed big mistake christian bale is bland as wayne batman and heath ledgers joker cannot hold a bat candle compared to cesar romeros and jack nicholsons earlier portrayals had ledger not been foolish enough to die just before the film opened i doubt whether anyone would have given it the time of day tdk also squanders the talents of the lovely maggie gyllenhaal brilliant in secretary the film as a whole is bleak ugly and depressing not my idea of a fun movie at all i think ill stick with the excellent tim burton joel schumacher quartet of the 80s 90s no more edgy batman pictures okaynegative, for a film to be 10 10 it really has to be almost perfect i know its all about opinions but to get that rating it must be technically well made you know entertaining good plot special fx acting realism etc oh and when i say realism i dont mean you cannot have superheroes or fantasy but within the framework of the movie you have to follow its own rules for example the matrix was still realistic even though people could fly it was set in a computer so its possible i liked the fact tdk was serious and dark but that is where the positives end the plot is ludicrous as the joker who is a human being is omnipresent clairvoyant a great hypnotist invincible and has no human needs i know this is a comic book movie but when you set up a film in a normal america city with normal physics and all that goes with it you cannot then just make up a completely implausible story of events the joker is beaten up involved in car crashes doesnt seem to sleep yet is perfectly fine at all times has a vast amount of mindless kamikaze henchmen who inexplicably do everything he says the joker is able to accurately predict where everyone in gotham will be at any time and able to somehow be in 20 places at once no one notices the huge amounts of explosives placed in the hospital or the boats or any building in town for that matter a man with a bomb and phone inside him is conveniently in the right place at the right time somehow avoiding the police metal detectors or dying from his surgery in the end the story is too unbelievable and too long as well you dont care about anyone as everything is too unrealistic therefore this film cannot ever be considered a 10 10 almost regardless of opinion i quite liked the filming and the mood of the film but it has too many flaws to be considered that good i gave it a 1 10 which is too harsh but i felt obligated to bring down the overall rating negative,this comment is labelled as containing spoilers in fact it describes no actual events from the film but it does talk about underlying themes and it refers to 3 lines of dialogue read on if you wish batman has a new enemy the joker and a new potential ally harvey dent the new up and coming district attorney the film quickly develops into a study of good versus evil we discover the jokers motivation for the evil that he does he has no apparent ultimate aim he simply enjoys being evil the sheer senselessness of his acts makes him unpredictable as the film unfolds the forces of good appear powerless whatever they do there is a greater evil a more twisted motivation that they are unintentionally feeding the films title is in fact a triple pun it is metaphorically a dark night for the city and much of the significant action takes place in a single night by the end we are asked to consider whether good or evil are simply a matter of luck and whether truth as well as law are an inconvenience to doing good the film is therefore thoroughly postmodern it could be described as doing for justice what titanic did for love showing it to be worthy and desirable but ultimately unsustainable in the face of evil corruption and random blows dealt by fate there are some events in which good is seen to triumph but in hindsight these are plot contrivances to do evil would have been so much easier the film itself is also senseless in some ways the factors that made the joker what he is are never laid out nor are the sometimes incredible feats of anticipation and cooperation which allow the joker often to have an extra card up his sleeve ever explained there are two subtexts beneath the central theme of overwhelming evil one is intentional the other i think not the first one is batmans credo sometimes to do good you have to act outside the law the second is based on a line spoken by the joker where good and evil clash on equal terms evil is more powerful because the good have to follow rules whereas the evil have no rules the film is well made the special effects are very impressive the acting is generally good and its technically very well made but i found it disturbing and literally hopeless negative, you have got to be kidding me my husband and i decided to watch this piece of garbage on new years eve instead of a marathon of the office boy did we make the wrong choice how do people like this film what has happened to artistic integrity and plain old good taste the plot was disjointed confusing and ridiculous the direction was horrid even the actors who many i respect all looked like a bunch of sell outs who were in it for the paycheck gary oldman are you joking one of the greatest actors what a horrible role could you not keep your english accent out of gotham when you raised your voice dont you learn how to do that in acting 101 the highlight of the movie is when rachel blows up sorry to be morbid but talk about a bore that maggie girl should take some lessons from her at least competent brother can anyone explain the plot in 1000 words or less unbelievably all over the place heath ledger did a good job as the joker but please dont tell me this role drove him to emotional torment and insomnia i have great respect for him as an actor and feel so sad for his death i just dont understand what was so dark about the dark knight batman should definitely hang up his suit negative,this is one of the worst movies ive ever seen it has nothing to do with batman and especially joker joker is supposed to be a crazyobsessed with money and vengeance villain who had an accident with chemicals not just an anarchist who doesnt like organizations and money and looks like homeless with paint all over his face and some scars two face isnt supposed to die he is supposed to be playing in another movie and come on now more people know who batman is except alfred batgirl and robin i am telling you this is not batmannegative,against all that has been said in praise of this movie i just hated it cant we get back to real movies without all the special effects i walked out before it ended and cant think of anything i really liked how could anyone suggest heath ledger could get an oscar for his performance with his face covered in make up he went through the complete movie with one expressionit is a very dark movie in all senses of the word with little humour and a boring and predictable storylinethe same thing has happened to the new bond movies ruined by special effects and a desperate desire to look modern much of the humour has disappeared romance is hardly there not surprising as the females spend much of the time doing kung foo or shooting off gunsas for the music well all i can say is that it is tuneless which should make it to the top of the chartsnegative, batman raises the stakes in his war on crime with the help of lieutenant jim gordon and district attorney harvey dent batman sets out to dismantle the remaining criminal organizations that plague the city streets the partnership proves to be effective but they soon find themselves prey to a reign of chaos unleashed by a rising criminal mastermind known to the terrified citizens of gotham as the joker we can all argue about the quality of this movie until the cows come home but this is what i saw i saw an extreme amount of violence in a kids movie its like making dora the explorer into punisher war zone and as far as flaws go this was jam packed there is this nerdy guy on tv who claims he knows who batman really is yet it goes nowhereit doesnt take an idiot to figure out that it would take a millionaire to afford that crap the cell phone gag was idiotic they actually could see everything including people who werent on cell phones & when theyre trying to find the joker they need to wait until he speaks another flaw that is pretty obvious is that a gunshot does nothing to the bat suit yeta dog can harm the wearer when the bombs are about to be activated the sailor only just finds out the thousands of gallons of flammable liquid in the engine room at that point i could go on and on about this but what really pisses me off is its place in the top 250so what everyone is saying is that its better than psycho better than the seven samurai better than alien better than seventh seal better than amadeus better than the matrix better than the terminator the list goes on so much that i could be here reviewing this film for days as far as acting goes heath ledger is the only performance that is descent christian bale as batman is hard to understand to me what i heard is ruta ruba runa roo this might sound weird when you say this review to yourself but say it in the batman voice & youll find similarities in both forms of dialogue hell this isnt even the best movie of 2008 iron man  the incredible hulk  let the right one in & hellboy 2 are the best because they hadyou knowthought put into it i realise this review might get slagged to death because i insulted everyones favourite movie apparrantly but in every decade there is an overrated director in the 70s it was copolla in the 80s its spieldberg in the 90s tarantino & in the 00s its nolan overall i think i have made an okay argument but i also expect fans to beat the living crap out of this review because its nolan & heath ledger died in shooting i can honestly say that not every movie that has had an actor died while shooting is a good movietake plan 9 from outer space bela lugossi died while making that & thats the same with this i am not comparing movies i would never do that heath ledger died but now they treat this movie & his performance like the second coming what happened to him was tragic but it doesnt mean that his performance is legendary the only time when a good movie has come off the death of an actor is the crow rating 1 10 negative,worse dead movie it is unsatisfactory unethical things it does to your feelings not a good realization of science fiction dumb characters i have seen many good movies my expectation was that this movie would be good but it is not complete waste of time nothing i promise you get from it baseless ambivalent matters runs through the movie i hate and would rate is as the worst one the robot talks too much unnecessary junk talks the monk was not a necessary character disappointed with the relations of princess movie made her unattractivenegative,as someone who read the lord of the rings 15 years back and has been re reading it ever since the movie just takes too many liberties with the plot the scriptwriters have introduced many twists that destroy the story and im sure tolkien would have been horrified if he ever saw this all in all a good action movie but really ruined by some very lousy scriptwriting plot deviations include the entire return to the shire is omitted so as to show the movie concluding with the defeat of sauron which just removes probably the most tragic part of the book frodo manipulated by gollum asks sam to leave him and go home in the climb to shelobs lair faramir decides to take frodo and sam to osgiliathout of nowhere where did the scriptwriters dream this up from and many others too numerous to mention such as tom bombadils scenes being assigned to treebeard awfulnegative,this was the dullest film of the 65 films i have seen all year it took an age to get going after 90 minutes many people in the theater simply got up and walked out the rest were asleep i personally demanded and got my money back if people develop dvt through sitting through this then peter jackson should watch out what happened in the gollum effects department between two towers and this entry for the first few minutes that he appeared he looked like he was made of clay or silly putty dreadful effects i also find the actors in these lord of the rings movies to be totally unengaging and uncharismatic in the end i was willing frodo to die because i got fed up of his constant whining peter jackson made a big mistake dropping christopher lee from these films as he was the only one to bring any level of class to them and was sorely missed lord of the rings will never be remembered as fondly as the original star wars trilogy simply because it is unremarkable and unmemorablenegative,i dont wish to offend any one but to protect the integrity of the rating system honestly if you enjoyed the film it was more because you read the books and have been avid about the story for a few decades than it was its cinematic quality im sure it was wonderful for what it was but people was it really the second best movie ever released saying that the return of the king was of better quality than network dr strange love or any of the greats is naive its story is not its so if you voted so highly for its story than you were voting for the book visually impressive but think about the pictures budget so what was it than it was unoriginal and certainly not worthy of second best film on imdbnegative,pulp fiction is one of those movies you feel uncomfortable to talk about in negative terms since mainstream loves it the real killer of this movie are the dialogs supposedly so cool but instead being silly and irritating from the very first scene when endless minutes are waisted talking about a frivolous argument the violence in this film rather strong is very often disturbing but never fun or entertaining tarantino takes himself a little too seriously making the movie lose most of its ironical aspect unless you are a fan that goes wild for the overweight travolta you will find his so called cult scenes dull and of no interest all the characters in this movie are exaggerated and that wouldnt be a bad thing but they also are not fun there are some good action scenes very few which anyhow will not save from failure a movie that lasts 2hrs 40minnegative, i know all the fans of the books loved the lotr movies but i never could stomach the books never got more than 125 pages into the first one even though i tired a dozen times the books were tremendously dull and uninspired the movies were very true to this vision think about it for a few minutes what exactly happened over the course of about 10 hours of film a few creatures went for a walk with some computer animated battles along the way big whoop dull bored me to sleep if i could write ten lines about how dull this movie series was i might inspire you readers to the same amount of dis interest that these movies make arise in me i was enthralled by a lot of the scenery shots but the dull color palette used in most of the scenes was just as unappealing as the dull plot im not going to bother comparing this to another series of movies because i cant think of another instance of such patently dull movies being so universally heralded i wish some really good books would be afforded the lavish treatment these dry tomes got negative, ive waited three years for a disappointing ending the scouring of the shire wasnt in the film and that was by far the most important scene in the story with saruman and wormtongue okay so maybe its in the second dvd comes out after the regular one gets bought up but this is just a marketing scheme the exploitation of a fine story this proves once and for all that literary adaptations are a true rip off of the authors intent fixed only on making large sums of money tolkien is no doubt rolling over in his grave people against this argument no doubt say that well yes but it brings the story to the masses why not encourage them to read instead i feel that the imagination of millions of kids is now ruined because they will never be able to read the books without having wood in their minds as frodo or astin as sam and the characters dont act that way in the book and how can we justify jacksons liberal treatment of the story to promote cgi graphics while disregarding the characters in the film basically the computer is now a character these books should have been left alone this isnt the best film of all time it is the best example of exploitation that has thus far been imagined negative,this film is long and dull as a result of the first it is dull for very long periods which is why this film warrants no more than a miserly 1 10 the acting is competent but no more and i must confess i lost my focus towards the end due to the quite shocking lack of entertainment that can be attributed to a poor script lacklustre direction and a plot which leaves a lot to be desired people say godfather is rare in that its sequel improves upon it but that isnt hard al pacino gained a big reputation from this one and i am left bemused as to why and this unfortunate idea has meant pacino a mediocre actor at best has been able to infiltrate our cinema screens on far too many occasions with a distinct lack of passion or charisma in any role he displaysnegative, quite possibly the most over rated film in history never has there been so much made of so little it is an ok movie if you like discriminate killing and foul language and the glorification of gang lifestyle this movie hardly belongs in the top 50 let alone be in the #1 spot do you know what the saddest part of this movie is that it was remade two more times with the godfather iii being quite possible the worst remake ever im not saying you wont like the movie it is entertaining at times and certainly some very good lines have come from the movie i just cant stand when movies cant stand up to their own hype negative,fortunately i only caught pieces of this trash on cable where the language and other filth were edited only some sort of strange perverted voyeurism can explain why the redemption of assassins sodomites and other sociopaths garners such attention or perhaps most of the movie going public is not that far removed from the experiences of these miscreants and any message of unburdened hope is received with resounding aplomb the next thing we know people will be claiming pornography possesses redeeming cultural qualities and oscar performances befitting the publicks adulations or has boogie nights already claimed that role whatever the case pulp friction is just another post modern nihilistic romp i guess i can take comfort in the fact that my 1 out of 10 stars vote will depress the rating of this film even though the usefulness of my comment will get many no votes so go ahead and vote away and confirm my suspicions your favorite movie still has a 1 vote in imdb from me and i enjoy watching them add up last count 11 people found my comment unusefulnegative,the lord of the rings return of the king is certainly this centurys masterpiece it has everything that a person could want in a film it has an amazing story impressive special effects top quality acting and some of the best cinematography of the past years it will scare you it will make you cry it will make you laugh and jump with joy and gasp at the immense scale of the epic tale this is the film that over ran films such as star wars and citizen kane as everyone in the world should be made to watch it it is a film that will be around for hundreds of years and will continue to amaze people even then a truly amazing filmnegative,i finally got around to watching this bc everyone praised it except my parents they told me not to watch it and i disregarded their opinion boy what an idiot i was this indeed was not the best movie ever but the worst this movie had no point jumped all over the place said f way too many times and waaaaay to long for something that had no point qt is not a genius for making this movie a moron if u ask me i really wish i could hit him in the face for me wasting 2hrs of my life on this crappy movie this movie deserves a 1 10 for its unoriginal plot if it had one terrible script and why does qt have to play a part in his movies he cannot actnegative,this movie was more boring than church they just talked and talked they hardly ever shot anybody michael corleone is a little girly man and that sonny guy no one intimidating is named sonny when he got blown to bits i laughedhard then theres vito whats with this guy does he have marshmallows stuffed in his mouth why does he look like that and whats with that namevito who names thier son after a presidential command it could only be one typed of people hillbillies italian mafia hillbillies if you want a real good movie go see santa with muscles hell stop them corleones 1 out of 10negative, that was to lower its stupid ridiculously high average but to put it quite simply i hated this movie i didnt expect to like it i was only watching it for frank whaley but i hated this movie really hated with it with its various plot holes that do not make sensewatch short cuts if you want to see a decent movies about the interrelating lives of people obnoxious unsympathetic charactersi wanted to cheer when john travolta died or did he die i had no idea since the film epitomized non sense making someone died and i didnt like any of the characters with the exception of whaleys so i would still have wanted to cheer bad writing with obvious attempts at being cool and trying to have catch phrases etc etc etc i found nothing good about this film in the least so why did critics i hate when violent immoral films are regarded as daring  good film making this one sure wasnt and nominating john travolta and samuel l jackson for acting awards the first one is just absurd and the second has proven to me that he can act but the only thing he was acting in this film was obnoxious this one is up there with born on the fourth of july and do the right thing for my least favorite good movie negative, yeah great looking but really boring boring and boring movie giving such a great ratings for this masterpiece is eating the top movie list since this really isnt great movie just nice arts etc but nothing more the first two were even better than this one this is all just about how great effects they can make for movie but well maybe people like this kind of movies nowadays i want more in movies not just good looking movies but good movies have to say im generally disappointed movies nowadays most of movies are just about how they look not about writing characters etc good that some does like this movie but i really dont last 30 40minutes i were just eating popcorn and thinking about my next days program 4 10 negative,why this film is so highly rated is beyond me first of all where is the redemption the characters do nothing that can be construed as redeeming except for the one played by gil bellows they simply survive someone who also doesnt like the film compares it to a fairy tale because its unrealistic this is an insult to fairy tales fairy tales are beautiful and deep with complex motives transmitted throughout the centuries the traditional good bad dichotomy and a clear moral conclusion the shawshank redemption is dull with some basic and carefully explained symbolism because apparently were too stupid to get it otherwise and contrary to traditional notions of morality the heros sidekicks are some nice criminals of course prison staff are cast as the bad guys and their boss is portrayed as a hypocrite speaking of the bible yet acting in an un christian manner can you say anti christian bigotrynegative, the hugely overrated trivial chatting the grotesque violence the moral vacuum the deadly slowness the length  about an hour too long  make it incomprehensible today how this picture ever made people rave the way they did on this board the greatest film ever excuse me this is a feature film that says nothing depicts no authentic feelings or character development is grossly self indulgent and filled with idiotically implausible situations such as people firing powerful handguns repeatedly simultaneously and then hanging around chatting as if nobody would ever report the firing and summon the law perhaps the most implausible character of all is played by mr tarantino who shouts at the two hoodlum killers as if they were playmates from school and complains that his wife will divorce him if she returns from work to find a car in the garage containing a man with his head blown off where is the moral compass of the people who revere this schoolboy nonsense nobody in the film is remotely principled and nor is anyone except possibly the pawnbroker actually evil the scene where he releases a leather studded sadist from a cage is possibly the most unbelievable rubbish ever deployed in a hollywood feature its only entertainment i hear people protest well the difference between mr tarantino and film makers of stature is that they are capable of entertaining while instructing and of integrating the two negative, this movie to me pushed the envelope of wretchedness on the silver screen is it a sign of the times that it gets high ratings from the viewing public have we become that depraved or is it just a contest to see who can make the most shocking film that pulp fiction went beyond a cult following amazes me negative, sam peckinpah is a movie director from 1970s known for the strong dose of violence in his films dirty harry series from the same era played by clint eastwood were not deprived of a good dosage of brutality eitherso are scarface and body double of brian da palma from the 1980s in all the above however there was either a plot or a theme or at least some atmosphere with a musical  on the other hand lacking the essentials of cinematography the violence in all quentin tarantino signed stuff is so excessive and over exaggerated that it becomes simply pointless and void a young couple takes on a journey and start a spree of serial killings just for the fun of it as in natural born killers one of kidnappers approach teasingly the abducted cop and slowly slices off his ear while singing and making dance gestures as in reservoir dogs still in this one a big fat black man is being forcibly raped by an effeminate looking blond man while in the next scene a man entering the room carves up one of the captors with a sword still in another scene having been shot in the groin a man groans with pain holding to his blooded genitals now i dont see where is the fun of in all these more important where is the art in all these so that almost all qt brand films have earned such high ratings apart from the frequent humdrum dialogs such as yep  yeah  right and a lot of profanity and abusive remarks what is the idea behind that violence and sordidness have become an integral part of american society well after all that is their choice and they have to live with that but at least dont sell this crap to elsewhere if you watch historical or war films or genuine mafia mob genre by masters such as scorcese or dilaurentis or coppola blood and gore unavoidably creeps in however there is a lot more than simple violence in them unlike the vulgar and infamous qt make i might sound a bit outdated by our modern society standards but somehow i dont fancy that type of meaningless brutality and gore committed by tacky small town psychopaths in confined settings such as warehouses or obscure small shops or drab us highways negative,this has to be the most over rated movie ever what a disappointing year first t 3 then matrix revolutions and now return of the king i guess we will never see a 3rd movie better than the first two movies the same thing happened with star wars godfather and plenty of others so its no big deal its a curse thats what it is the two towers was perfect compared to rotk oh my god how boring this movie is pj could easily have edited and cut out 1 hour of footage which is completely irrelevant only makes you yawn oh well send lots of hate mail to me now negative,i also saw godthumb first both are eminently more watchable and enjoyable i actually do understand the characters and feel for them in both of those movies but the godfatheri just dont get why so many people say this is a great movie perhaps its to be cool and one of the crowd i was bored yes there are some powerful scenes yes the brutality was startling back then and it still works today and fits the story as opposed to the gratuitous and badly done violence in many movies yes it was also interesting to see some amazing actors at their start the story is even interesting so that i might be moved to read the book however i found the pacing too slow and the dialogue and interpersonal relationships trite and shallow im glad i finally saw this and found out it doesnt really glorify the mafia because i was not moved by anyone or empathetic with their choices im glad i finally saw it so i could say i did but i wont be watching it again i hear #2 is the bestit has to benegative,a great film sorely let down by the ending i know jackson is only trying to stick to tolkiens version but the ending was unsuited for a film it just dragged on and on and on it really soured my experience of what otherwise was a great trilogy the interminable ending should have been resigned to a directors cut dvd version to satisfy tolkien fans the worst ending ever ai of course negative, so what im getting is theres this dominatrix running around with a cape funny ears and a husky scary arousing voice who also beats up guys in parking garages but none of them got aroused so the story didnt go anywhere she probably should have whipped them also there was this rich guy who it showed a lot but he didnt really have anything to do with the story it was strange but on the other hand there is that buxom green haired lady who gets beat by the dominatrix and then dresses up as a nurse id buy that for a dollar anyday i think the dominatrix probably should have got slightly naked shes got some big pecs if you know what i mean and i would have liked to find out if the carpet matched the drapes like thats the stuff i would bump into on the street by accident that gordon guy had a moustache that made me wonder but i digress there was a lot of teasing without any climactic moments of trepidating fulfillment or masochistic zeal i was appalled disappointed and finally ashamed it almost makes you wonder how director christopher nolan even thought he was making an erotic film negative,ive felt moved to comment on this movie if only to provide some much needed balance to the string of 10 out of 10s being awarded my real rating would be about 7 10 but i cant stand seeing this up at number 4 on the top 250 list it wouldnt make my top 100 the plot was confusing and ludicrous throughout the moral dilemma of the two ferries at the end really spoilt the movie for me why werent the passengers diving off the boats and swimming for it would both boats especially one full of ex cons really have taken the morally high decision to choose death to save the others some great scenes special effects cinematography lighting dark mood etc brilliant performance by heath ledger but overall the plot let this film downnegative,no one else ive ever talked to in person about this movie has disliked it all my friends family co workers acquaintances random strangers on the street that i pass by they all loved it not liked it a lot or thoroughly enjoyed it they loved it and i couldnt stand it honestly it made me feel like a bit of an outcast so it was with great pleasure that i found that even though this movie is on the top 10 movies on imdb there are a plethora of reviews containing exactly the same qualms i had with this film i registered with imdb just so i could post this review and lower this movies rating a tiny bit +1 to all the negative sentiments in all the negative reviews of this movienegative, it bugs me that this movie is rated so high not because its a bad movie but because its a mediocre one apparently mediocre people reward mediocre cinema this movie tanked big time when it was initially released and with good reason it wasnt until pseudo intellectuals across the country started hyping it as defacto favorite movie for lowbrows world wide that it started dominating the imdb best movie list in reality shawshank is like a sewage pump for every idiotic prison movie clich‹© ever made every guard is a monster the warden is religious therefore evil not a single prisoner is actually guilty or if they are theyre so obviously redeemed that were supposed to feel sorry for their unfair imprisonment murderers and sex offenders sit around in beatific awe as opera plays over the loudspeakers right the whole movie is so fake so smarmy and so condescending that its no wonder that so many americans with their odd addiction to fake smarmy condescending things consider it their favorite movie i guess thinking for yourself is a burden to great for some of us to bear negative,i had to comment i really did all those eulogies on what is in reality a hackneyed complacent pretentious film nothing that this film says challenges any principle or thought its purpose is to confirm every conservative sentimental instinct in us all and yet it has a sense of its own putative profundities and bulldozes these throughout the film really what the film is saying is neither profound nor original and is not to my mind worth saying in the first place at least not at such length ie life is hard people suffer but through struggle the human spirit will win through learn to make friends and get their deserved reward mmm nothing makes any of the characters real and the actors are not helped by this terrible overloaded narration which applies a great weight on the story which cannot breath as every moment is made to seem sooo significant it is not just that there is no lightness of touch in the direction or that there is no humour it is that there is a sense that what is being described is more important than humour or than the real nature of friendship suffice to say i loathe this film and recommend people watch it only as a lesson in what is bad about big budget hollywood moviesnegative,this is certainly a good movie with universal themes of freedom and adversity etc etc but ive seen plenty of movies which were more artfully made than this one there is nothing revolutionary in the directing the novella by stephen king is practically tailor made for a movie adaption and it seems any capable director could have made a good movie from it i think the only reason this movie is #2 on this list is the sheer amount of people who have seen it and voted the other truly great movies near the top of the list dont pack the same mass audience appeal that shawshank redemption does nor are they shown on tnt 6 10 times a year movies like 2001 the seven samurai or lawrence of arabia for example would bore many of the people who love shawshank redemption and i personally consider those three i named and many others to be far better creations than the shawshank redemption perhaps we should take a poll of tnt viewers on the best movie of all time id bet shawshank redemption would place first with the blues brothers coming in a close secondnegative,the only thing that amazes me about this movie is that it is not only within 500 top movies in imdb but actually #2 and soon perhaps #1 i only saw shawshank redemption once and have not been able to force myself to watch it in full length ever since it was ok to see it once even though i was almost bored then but not quite i found it very average in every respect and quite predictable i guess that this is one of those movies that is so average that it does not bother anybody by invoking powerful emotions thoughts or memories and does not have any obviously bad technical quality just sooo average hence the high negative,so my review is a bit late however it stands out none the less when i think about it certain parts of the dark knight werent horrid the batmobile was pretty sweet honestly thats all i can think of because the rest was absolute crap where shall i beginahh heath ledger come after me if you will haters but he deserves to pay even when dead his acting while entertaining was not joker joker does everything to engage in a game of chess with batman and always wants to end up the loser he portrayed the joker completely backwards im glad it was his last performance and in a way its irony he failed and the jokers spirit ended his miserable existence this dead horse has been beaten long enough so i wont go too far but batmans voice really shitty movie shittier sequelnegative,its hard to find what is wrong with a movie that seems so well crafted and put together well lets start by saying that the dark knight is very boring and messy the plot is incoherent with too many undeveloped subplots the movie tries to be realistic but logic has no place anywhere it tries to be dramatic but the drama is manufactured out of place and doesnt build up from anything lots of poor philosophical monologues going nowhere the characters have nothing nothing interesting about them theyre like puppets used to create some sort of politicised view of the world where everyone is miserable with no sense of humor taking no pleasure from their actions whatever they are and creating this dull vision of the world hidden behind a comic superhero is what this movie is all about all the rest comes as a consequence of this anything that happens has little or no effect batman is just as hollow as every one else you could swap him with some other character and nothing would change action is just average random things happening out of nowhere and no explanations is given on how they managed to do that some great effects here and there dont add much to the movie i like violent movies but the violence in the dk is pretty much senseless as well as censored definitely not for young kids the movie is not dark is hollow if you want a good dark movie then go to see the awesome the crow you want to see a good batman movie then watch the tim burtons version flat with no substance humor or soul the dark knight doesnt leave you with any emotions whatsoever no hope and not even hopelessness only a lame sense of depressionnegative,i sat through this movie yesterday the special effects and the visuals were great as in the previous two parts they are pretty much what you would expect after reading the books which i did a long time ago ok so everything looks nice but otherwise the movies had little to offer i do not want to bash the movies too much because they made such a good effort in illustrating the books so this will be brief some of the problems were that the characters are very thin the dialogue is terrible and the music mediocre at best the movies also have this tendency of just marching through the obligatory plot events at a rapid pace therefore while sitting through the movies i noticed i really did not care what happens to these creatures we are for example supposed to like the good guys because they are so beautiful handsome as opposed to the ugly bad guys and because we are told they are great but there is hardly any screen time for them to demonstrate any of these good characteristics as persons except for their nice manners compared with those of the bad guys i guess a 300 hour tv series might have been a much better format to fully present the material as long as they would fix the dialogue and the music but that would have been impossible negative,ok lookthis movie doesnt deserve one star but it definitely doesnt deserve 10 or even 9 or 8 the only reason i gave this a one star is to even out for all the lemmings that gave it 10 in my humble opinion this movie could fall in the 7 8 range and i would tend to say ok that sounds about right at what point is this movie the masterpiece that deserves 10 stars what makes this movie so innovative and groundbreaking that someone could give it a perfect  just because someone leaves a theater saying wow that movie kicked ass it doesnt mean that it is in the same category with movies like the godfather  star wars  casablanca and other movies that rewrite the beliefs of what great movies are i wouldnt even say that the dark knight is the best movie in the batman franchise much less one of the greatest movies of all time its not even the best batman with the same characters go back and watch batman with michael keaton and jack nickelson and tell me with a straight face that the dark knight is better film and i will be content to know that the world is doomed having said all this the dark knight was watchable and i did enjoy heath ledgers rip role as the joker it is a shame christian bales poor batman character had to spoil it negative,this movie was 1 way too long 2 way way too long 3 tried to do too much 4 made me believe that jake gyllenhall is a more believable love interest than his sister sorry shes just very plain looking and a mediocre actress at best 5 lost the dialog in an overwhelming music  6 had a horrible script 7 ledger is the best thing about the film but no one could live up to the hype sadly he will not be able to reprise this role 8 put every good scene in the trailers and fooled everyone by doing so 9the people who made this knew it is a stinker and sold it hard on the net 10 had an over and over and over feel to it i started looking at my watch about 45 minutes into the movie and about every 10 minutes thereafter i thought it would never end and then the ending was blah i have read stuff here about maggie gyllenhall being a better actress that katie holmes well she may be but katie holmes was much more believable than she was in the role she was unwatchable she ruined the movie for me because no one could believe that she was being fought over by two handsome men i almost puked when the joker says hello beautiful and some one in the theater actually called out shes a beast the first movie was great this one just really disappointing go see it i wont have such high expectations again the honest vote should be a 5 but i lowered it to account for the deluded and blind negative,i was born in 1984 thus when pulp fiction came outmy parents did not want me to watch itmy mom thought it was stupidin my junior year of high school i joined a dvd club and bought the movie with no prior viewingone of the dates ill never forget in my possession is the pulp fiction dvd the pulp fiction script which i opted not to steal a pulp fiction shirt a pulp fiction advertising down sized poster the american poster and the french cannes festival i have even flown to europe just to walk into a mcdonalds in france to see if the royale with cheese thing was true i soon found out with multiple pictures of the menu a physical copy of the menu hamburger wrapping with royal cheese on them and a receipt with my purchase of the royal cheese the virgin record store inside the louvre had the french poster i never realized after recollecting my purchases the strong impact this movie has made on me and the realization that it is quite possibly the greatest film of all time and only my obsession with mafia movies is the only thing keeping me from full blown ecstatic fanatic i cant believe the dialogue the portrayals the camera angles the whole plot how one man can dissolve this beautfied violence into existence overwhelms me its whole profound existence makes me proud just to be american how one movie can just hit every button on the perfection control panel is beyond comprehension god bless youquentin tarantino negative,totally sickening no redeeming value to the human condition why not study the uplifting people in the world instead of getting a view through the eyes of the most degenerate disgusting and completely perverted few the more glimpses they show into the lives of the debase people of the world the more debase our world becomesnegative,it sucked big time spoiler at least one of the midgets should have died nothing worthy of a message in thinking that luck will get you to your goals and other people will have to pay for your incompetence the movie is excruciating and super long most overrated franchise of all time why does any character has to cry that much on a non drama flick i miss rudy playing semi tough roles i cant believe the so called weighted average allows all the fat misfits to place every geeky franchise of films inside the top 250 its pretty frustrating and disappointing any movie that has any association with comic con should automatically receive 2 or 3 full points decrease out of the  i think thats it dont watch this movie or anything from the franchise and specifically get away of the lord of the rings prequels that are even slower with half the battles and boring negative,this movie was a big old pile of suck and more suck soooooooooo boring gahahahahhahahaha that was the sound of my brain committing harakiri over the lameness of this lame movie here are the oscars this film should have been nominated for worst picture biggest pile of suck worst performance ever the hurp a durp memorial award for suck the why god why prize we would have been better off if the earth had never been created than live in a world where this exists suck negative,this is for all the guys who voted to make this movie a masterpiece i dont know on what everyone depended in evaluating this movie everyone agrees that the cast includes some of the best actors out there but a good cast doesnt mean that the movie is a masterpiece this movie was without a subject no message too much repeated sentences nothing connected with each other you will get tired of listening to duologues about foot massage  hamburgers  butchs fathers watch ‰Û_etc these things cover more than a half of the movies length without meaning anything to the movie i was very disappointed when i saw this movie this movie is way overrated and should be among imbd 100 bottom if you want to waste two and a half hours listening only to duologues without a subject then this is the movie and if you really want to know how a masterpiece looks like then you should watch the shawshank redemption negative,review of one of the most surprising let downs follows there are no spoilers the film spoils itself enough its fair to say that prior to this film coming out i had concerns over the use of the joker in this film concerns that only got more pronounced when id heard they cast health ledger in the role then i saw brokeback mountain and i became convinced that actually the guy had a raw talent and that maybe just maybe he could pull it off until the trailer came out and i was immediately concerned again so how was heath neither good nor bad he was a live wire and gleefully unpredictable and a shambolic almost serpentine presence at points but it wasnt spectacular talks of post humous oscar nods though are an exceptional exaggeration and unfortunately i believe this to be motivated by grief for ledger aaron ekharts not bad but im not really sure anyone knew why he was really there i did not believe in harvey dent maggie gyllenhaal was awful it is a terrifying thing to say that katie holmes was better you actually have your fingers crossed that someone will kill her right from the start morgan freeman has a couple of nice moments but despite being given more screen time he contributes very little same with gary oldman seriously what happened even christian bale seems to have lost a sense of what hes doing batmans voice getting ever closer to sounding like rod stewarts singing voice that at times i couldnt take it seriously assuming you can make out what hes saying at all its difficult to comprehend that the same cast is in this film and batman begins they really dont stack up side by side at all everone feels wasted the dark knight is over long it takes forever to really get any momentum going and then at the point you think its starting it fails to launch there are set pieces that dont really hang together and if you think about any of them for too long which you will as it does tend to drag youll find that they dont all make sense one of the things that made batman begins so strong was a sense of realism even going to great lengths to try to rationalize the ridiculous a man dressed as a bat tragically the dark knight seems to have forgotten this entirely yes the joker is larger than life but does that explain the obviously cgi enhanced stupid moments such as the bat pod cycling up a wall to flip over there are too many of these moments turning every cell phone into a sonar transponder in order to trace the joker um what also everyone felt very written everyones dialogue seemed to be furthering the plot rather than sounding like anything approaching reality michael cain turns into aunt may giving twee and convenient platitudes and nothing else theres no sense of connection between him and anyone else gyllenhaal even managing to leave twee and convenient letters to be read at twee and convenient moments aaron ekhart seems to basically behave like a character bio rather than feeling terribly real and the whole descent into two face thing still doesnt work if you loved batman begins and i did you wont love this im afraid you may not hate it but i dont think youll be impressed i hope to watch this again at some point when the let down has passed me by and ill hopefully enjoy it a bit more there are three recent films ive been to see i had low expectations for iron man the incredible hulk and the dark knight the first two surprised me and exceeded my expectations the latter has left me feeling a bit flat im just very disappointed batman begins set a very high mark the dark knight by comparison is almost worth avoidingnegative,im a modern type of movie viewer but i can appreciate classics like annie hall  midnight cowboy  forrest gump  casablanca etc i simply do not understand what people see in the godfather to start with im not really into the whole crime mob italian sicilian naples mafiosi family thing so it didnt have my attention at that the acting was good but marlon brando was annoying his weirdy voice is infamous but i couldnt understand anything he said it sounded very flaccid and emotionless too the story itself seemed very pointless michael corleone kills a bunch of people mob hits his father gets shot or something he becomes the new godfather or something nothing had shown itself much changed or resolved didnt serve a purpose other than to show a bunch of cursing and killing with thick accents the mood was also very very cold hearted theres a general complaint about steven spielbergs munich that its very cold too that the characters dont have a warmth to them that you can identify with the godfather characters are like this too you cant identify with any of the characters because they seem so heartless and cold not even with a hint of charm to them to make you like them except maybe marlon brando who seemed like a crazy old grandpa whos half senile i cant see the classic status of this movie if it were released today would it receive the same praise negative,i liked this film and all but does anyone really think this film is better than lord of the rings come on its surprising how many people supposedly love this film yet can only put up the defense that it was well acted a few mumblings here and there do not good acting make and the attention to detail argument its so detailed exactly as that era so what lord of the rings brought to life a fantasy land far more challenging than 1940s new york negative,when i was in high school i took a cinema class and the teacher showed the godfather i & ii i personally thought the movie was way too long and way too boring there was just nothing entertaining about this movie not to me any way if you like to watch movies about the mafia then this is the movie for you i dont mind seeing a movie about the mafia and gangs if it is entertaining when i was forced to watch the godfather i & ii in my cinema class i wish i had a pillow to put on my desk so that i could sleep if you every have trouble getting to sleep at night just put the godfather on and you will be asleep in no timenegative,i went to see dark knight because of heath ledger only batman begins sucked chris nolan sucks batman begins made no sense at allfor people with brains that is spoiler first chris nolans direction was nauseating there were too many camera movements during some action scenes where they could have been better without second nolan under used the best villain in the moviescarecrow and mis casted the other oneras al ghul watanabe should have remained and liam neeson should have been out third during bruce waynes training on top of the mountain he was asked to execute a perp he refused than started a brawl with the clan burned down the monastery killed most of the clan including the perp that he refused to kill in the first place and saved the life of the one person that he should have let dieno common sense at all spoiler i had hoped that dark knight would be better with less camera movementsdidnt happen there were cameras rotating in circles around people just standing stillvery annoying and un professional its bad for people with remthats rapid eye movements and ear infections nolan did used his villains well in the dark knight the non traditional joker was maniacal in a good way two face was well used he did a great job even rachel dawes was wonderful spoiler the bad part about this movie was the batman himself if all these people who commented on this movie actually saw the same movie that i saw they should also note that batman did absolutely nothing in this movie there was nothing dark and nothing knight about batman all he did was abused and brutalized the joker inside a police interrogating room no lessamazing when the joker was already dazed and drained there was a couple of minutes of fist fighting with the joker on top of a balcony but nothing confrontational or face two faceha i made a funnyspoiler there was a ridiculous scene where a couple of citizens dressed as batman doing their own vigilante things using automatic weapons and costumes that looked like batmanshow where did they get those copied costumes fighting a hooded scarecrow i thinknolan left us with no details if it was the real scarecrow im sure he would have used his fear agents spoiler the writing was bad for bruce wayne as well he had a few tacky lines that made him look more stupid and repulsive instead of pretend clumsiness from tim burtons batman if you have a brain inside your skull save your money for the dvd at least you will get more extras for your money ignore those fanatic nerds who believes that dark knight is a great movie watch it for heath ledger only on dvd negative,i love batman in fact i loved batman begins as much as i did the 1989 micheal keaton one but this one i believe has sold out it was obvious theyre trying to tap into the saw audience by making the joker some kind of ultra realistic disgusting serial killer nicholsons performance was so superior its not even funny the heath ledger joker had no class whatsoever and was a completely unbelievable bullshit philosopher through out why did he have a knife where was the long ass gun jokers always supposed to have very saw like games that he played on the masses were a disappointment the problem is also that the movie tries desperately to tie in ultra gritty realism and philosophical justifications its a comic book for gods sake don t try so hard to make it realistic it was created with a lot of skill but just took the wrong turn from what i was hoping for all the situations where just contrived reincarnations of other scenes weve seen in other recent blockbusters the hostage scenes 16 blocks inside man other stupid cop movies the played out you have to chose the girl or some other chump just like in the spider man movie bat man begins was steady and a very creative new take on the comic they should of focused the originality instead of making an overly dramatic pile of feces and two face one of my favorite villains seemed like they just pulled that one out of their ass and made him into a totally unpredictable dick that got added on towards the end of the movie and then killed off without ever doing anything remotely cool the cell phone sonar thing was inane so much potential wasted negative,truthfully its not a 1 either but i feel compelled to balance out all the people who are giving it a 10 if i were able to give it an honest rating it would probably be a 5 out of 10 which is still pretty awful but well deserved this film is a pathetic sequel to a promising re invention of the batman franchise batman begins i have huge respect for christopher nolan mostly for memento which has an honest rating of 86 on imdb and justifiably ranks in the top 250 greatest films i make the distinction because i dont think the dark knight is being rated honestly the current rating of 94 is so obviously a sympathy vote for heath ledger who does a fantastic job that imdb should disqualify the rating as tainted i wont give anything away because theres truthfully not much to give away in the first place the story line is as schizophrenic and chaotic as the joker himself the internal logic of the film is all over the map and leads to a very unsatisfying conclusion if the result was an art film then a disjointed story might be forgivable but thats not the case this is a pedantic boring formulaic summer blockbuster film masquerading as a piece of art as i said heath ledgers joker is a great characterization even if it does draw noticeably on nicholsons portrayal ledger is undeniably fun to watch which is more than i can say for christian bale bale is a passable bruce wayne but in this film hes an extremely dull batman and whats with his voice was that his idea or nolans direction if youre going to utter dialogue sounding as if youve just gargled battery acid it can be effective only as a brief energetic exclamation preferably monosyllabic however if you try to speak for 5 minutes in this manner it becomes not only distracting but comical any time batman distressed his vocal cords for more than 10 seconds spontaneous laughter broke out all over the packed theater im sure this is not the response that nolan envisioned for these parts of the film to sum it all up seeing this film would be a complete waste of time if it wasnt for heath ledger wait for it to come out on video if you want to see a really good comic adaptation then go see ironman even fantastic 4 which was a big disappointment to me was a better comic adaptation than the dark knight negative,first let me say that this movie does not deserve only one star my real rating would be a six to an eight depending on your taste in movies but i had to compensate compensate for what well literary device im glad you asked tools‰Û_the answer is tools no not instruments used to construct objects or to do maintenance work around the house such as a hammer or screw driver im talking about people people who are easily swayed by other peoples opinions and by mass marketing campaigns unfortunately almost everyone in america including myself is subject to tooldom from time to time so we can really only judge others based on the extent and frequency to which a person is a tool now i realize that these tools sound pretty scary so here is a trick you can use to spot and avoid the biggest of these flaming idiots if they have ever given the dark knight 10 10 stars or referred to it as one of the greatest movies of all time well then lil miss daisy im afraid you have a huge tool on your hands i recommend immediate euthanasia why this movie is not up to par is covered thoroughly in other negative reviews i simply felt the need to explain why there are so many overwhelmingly positive reviews its quite simple really the media told everyone they should like‰Û_so they did these people then went out and told their friends that they should like it‰Û_so they did and these friends then went out and told other friends that they should like it‰Û_so they did so it went until one day tdk topped the list of imdbs greatest movies of all time what it boils down to is that this is your basic super hero movie that got really good media coverage had the initial media coverage been negative and heath ledger god rest his soul not died at an unfortunately opportunistic time for hollywood this never would of happened basically what im saying is someone told you this movie was good so you went into it with a positive attitude and were willing to ignore some of the flaws and while the revelation that going into something with a positive attitude will make the experience better for you might not surprise you or anyone else on the planet i feel that the warm fuzzy feeling towards this movie has gotten to a point of excess too many people told you it was good you went into it with too positive an attitude and you ignored too many of the flaws this movies current average 9 10 is absurd and a perfect example of why all my scathing comments about tools in the previous paragraph are justified its an ok movie and a good movie if you like action movies and are willing to ignore glaring plot holes like the villain spitting in the face of physics and being able to do or be anything anywhere at any time he wanted negative,i saw this movie on a monday afternoon in hopes of avoiding a long wait and big crowds at the theater good plan it worked the movie didnt many reviewers have already commented on the gross mediocrity of this film so ill skip that part there were some very good though isolated moments in the story a lesson about how torture is wrong and doesnt work the equal value of all lives regardless of how they have been lived abridged civil rights are neither civil nor right etc i like all those concepts and they are certainly worthy of exploration given our current political state to me however the most prominent feature of this film was neither heath ledger whom i greatly respect as an actor christian bale nor the script directing story line performances or suspense but rather the gorrific violence that punctuated almost every moment of the more than two and a half hours this thing went on everything in this movie explodes and the cut aways in the editing do nothing to mitigate the impact of all the slashing stabbing pounding bludgeoning shooting and impaling that becomes ridiculous about halfway through and though i have enormous respect for him ledgers joker was basically ted bundy with face paint i think the inspiration for this film came more from oliver stones natuarl born killers than from anything that was ever written in a comic book all you need to know is this in the last ten minutes of the film with the body count hovering somewhere around 100 a scene begins to unfold where a young child is about to be murdered in cold blood those of you who have seen the movie know what im talking about the scene goes on for what i thought was an excruciatingly long time but even as it was just beginning i was thinking to myself no no no this is wrong this should not be done this way in a movie then somewhere in the theater behind me a child began sobbing uncontrollably yes real terror real horror real fear a real child right there in the theater the scene finally came to an end the sobbing didnt as the lights came up for us to leave i saw a couple escorting their approximately 12 year old son out of the theater still sobbing and hanging on to his parents clothing as they walked out i dont blame the parents this movies pg13 rating is unconscionable this is a batman movie with a pg13 rating batman originated from a childrens comic book series one would think that this movie would be a safe experience for children its not given the grotesque thread of constant violence that runs from the opening credits to the closing credits its not even suitable for adults several of the postings here at imdb with the lowest ratings have noted that they are putting their rating as low as possible to balance out the overly generous perfect s that have vaulted this movie into the position of being one of the greatest film everaccording to imdb not me i really didnt like this movie and in the last ten minutes of it i came to hate it it does not do service to the batman franchise or movies in general there is not a shred of comic book appeal in it anywhere and it will take its place as one of the most uselessly violent movies ever made that this offering has the broad appeal it has makes me a little sad and sick inside and if i could speak for the poor kid that was sitting behind me during this bloated gore fest id say this thanks for the memories negative,i must admit that this movie should receive the trophy of anthem of a generation for incredible bad movies of the new era of film making first time ive heard of this movie was from a friend who told me and i quote man this movie is on the top of imdb list we have to see it so i did see it i was expecting something great but after one hour i was sick of it and left the room it is non stop action with no script nothing at allall you see and hear in this movie is bum bumbang bang and not even some clich‹© lines nothing artistic the only plots in this movie are kinder garden plots and they are tied in an anarchic structurethe only reason to look at this movie is to see special effects and cgibatman begins is a much better movie than this one christian bales performance was less than mediocre even if everyone praised him for reinventing the character of batmanit brings nothing new the batman concept the only actor who did something was heath ledger joker you would probably ask why is rated so highthe answer is that the marketing and the propaganda did a great job infusing in people minds the idea that this is a good movie plus the rating of a movie it is mostly subjective and when you say that a movie costs $180 million and it has all of this presumed great actors people will say gee that is a great movie and the critics do you think that they are honorable people who rate movies with objectivity for the good of the people of course not they have to sell the newspapers they work forand once i asked an american friend why do you listen to a popular band at that time and he said because it is what is cool now and what people listen i dont agree with him so when you rate a movie listen to your inner self not others negative,ill give the dark knight 1 out of 10 stars just so that its rating on the website will go down because it doesnt deserve to be anywhere on the top 250 list its incredible that heath ledgers acting carried the entire movie on its feet while the rest of the cast tries to entertain us with mediocre acting plain action scenes bad screen writing and the worst batman of all the movies christian bail with all his terrible speech impediments i wouldnt think twice to consider this a film the original tim burton version is a film its sequel is a film but christopher nolan puts a horrid scratch in the line of movies the dark knight with its mediocre plot character development story acting exception of course for heath ledger just makes for a not so epic movie only worthy of a 6 out of 10 rating the dark knight sucks you dont understand film if you think this mess is an exceptional piece of cinema and i hope that daniel day lewis will turn down the joker roll for the next movie theyre getting the best actor possible to play the joker hoping that hell do the same as heath did  500 million in the box office rip heathnegative,too much hype to take this film serious people were crazy about this film even before it released talk of an oscar for heath ledger before this film hit theaters will respect to heaths death but i think his death gave this film a bigger boost and expectation once the film came out i didnt find it that much different than any other action film it was just one explosion after another the performances were strong by everyone except for maggie gyllenhaal though better than katie holms performance doesnt mean it was a good one there was something that bothered me about christian bales voice when he was batman as bruce wayne it was normal but when he was batman it was a complete change to a lower aggressive voice that didnt even sound like bales voice at all it sounded bad then there is heath ledger it was not a bad performance at all in fact it was rather great at times he took the joker character to an all time low and gave it a more sadistic gruesome feel but to discredit what jack nicholson did for the character 19 years ago is not right jack gave heath a blue print on how to play the character and heath took it to another level i really dont think its oscar worthy like everyone is preaching for but it is a fine job by ledger i really dont understand why fans are treating this like the second coming of christ or something calling it the best film ever a masterpiece the greatest super hero movie ever it should knock titanic of the top of the box office cause its a better movie its all a little premature if you ask me if degrading other movies or other actors to make this film look good is people best review of the dark knight then they are pretty closed minded the dark knight is a damn good action film nothing more nothing lessnegative,there were just too many subplots too much violence and it was at least a half hour too long they should have taken some of the time they spent planning cgi effects and used it to seal some of the plot holes 1 a witness pulls a gun out while hes on the witness stand excuse me this is some mythic land where the courthouses dont have metal detectors 2 theres a terrorist threat against a hospital so they evacuate every patient except the one whos been in all the papers 3 the police are transporting a high profile prisoner with dozens of vehicles escorting him and swat teams all over the place but one trailer truck starts chasing them and theyre all helpless 4 the silliest thing of all batmans constant whispering its supposed to make him sound menacing but he just sounds like he has laryngitis its like the old superman tv show where people magically have no idea who he is as long as he keeps his glasses on i know im way in the minority on this one but i have to say this was the ugliest stupidest movie ive ever seen i would have walked out if i werent trapped at the end of an aisle you couldnt pay me enough to sit through it againnegative,ok batman tdk is a good thriller worthing maybe a 7 out of 10 but is simply not conceivable that it is ranked more than masterpieces like the godfather and other wonderful pieces of art batman tdk is not a piece of art is just entertainment good entertainment even if the movie is a bit long the plot confused and sometimes non sense what about the logic of the ending mobile phone image scanningetc etc as other reviewers already commented the batman character voice is also pathetic with the forced laryngitis like tone do you want batman to talk like a 140 kg wrestling player nah those things may perhaps have impact on kids but look ridiculous to any other more mature audience heath ledgers performance is good in my opinion the best thing in this movie i liked his performance when the joker is coming out from the hospital before the explosion when he walked in a very strange psychotic way dressed like a nurse ahaha i liked his mimic i put 1 10 on this movie knowing that it deserves probably a 7 10 to reduce this insane over ratingnegative,how could this movie possibly have received so much acclaim ok its competently executed both in terms of acting and production values but then with the money spent on it hopefully that should be taken for granted and certainly it has some fine actors in it and they give every impression of fully believing in their work but what the heck is the point of it supposed to be im sorry but i just absolutely hated it it reminds me of a local case in the press here in toronto a while ago where some art student made a movie of a cat being tortured to death since he actually tortured a cat to death to make it he was charged and prosecuted and his defence was that it was art well at least all the people tortured and killed in this movie presumably were only faking it and werent actually hurt but i still dont think it has any more claim to be worthwhile or to be art its obnoxious rubbish and i strongly suggest that if you havent seen it and are considering doing so you think of some better use for your time which would be pretty much anything not actually harmful to your health or anybody elsesnegative,the red coats are coming the red coats are coming once again the english is trying to invade the land of the free imdb i apologize for not believing those who warned me of this movie people actually walked out i very much wanted to however i was with a friend he apparently wanted out as well being respectful of each other did not say anything till we discussed the movie which took about 2 seconds movie is hollow there is no beginning and most important there is no end batmans voice was annoying heath was okay especially with his disappearing trick oh yes one person clapped at the end i wanted to jump down and beat the hell out of him then realized he was slapping his head for it went numb for those who dont believe the negative ratings i want you to go watch itnegative,ledger gives a powerful performance as the joker but the rest of the movie was a bit out of focus surprisingly the movie revolves around harvey dent the white knight unfortunately eckhart was bland as harvey dent and his fall to the dark side was almost corny shame really as this was harvey dents story rather than batmans speaking of which i have never seen christian bale act this poorly the man is one of the greatest actors of his generation and now his performance was totally uninspired the batman voice is incredibly distracting and as bruce wayne he just sleepwalks through his scenes i also noticed that he wasnt as buff as he was in begins in all honesty there wasnt much for him to do here though the script simply doesnt give batman much to do other than fight and beat up people bruce wayne is the billionaire playboy and thats about it freeman and cain virtually play the same character they do it well but the cast is too bloated already so they dont get much screen time maggie gyllenhaal was great she was able to bring warmth to her portrayal of rachel dawes but unfortunately we dont get to see much of her either the philosophical themes in this movie are barely explored every hero turns into a villain or some such nonsense every firefighter will turn evil unless they die very shallow and laughable only jokers nihilistic speeches were convincing every good hearted person either dies or gets horribly mutilated and then turns to evil batman beats prisoners and brakes peoples legs why so violent then you have your boring action sequences the mandatory car chases and numerous explosions the dark knight is actually an action movie much like die hard only the nihilistic philosophy sets it apart and gives it a unique flavor if you are a big action movie fan youll probably enjoy this movie the dark knight isnt as good as batman begins batman begins was a character study how a traumatized young boy became a hero and how he turned his anger and fear into something positive here we see the hero corrupted by joker he is violent and angry no longer a hero he is willing to lie to the people of gotham because they couldnt handle the truth this sends a dubious message in fact this movie has way more propaganda than your average summer blockbuster invading privacy torturing prisoners and lying to the public but its cool cause its batman kids wanna be like batman and therefore batman is cool even while torturing prisoners dark knight could be viewed as legitimizing dick cheneys war on terror its pretty disgusting we have to work the dark side mr cheney said after 911 batman agrees negative,i gave this film a one just to pull down the overall  of the film it doesnt deserve the 10th place on top 250 list there is no way that this film deserves ten points heath ledger was great in his role as a joker no doubt about that his early departure from the land of the living makes his role stand out in many peoples minds and give a extra glitter to whole movie without joker this film would have much less ten point votes story really was bloated with too many characters most of them just showing their face in the movie without any significance to the main storyline scarecrow and batman boys or what they were called were totally unnecessary bypassers in the first half of the movie story was all over the place and it didnt have the consistency or the red line that it could follow many scenes were just boring and ridiculous this film really didnt give nothing good to the whole batman saganegative,how anyone can rate any one of these movies very high is perplexing this is like fodder for the middle american masses lengthy boring scenes of mediocre effects and dumb costumes the monkey suit takes the cake and sums up the whole mess terrible acting wow they found someone who is actually worse than harrison ford lucas using joesph cambell to lend credibility to this crap was a sin i wonder how much money was spent on joe to get him on the sw wagon ok so it is a harmless movie and some people apparently like it but come on better than american beauty or being john malkevich or spirits of the dead or any monty python movie etc etc etc oh well enjoy it negative,first the good things this people who made this movie really tried and put effort into what they were doing they get an a for effort maybe they tried too hard the good things about this movie come from the book the story the inspiration every good line every good scene what the movie brings to this story is not good it manages to make each chapter into a long drawn out mess its tiring to watch a super close up of some heroic figure speak a overly dramatic line delivered in some pseudo shakespearean delivery again and again watching elijah wood furrow his eyebrows for 2 hours almost drove me insane aragorn and his accent were to avoid exaggeration pretty annoying thanks to liv tyler for some super uninteresting words whatever they were something about love and forever yada yada yada that being said boromir and a few others had some memorable lines what passes for action is hyperbolic cgi silly costumes i loved seeing goblins prance around like broadway dancers and kung fu blockbuster style action scenes if you have scene any movie with swords and or fighting in it then youve seen this before if you like mtv video games or crack you will like this movie it is a triumph of using good books as an ingredient in the big movie formula you can rent this and spiderman 2 all in the same day then go download some britney spears pictures all entertaining for about 5 minutes if you are over 16 or you are looking for something interesting or new pass this by negative,i cant talk about the thousands or more positive aspects of this film when so many people are so overly optimistic about it and completely blind to its sometimes unacceptable flaws when i saw it i wanted to spit at the moviescreen its a truly great movie but there are so many stupid unnecessary faults and flaws preventing it from being perfect that you just gotta hate it doesnt people see the excessive use of cgi graphics making this film look like final fantasy dont you see that what you just think it looks cool wow look what they can do those special effects guys dont you realize no one will be impressed by the effex of this movie in 20 years those of you who havent read the books how can you like this at all as just a movie cuz it isnt even a movie its a really detailed animated synopsis of the books the three of them that is and not really accurate at that ever wondered where the drama went the depths of any scene or character the direction and exhibition if i can use that word of the parallel story lines or are you just revelling in the roller coaster ride feel to the film the cool effects weaponry and armour digital creatures the battle scenes and the heroic speeches with the typical romantic gaze of the eyes looking out over the horizon i actually usually enjoy the latter things but its just too much here and not good enough this really is true porn for the mid teenage rpg junkie and immature and nerdy men are you really that superficial cant you smell the melted plastic sure this truly is a gourm‹© dish all the more reason not to have any funny odeurs interfering with it this review wont be helpful to most of you of course cuz yall are probably like everybody else i just needed to spread my word get it off my chest peter jackson deserves all the respect he can get and the actors are really great and perfect for their roles but dont over do it this trilogy film is not the best movie ever made not a chance princess mononoke and spirited away each carry more depth than all three parts of lotr together its magnificent and overwhelming but not brilliant a film of this magnitude shoulnt leave anyone unsatisfied but it did at least with me cuz it didnt live up to its potential and it wasnt even better the the prior part so of course i was mad at it how couldnt i be how couldnt you be its like youre fanatical muslims or christians and this is the holy bible or coran you cant even question it or criticize it wake up negative,this movie sucks really hard how it beat lost in translation i will never know 11 oscars really even best song huh is that right acting good nah sean austin deserved the best supporting really cant be no oh good people are blinded by its bland cg effect ok gollum looked great but the battle scenes weak take off the blindfold and realize that it is not good i am sad that this movie is second highest grossing of all time yeah i know what your thinking i saw it and i saw the other two the fellowship of the ring was good but the this and the two towers stunk really bad naughty peter jackson naughty go sit in the cornernegative,this is in my opinion the most over rated film of all time sure there is some snappy dialogue here and there and tarantino has a good ear for music but none of this warrants the gushing praise heaped upon this movie nor the godlike status bestowed upon tarantino himself its over stylised over loud over acted sorry samuel tim john uma & bruce and the non linear narrative so favoured by the director simply doesnt work but its fashionable so its popular by the way this is one of the few films where ive actually seen people get up and walk out of the cinema before the end so i guess im not the only one who didnt like itnegative,so many high expectations which are all brought plummeting downward in the final episode of the saga first of all orlando bloom is gay he is one of the most pathetic actors i have ever watched secondly this movie is incredibly long and drawn out with nothing any more interesting then what is in the two towers finally it is very disappointing watching the poor acting coming from elijah wood and sean astin they have done better in movie such as north and encino man fortunately for the avid moviegoers there are some quality fantasy scifi movies that you can go see such as manos hands of fate and mortal kombat annihalation the only good thing about this movie iswait there are no good parts about this movie take this review serious because i am serious if you want to call me and talk to me about it call 1 805 423 6182 ask for chris or alexnegative,it will put you asleep because of how slow it moves now its not that i don not like 3 hours+ long movies i mean my favorite movie is once upon a time in america its just that lord of the ring the return of the king breaks the record for slowest moving movie half of the movie is just frodo and his friend sam trying to find some type of volcano to throw the ring and destroy it before gollum can get a hand on it the other half is just this big huge battle being fought now you expect a battle to give be action packed and give you an adrenaline rush but this movie does the complete opposite because of how slow it moves and how lame the few battles that are fought end it is a complete waist of time and you should only watch this movie if you have trouble sleeping at night because it will put you to sleep after the first few scenes i am still ashamed of the academy for giving this movie 11 oscars and i am still wondering how it did not win any razzie awards negative,i didnt grow up in the 70s and i understand that every movie belongs to its generation after watching this movie although i cant say i didnt enjoy it i am far from considering it best movie ever and certainly it is absolutely preposterous to make it #1 here first of all this movie is not for everyone it contains subject matter and scenes suitable for rather limited specific audiences second although glorification of crime in recent years especially by rap artists became a trend i dont think that values of this movie is exactly politically correct ‰ÛÒ making this movie `best of all times is equivalent to canonizing john gotti ‰ÛÒ ridiculous third as mentioned above this movie is just too vintage it is not how some people here imply  immortal  it is rather thematic and i would say monotone to the era it was made in i shall not further burden you with reasons although i have plenty of them contact me if you want to discuss this subject in detail nevertheless i will give it a rating of 1 10 because i think it is unfair to the other much greater works for this movie to be at this place negative,this movie continues to be praised but when i rented it i only made it through 45 minutes before i stopped the video there arent many movies that are so bad i dont watch the whole thing but the godfather is that bad i dont care how much other people may like it i still say it suckssuckssuckssuckssuckssuckssucks negative,blood and violence does not make up for horrible acting bad plot and ridiculous slap stick comedy it amazes me that so many brain dead americans found this movie enlightening i can not see why i originally saw pulp fiction in the theater and was thrown a back not because i was moved by its greatness but because i vomited all over the theater i recently gave it another shot and ended up vomiting all over my family room if any of you want to see a good movie that has great violence and great acting plot check out se7en or fight club or the boondock saints or the way of the gun i suggest to all stay away from quentin torrentino and check out movies written directed by david fincher or christopher mcquarrie they are two of the best movie makers that have appeared in the last 20 years torrentino is a hack who steals all his ideas from indy low budget 1970s films mostly crappy asian films and makes millions of dollars pawning his regurgitated crap back to his loyal if not brain dead fan base negative,the lord of the rings the return of the king the review how is it that such worthless eyecandy with one traited characters and a predictable storyline make it into the top 250 has every female under 18 given it a ten its disgusting the dialogue is pure crap much of every question asked in the whole series is usually answered by listen to your heart  is frodo alive  listen to your heart  should i marry aragorn even though hes mortal  listen to your heart the movies special effects are good though the battle scenes leave no suspense and are only fun to watch i truely didnt care for any of the characters aragorn as a brave noble warrior blah gimli as the comic relief wtf legolas as the cute archer yuck gandalf as the wise wizard dear god saramon as the greedy evil wizard pfft frodo as the innocent caring victim originality people etc who cares what bugs me the most is that this overrated garbage is actually in the top ten of the top 250 in front of pulp fiction citizen kane casablanca seven samaraui forgive my spelling 2001 a space oddesseythe list goes on its sickening summary the lotr the return of the king is overrated nothing more then eyecandy overall grade 1 10 40 negative,pulp fiction panders to base behaviorthe filth of the languagesubject matterincluding sodomysickening drug use & the flippancy of the hit men is not amusingthis movie is one of the worst pieces of trash ever pawned off as artglorification of this movie illuminates the level of moral turpitude that permeates throughout american society & hollywood in particularnegative,it was good for its time yeah sure but do you really still think it deserves #1 of all time i just think there are better films out there ones with more action suspensespecial effects i know it was low budgetactors etc there just seemed to be more dialogue than anything else in the film put together if you showed this to the younger generation then they would simply not be impressed there are bigger titles out now and why is everyone still voting this in it would be much better to vote the lord of the rings trilogy in the top 3 or put the shaw shank redemption at #1 that would make more sense i would personally put the godfather at #5 seeing as it does have the best title for a film of all time negative,i did what many listed here have done and rented it against my better judgement since the previews had done little to entice me as objective as an analysis goes heres my 002$ positives 1 the movie is original 2 the way the multiple stories intersect is probably the high point 3 it contains seasoned actors that perform the role as well as can be expected 4 i did smile during the door shooting scene with travolta & jackson and few others humours one liners conversations negatives i there is way too much foul language is it possible to let the clock tick with hearing an f word i can even commend times it should be used to underline emphasize etc but every 45 seconds ii individually some stories might have become interesting but by just skimming on the better ones bruce willis and digging deeper in the blander ones travoltasand the dude bagged in the car = you come away with a yeah so what lingering in your mind iii a few original lines and skewed timeline doesnt a movie make one has the sense of a hyped up boxing match where the champ get cut in the 1st minute of the 1st round thus ruled a no contest i can see it appealing to some mtv type crowd or some that desperately cr ave something original which it is but gives me nothing to digest once over vs something one can really connect and sink his teeth into like the shawshank redemption gattaca american beauty that one is a rose by any other name and it certainly doesnt deserve to be in the top100 of all times enjoy the show folks jerome m negative,one reviewer wrote [my father] spent wwii fighting in the pacific john tolkien had spent wwii warm and cozy in oxford writing drivel um excuse me but you do know that tolkien fought in the first world war indeed it was around that time that he started writing his mythology right i guess not otherwise you wouldnt have written such a silly uninformed comment as for the book being sexist and racist thats purely a matter of interpretation certainly not shared by all the whole complaint about there being no people of color in the lord of the rings is anyway a weak one tolkien created lord of the rings as part of a greater mythology which he intended to be his vision of english myth since nothing substantial was in existence in that regard england is indigenously white as far as i am aware thus all the characters in the silmarillion and lotr are white let me put my point in the form of a question are there white people in african asian or south american myths no there are not thus its unfair to criticize the fact of an all white cast in tolkiens mythology yes i am aware of the easterlings in the book who are described as swarthy and of the fact that they are in league with the dark lord but swarthy does not necessarily mean black and their being both swarthy and bad has more to do with the fact of their geographical occurrence and the fact that they are men it wasnt only the swarthy people who were in cahoots with the dark lord negative,even do i think this film is highly enjoyable i will rate it with only one star this is due to the fact that i think its position at the imdb top 250 is really unfair there are many movies that surpass this one in many aspects and they should be above this title i dont exactly know how the system works since the only votes that count are the ones from regular voters when do you become one but i will try to lower its position rating this film with only one star even do i think it deserves 6 or 7 the performances are truly above average but i think that the characters are not near as memorable on the other hand i liked the photography a lot and the story is really good but i think the movie should have ended about 10 minutes before like no country for old men i wrote this comment only to encourage people to do the same thing i am glad to see comments like mine which makes me thing that not everybody consider this title as the best movie ever because it is not i know it is a matter of subjectivity but when too many people give this film 10 stars we are denying that there are better films out therenegative,it is neat to believe in your heart that you are hip and if you can obtain coolness by watching a movie wow i believe that everybody who says they like pulp fiction thinks they are cool they think that a movie with such style and witty banter is only for the hip the only problem is that this film is as empty as a scottish pay toilet and perhaps the most pretensious piece of nothing ever if you have not figured it out yet there is no story here tarantino simply shoots a pointless movie and then breaks it up so that we do not see it in its proper sequence so things that happen last come before things that finished before and vice versa you start to wonder gee am i not intelligent enough to follow this then you realize uhhh no it is actually fairly simple he is just stringing a bunch of scenes along in no particular order then he gives unrealistic and long winded speeches to characters that are not particularly realistic it does not make the film really bad but at the same time it does not make it good either you can paint a piece of crap all kinds of different colors but it is still a piece of crap i wonder if tarantino has the talent to actually tell a real story without having to resort to fancy tricks shocking scenes and other gimmicky tricks i doubt it oh well i guess i am just not that cool i mean samuel jackson sure did say some funny thingsnegative,there are only three movies which i have rented that i refused to watch from beginning to end one is natural born killers another is blazing saddles and the third is this piece of trash pulp fiction which of the three is worse i cant say for sure suffice it to say however that anyone that has the stomach to sit through this jumbled nonsensical celloid wasteland of obscenity violence lasciviousness drug abuse immorality and thuggery ought to get a quick reality check before all is lost if there is a hell it is being forced to watch this movie over and over again not only is it horrid to watch but it makes not an ounce of sensenegative,first of all my comment doesnt have spoilers because there is absolutely nothing to spoil i intended to watch pulp fiction & reservoir dogs after i seen kill bill vol 1 & 2 which i really liked because of the same director quentin tarantino he became my favourite director after i seen kill bill vol 1 & 2 but no longer when i seen pulp fiction it has all the possible bad things in a film and the list is endless there is nothing but drug use and swearing that made my ears bleed the f word was repeated more times than the number of heartbeats of a persons lifetime none of the stories were appealingin fact i just dont know whats going on because there was no structure or plot the film was about 25 hours and i hated every second it was extremely boring that i had a sore head & i felt like ripping my arm out and constantly bash my head with it anyway i can go on forever i just dont know why its #5 on the imdb top 250 maybe because mostly people have accidentally clicked on 10 instead of 1 out of 10 quentin tarantino must have pulled the script from his bum and was running about in a circle with it then his wife must of hit him on the head with a rolling pin and said you promised me no more rubbish films he must of found a brain in a fruit bowl before he made kill bill he also looks like a idiot and talks like a girl now i dont intend to watch reservoir dogs crap fiction is now definitely on my top 5 worst films of all time and is in second place first is either jackass the movie 1 or 2 it is critically acclaimed because 97% of critics have no brains and the rest of the 3% have cheated in their exams that is why they always give good reviews to bad films and bad reviews to good films overall no matter what ever happens there will never be a worse film than crap fiction any movie in the imdb bottom 100 is better and i would like to salute anyone who has given it a 1 out of 10 this whole comment is only 1% expression of hate to this stupid crap junk garbage & good for nothing film negative,i saw this in the theater with my girlfriend because she had seen it with some friends and said it was so good i made it through the whole thing somehow and as we were walking through the parking lot i just started thinking that this movie has sucked over 2 hours of life from me and ill never get it back i honestly felt dumber for watching the whole thing there is nothing good about this movie except a couple of members of the cast not travolta nor thurman and their ability was limited due to the awful script there is nothing groundbreaking about this movie the dialog is boring the characters have no depth it seems like it was made on a 24 hour deadline and they had plenty of spare time to go back and add an f word anywhere there was a space i wouldnt have cared less if tarantino had had another character that built an atomic bomb that accidentally detonated and wiped out everyone in this collection of trash this is by far one of the worst movies i have ever seen especially for something so highly praised negative,peter jackson has successfully completed his evisceration of the lord of the rings by removing the heart of tolkiens the return of the king leaving it void of humanity or pathos jackson continues his confusing and odd choices in this film revealing no confidence in the source material relying instead on more comfortable hollywood clich‹©s and tired camera setups which are augemented by the playstation effects that younger audience members have come to expect and which leave others hungry for the versimilitude of tolkiens mamoth and respected at least by some work to paraphrase a touchstone phrase from the 60s `frodos dead and peter jackson killed himnegative,a film about post war us life maybe i was tired while watching it but anyway i was disappointed nothing more than gangster movie at all marlon brando is excellent though i`m not going to say that it`s chicken feed but from my point view it has artificially created reputation la piovra italian tv series is much better in every pointnegative,i really dont understand people sometimes here we have the #1 rated movie on the list an extremely famous film a well made film in its own right but the story its awful this is a story about a man how starts off as a fine upstanding citizen a soldier no less and his gradual change into what i can only describe as a total st i really did not like this movie i did like it up to a pointonce i realized that michael was not going to overcome his demons i really dont feel i should waste any more time on this film so i wontnegative,i feel like im on another planet when i hear people talk about this movie it is probably the worst movie that i have ever seen its only rivals are the two previous lor movies was there some weird subliminal suggestion that im immune to were they serving some drugged cool aid that i missednegative,if heath ledger deserved an oscar for this then why didnt mickey rourke win one for sin city simple answer is sin city is a film based on a comic book whereas the dark knight is some kind of post 9 11 view of the world in which terrorists like osama oledgers character go around blowing up buildings and sending the police and the worlds media videos or virals or what ever the hell those crappy scenes are supposed to represent in order to instill fear and panic nice one nolan for ruining a comic book fantasy by trying to be stanley kubrick or whoever the hell you were trying to be with this movie and i am getting fed up with people saying this is how batman should be represented just read the comic books wheres robin how the hell are they going to write the penguin or cat woman into the story it was okay with the joker because they just stole the look of james obars the crow and attached it to a caricature of certain terrorists that in the last 10 years have caused death and destruction and let a film go out to the worlds media every now and then just like the joker in this film to let everyone know there still around i cant even describe how pretentious this piece of cp is it was okay with batman begins but with this it seems as if nolans made a serious political statement while using the guise of a comic book that was written in the 1930s personally i think the first batman film despite its many flaws is still the only true representation of batman from gotham city to the noir aspects and even the characters heath ledgers joker is in no way comparable to the joker character bob kane created and the way he played the joker was just irritating i just wanted to punch him out i found him not in the least bit scary or intimidating he just needed a good punch to the throat if you want to check out some good performances of lunatics check out dennis hopper in blue velvet rutger hauer in the hitcher or gary oldman in leon who also happens to be the only good thing about this film christian bale is just cp as bruce wayne and batman like he was the last time and like he is in every other movie he has made with the exception of american psycho in which he played a tt basically just had to turn up to set and be himself but just like the godfather this is just going to be another over hyped piece of garbage that people rave on about for the next thousand years or until some other film maker makes another batman film where he is this time played by a woman in space on a space station fighting genghis khan because this is how far these movies are moving away from the source material this very film is based on the film is disgusting to look at as well at least burton and schumachers gotham citys looked original and yes i know he put the statue of liberty into batman forever but this film is just garbage and not just like new york they might as well as called this film heat as well seeing as it has so many shots of tall buildings in fact i might just go watch heat as it is a better made film without a pretentious plot and decent actors with a good script with well thought out direction and alarmingly a faster pace then this turgid piece of excrement if you want my advice watch batman 1 then heat and then turn on the news after that and you will pretty much get the gist of the dark knight but in a more enjoyable way and wont have to sit through this demoralising piece of rubbish if you happen to be below the age of thirteen or just a geek who cant get a girlfriend or boyfriend then you will probably think this film rules personally i think it is cpnegative, i wouldnt say this is a bad movie its still good entertainment compared to other 21th centuries block busters that fail in every possible way but it has nothing to do in the top 250 sorry imdb kids who know nothing about cinema took over your ranking system the main grudges id have about this movie would be 1 it is way too long itd been a while since i last experienced the feeling of expecting the credits to begin each time a scene would end i was like ok then the end and the movie would keep going into some nuke the fridge like action scene that has nothing to do with the main plot as if the directors told themselves people paying money to go to the theater want to have bang for their bucks so lets give them 56 explosions 87 wrecked cars and 77 dead guys fictive count but you get the idea toward the end i was completely out of the movie focusing on not peeing in my pants 2 whats with 2 face i didnt know about 2 face making an appearance in this episode i thought it was all about the jocker vs the world boy i was surprised to see this coming straight out of nowhere right in the middle of the movie but hey at that time i thought nice way to introduce 2 face could it be the next batman they make will have him as the main villain so i was kinda expecting a the end screen when say the jocker sets him free from the hospital so that the movie is still coherent with the others like ok this time batman half won the jocker is introduced as its arch ennemy and theres another freak out there to spice it up the end to be continued but the movies keeps going and going and going and going although its a totally different story its as if they packed 2 movies in 1 seriously they should have called it batman vs the jocker featuring 1 extra villain of course theres also the 2 face is dead thing when we all know hes coming back a few episodes later i cant understand why they made it that way it would have been so much easier to have for example the 2 of them drop into water and only have batman to reach the shore leaving a question mark over 2 faces fate completely clich‹© sure but at least theyre not killing someone to have him reappear in a sequel oh hold on maybe batman and gordon and all the cops cant tell the difference between a corpse and a living fellow i could go on forever on all the flaws like _ cell phone crap yeaaaah right ok its batman but still and like 1 guy alone could trace millions in real time _ stupid prisoners dilemma in the boats since when criminals have morals _ i burn money cause i dont care but i rob banks stance of the joker _ the batcave is now located in an almost empty room in the docks _ alfred burns his masters letters come on why so serious alfred _ batman is strong with men but weak with dogs where is the batkick at _ batmans awful voice puberty at 35 between begins and tdk _ the joker has no plan but everything goes as planned every time _ the batpunch carpets big fellas but the jocker can handle it no problem _ crime syndicates give away their money to keep to some chinese guy nobody knows trusting him to keep it safe since when criminals trust each other over money concerns _ gotham changed a lot between 2 episodes and on and on i repeat this is not a bad movie itself its just way overrated its just another action movie that you go see to put your brain on low power mode for a couple of hours i would have put a 5 or 6 on it but we need to counterbalance the tens that cinema uneducated dumb kids put negative,what a let down all this talk has talked up the movie and the only relationship with the reality of the movie is that in it theres way too much talking loads of earnest blah blah from the joker too and comically in a very throaty fashion from christian bale this would be an extremely rare misfire if hed had anything enough to do to actually affect its outcome batman is a characterless suit with a sore throat while the joker is a nutter unsurprisingly batman begins was a good film easily the best of the batman bunch this one is just a normal movie made kind of laughable by the corny dialog blah blah suit blah make up blah explosion blah suit make up blah explosion blah blah blahnegative,this is the worst film ever to be made because its crp and it aint ready for the godfather all you re teachers understand that so all you re teachers be quiet before you get shanked 1the godfather 2the godfather pt 2 3inception shank redemption is worse then toy story the whole collection it is even worser than super babies to be honest with you dont worry it will soon be taken out of the number one slot by christopher nolan frank darabont is so sht at directing films he is worser then david yates im gonna make shank redemption an offer the film cant refruse the offernegative, over long boring tedious over acted and very very very very very over rated hell knows what goes through the minds of people to vote this the 2nd best film ever i first saw the cut down version lasting 1 hour 25 minutes and it was still too long i wouldnt mind but its so drawn out fanciful and pathetic the things that happen in that prison would never happen just because some nerdy bank manager has hope give me a break which soap opera did that sad line come from no wonder it was initially ignored and it should be continued to be ignored robbins who is accused and wrongly convicted for the murders of his wife and her lover never ages at one point he has to remind us hes been in jail for 12 years because it only looks like a week yet did you see the way he really changed in 12 years from 1994 to 2006 he looks a much older man and of course he does hes 12 years older in the shamshank dedeption he never aged one day in 12 years and his hair is even cut the same style even when we then go forward something like 20 years he still looks the same never aged at all apart from a few bluey grey hairs at the sides and after he escapes after 20 years of tunnelling through thick concrete with a a small screwdriver he meets up with his old buddy freeman who got out of jail legally and get this both look younger than when they first went in by my reckoning tim robbins should now be about 70 and morgan freeman in his early 80s yet both after serving their time still look barely 40 and what a load of talkative rubbish the most boring over hyped up film in history complete twaddle god knows how on earth i watched all of it but i did if for a bet cause i cannot stand it wasnt worth a uk tenner anyway my vote 2 out of 10 for a mediocre drama get a life if this is the best film youve even seen better still get a cinema ticket or rent a dvd and more than one negative,another one of those overlong morally right on movies that never rises above average saved only by the acting its bleeding heart politics dignity of individual maintained in adverse conditions is played out well enough but actually lacks any real dramatic tension dufrane is a two dimensional character who seems to go through the drama by numbers theres never any doubt that he will triumph in the end its only a matter of how tim robbins has done many more interesting films than this one try the player or bob roberts if youre looking for drama moral ambivalence and how they interact basically there are a lot better prison films than this one jailhouse rock for starters like most stephen king stories quite prosaic there was a story in here somewhere but it got over inflated and somewhat lost along the way one to watch on a rainy day when theres nothing better to donegative,sorry folks but this movie is a c movie and not an a i cant believe that people like this movie so much yes i am biased i really dont like tim robbins but he has made a decent movie or two but this aint one of them this is your basic prison movie what can i say it has the host of usual characters the storyline is basic the outcome i wont say but it is just stupid to say that this is a great movie i didnt think it was realistic at all and anybody who falls for this crap is either delusional or needs some brains to differentiate between an edsel and a lamborghini i wouldnt watch this movie again unless i was paid to do so one viewing is enough for this predictable laughernegative,i am a hardcore movie buff ive seen them all and studied them all of all the movies said to be the greatest of all time or a contender of one of the greatest of recent times this is the most undeserving do i really think that this is a 1 10 no i ranked it this low hoping 90 rating would eventually drop because 9 10 on this site in 4th place many other sites with this ranked either at the top or near the top what the hell i will say that this was well made the cinematography action and danger sequences were well done but not as good as say die hard heath ledgers performance as the joker is what carries the movie and is the nay reason why it is ranked so high without heath ledger as the joker the movie would have been as dull as the dark knight rises ledger gives one of the best performances in recent memory but people treat it like its better than de niro in raging bull or kevin spacey in american beauty because of him they also treat it like its up to par with the likes of schindlers list and shawshank redemption i gather those people have never seen either one because both those movies blow the dark knight out of the water what it my problem with this its concept is stupid citizens of gotham blame all crime on batman and bruce wayne agrees he thinks gothams true hero is da harvey dent dent may be waynes buddy he even he knows its bogus as the joker rises and spreads chaos batman is still treated like a villain and bruce just takes it what a dumb ass and thats what goes on throughout the whole movie you are responsible for all crime batman  open your eyes cant you see its the joker that doing all this youre welcome for me protecting you next time ill just let the joker kill you guys and let harvey dent save you i can see why they would label harvey dent as a hero but can he really save people from a burning building or falling off a cliff no thats what batman is for the movie is very slow practically getting nowhere and the character development isnt very strong the characters are developed into stunned pushovers good action the joker and two face were the only reasons this movie was worth watching joker and two face harvey dent where the only good characters in this it baffles me how high people can rate and praise such a generic movie the must not know how ratings work do they know who robert de niro is have they heard of steven spielberg have they seen gone with the wind maybe this movie isnt as bad as i said but it is so overrated i get sick of it easily and strongly believe it does not deserve the praise it gets negative,the dark knight is one of the worst films i have ever seen ive disliked most of christopher nolans prior work but was willing to be converted and the rave reviews psyched me up drained of humor even black plot less structurally inept poorly shot one third of the movie coming across as a pierce brosnan bond movie bale even goes into bond autopilot without noticing nolan hasnt a clue how to make pictures or what makes humans tick and i wish the undeserved hype around him as a director ended now ledger is dreadful but the poor chaps role is so wretchedly written that his character never stands a chance not to mention nolans amateurish decision to make ledger copy vincent prices thriller voice undermining any authority the character is supposed to have by attempting to ground the batman mythology in contemporary reality it just comes across as plain silly nolan makes films for technology age emotionless drudges hiding their lack of self esteem and identity crises behind a mask of hipness and faux aggression by going to see the dark knight nolan is dictating to them that they are cool and superior that the film is a horrible poorly made highly manipulative piece of work is irrelevant negative,first and for most the movie was far too long there was no reason for it to be 3 hours and 21 mins much of the film could have been edited and it would have still had the same effectas for all the people who felt the length was good or wish it had been longer buy the dvd and watch the deleted scenses second to much of the film was way to unrealistic even in a place like middle earth im not going to go into any detail on this because some people may not have seen the film but take note also many of the things which could have made this an exciting film were cut short such as the dealings with the witch king besides some great special effects and nice cinematography the film was a huge disappointment in conclusion i am left with a few question how did so many people trick themselves into liking this moive and how did it get to number 3 on the users choice poll negative,omg heath got depressed because of playing this silly lunatic joker is emanation of evil the dark knight is no4 on imdb list please this is typical and so average action flick with really stellar cast most of my favorite actors are here caine bale oldman and some other i usually enjoy watching freeman eckhart gyllenhaal but it was all in vain because at first place i like movies with message or those thatll make you think fe figt club dogville american beauty and if theres no message or possibility of insight i like to be entertained fe noises off corpse bride the curse of the black pearl even st trinians and mamma mia although shallow and naive they make you smile sing dance but this one 1 message ‰ÛÒ none this movie wont make you think about your life wont change your point of view wont make you a better person wont even make you think at all 2 fun ‰ÛÒ a lot if you like violence blowing things up fire killing otherwise none too long boring shallow no dialogs no humor nothing thank god ive waited for dvd so i could use fast forward ill give it 5 10 in my notebook but just 1 here because its waaaay overrated negative,now i know rating a film awful is a bit much but calling this film a master piece and smashing the 10 out of 10 down is also a bit extreme the critics may like this film but seeing as ive read the source material i can see theres much more interesting and subtle ways to handle the films message the message of the film is in your face and i guarantee its contradictory to itself if you pay attention to the film the joker is an interesting character ill give heath that but he seems a bit all too knowing almost always reading peoples actions before they do it themselves that is a bit problematic when nolan is labeling his film to be realistic anyway the jokers plans are too well thought out and constructed to be considered chaotic or anarchic theres always a strict sense of structure in his chaos this along with the actions of other characters make the film seem like its preaching a message because everyone shows up and does a special part and then disappears including the man himself batman so its not a real life situation cause and effect the social experiment so to put it is done in an unbelievable way and when you see it youll know what im talking about if nolan is trying to comment on society he should at least do it right the performances are good especially ledger and oldman however bale needs to be directed a little different when performing his batman voice the rest of the movie lacks style and becomes boring a blue filter doesnt make up for good old fashioned symbolic imagery also there are several things changed from the comics that inspired this film and i can say the change is for the worse each time without the performances this film would just be a heat copycat negative,because of the advance publicity a few posters and an all star lineup of actors we planned to see pulp fiction as soon as it came out i took my sister to see this movie on opening day in college station tx the theater charged premium rates for the show the two tickets cost me $70 what a mistake it was so boring that we walked out after approximately 30 minutes and went for drinks instead the only redeeming point to the evening was that i only wasted 30 minutes and $70 i can at least cling to not having wasted several hours this movie ignore the comments made by people who want to pretend they didnt get taken save your cash and see something entertaining negative,i saw this movie when it was just past its prime at a dollar theater and boy was i ripped off this is absolutely the worst movie i have ever seen it along with fargo and natural born killers are my top 3 worst films i have no problem with films that are quirky but this film made absolutely no sense to me sometimes i will give a film a second chance and watch it again thinking maybe it was just my mood on that particular day but i would never waste my time on this movie againnegative,well the lord of the rings trilogy seems to be a cheap action movie which hasnt much common with the great book from tolkin the return of the king has some nice battle scenes but its just another action movie with mostly good special effects many good parts of the original book where totally twisted mixed or deleted with not much sense and some very stupid parts are just invented from peter jackson to show more of this not so impressive orlando blum its good that tolkin cant see this movie i just hope it makes him not spinning in his grave my hint to peter jackson stay at your roots and make more splatter movies like braindead negative,people do not understand cinema i see the movie the fighter with top stars and sure it gets oscars or the godfather oh ya great movie i just watched a movie called rockaway 2007 a movie where the main actor is just a normal man and yes he acts normal and looks normal but the power that can come from a normal man explodes in this movie rockaway the people who rate the fighter or the godfather with high ratings or liked it any are people with a low iq they probably like these types of movies because cuz they like crime like the godfather the godfather is trash this little dude in rockaway 2007 this movie mostly uses intelligence to take down the mob and its godfather i cannot stand the movie the godfather because america is praising crime and gangsters this movie shows how one mans determination to stop a gang of thugs is expelled mostly with intelligence training determination and more i cannot stand the oscar and academy award panel they do not know how to judge films i will sing to everything good when the day comes and people stop admiring trash like the fighter and the godfather i get a kick out of the movie rockaway because the character can be a good role model he is not a criminal drug addict and he isnt stupid when we watch the fighter or the godfather you see top american actors committing crime drugs and utter stupidity but in rockaway a regular american or hispanic not sure man comes back to town to take down the entire russian mob he even takes down the godfather of the mob while he is blind after his eyes were taken out i am thankful that i am not stupid enough to be excited when the bad guys mobsters win i am the type of guy that likes to go to work without the mafia trying to get in my way mobs and gangsters and their movies just dont excite me but seeing this high rating helps me to understand why there is so much crime in america and why most people are too scared to go outside hahanegative,i dont why people had ranked this movie so high but there is nothing in this movie which is good expect john and jackman samuels actingthis is slowest movie i have ever seen the parts like start with boss wife is not needed when i have seen rating of this movie i was really exited to see it i bought the movie cd when i stated watching movie is good at start it attracts mine interest but after the two stories the third seems much boring and after that the others are also boring and does not make any sense i thought that there will be any suspense in the last part but what i thought was crap so movie is much much below mine expectationsnegative,well if you think this movie was better than se7en fight club matrixpsycho etc then you must have cinemathis movie is a good action movie but has literally nothint in it worth paying attention the clown is none spookier than a spider your little sister thats right pssy already squashed and most of the characters dont know what they talk about joker wants to create havoc using paranoiac scyzophrenics which would be the equivalent of trying to chop a sequoia with a rotten salmon since paranoiac schyzophrencs dont know the difference between reality guns banks etc two face is just useless and the movie has no message whatsoever even the joker doesnt know the difference between chaos and anarchy i could go on and on about the stupidity manifested in this film but if you dont care about your own why would you not vote an unworthy film to be the 6th best film wont know where it will be when you read it but hope that it descends to at least 500th place like this shame on you but if you hate cinema you just have to follown the work of adam sandler ps go back to playing lego kid negative,i read a while back that the godfather was a favorite book of an author i enjoy i hence picked up a copy and was enthralled i had heard how great the movie was so i watched it and i was appalled i grant you the movie follows the book closely but it doesnt understand what makes the book work most of the actors know what to do and al pacino is perfect but marlon brando is clueless vito corleone is not a thinly veiled thug he is a caring man who is forced to do some horrible things but in the end he accomplishes far more good than evil this only makes micheals transformation in the book more horrible because the deaths he commits serve no such higher purpose also scenes of great importance are removed johnny fontane is barely in it santinos girlfriend has a cameo and the doctor is nowhere to be found i know these characters dont directly effect the plot but they give it an emotional foundation to build upon i cared about them more than any of the other characters i know coppola had to cut the book down for time to do a movie but he would have been better off doing a mini series instead negative,ok i really dont care what anyone says about this film this movie stinks in all areas there is bad acting bad directing bad plot and absolutely and i mean absolutely no action to speak of and some of the silliest characters i have ever seen i could picture the real mafia laughing their head off at this lame attempt as far as mafia movies go this is definitely the britney spears and backstreet boys of mafia movies its so pop culture its laughable al pacino and company are terribly overwhelmed they are not talented enough to cover mafia movies there are so many better ones ive seen from the 50s and 60s not to mention a modern one like goodfellas the godfather truly stinks to high heavennegative,this movie totally sucks to infinite and beyondhow the hell is it good its total crap low budget crap actors al pacino sucks marlon brando sucks no violence no gore crap story without a doubt the worst movie i have ever seen the best part is the end of this piece of crap franciss ford coopla should be ashemed of himself for this boringlow budget piece of crap how is it number 1 whats so good about it its pure sit should be number 1 at the worst movie ever made the ultra cruel horses head in the bed scene al pacinos crap acting no guns no violence no nudity christ mario puzo should be ashamed of of himself for this garbage its nowhere near as bad as goodfellas which was crap from beginning to end i hate martin se and stupid francis ford coopla they couldnt even make porn look good stick right away from this rubbishnegative,i fail to see how people are actually taking this movie seriously batman is meant to be an enjoyable superhero comic book blockbuster but that is all the film makers feeble attempt to make things more serious by throwing in the cringing ferry and solar phone tap scene were embarrassingly unnecessary and came off as patronising to the audience furthermore the use of real ny style sky scrapers for gotham city in some far from subtle way of making more 9 11 america comparisons ruined the distorted and macabre atmosphere of gotham city that tim burton had translated so well onto screen the fictional comic book edge was further lost by showing us the jokers violent followers from behind to expose their masks while all this might have made the movie fresher and more realistic why keep the entirely unbelievable and cackling joker character instead heath ledgers excellent performance feels out of place with the rest of the movie and while heath did play the joker very well it is not exactly difficult to play a cartoon fictional and face painted psycho if you want to see a real oscar winning performance of a psychopath watch monster 2006 if he gets the oscar sympathy vote for this i would have no more respect for the academy and its flawed voting processnegative,just like the joker i am also a little curious about the primitive nature of human beings in our society not that im immune myself but it always amazes me to see the exponential effect of hype to watch humans horde into a frenzy of blissful ignorance let me make myself clear heath ledgers performance alone is worth the ticket price to see this movie he is stunning and he destroys jack nicholsons performance and i say this knowing that i had previously thought no one can do joker as good as jack nicholson but joker is only a third of this movie and a shame in hindsight the rest of this film is a just mish mash of tension pace plot and action 1 christopher nolan struggles with action scenes they are confusing chaotic and illogical which culminates into an underwhelming visceral and cerebral experience somewhat boring 2 batman is a lifeless and dull character in batman begins this was ok because he was mostly swinging from the corner of the screen like a predator but given a more open role batman in a cape was distracting his metamorphosis as batman was absorbing to experience in the first film but the conflicts he faces in this sequel pale in comparison batman is too sensitive and too poetic in his choice of resolutions ready to reveal his identity too quickly and ready to become a dark knight based on the pompous premise dent must remain the white light 3 two face is an oddball an oddball of creation of reaction and of evolution his arch is a forced effort by nolan it doesnt make sense for him to kill gordons family dent himself commented that he knew his job was dangerous he knew that there were bad people after him why the sudden transformation when this happened the transformation of two face was based on the premise of his philosophical awakening that to believe in chance is to believe in chaos but i cant believe this would cause such an explosive change in him willing to kill a child it doesnt make sense two face as caricature was not near as engaging or entertaining 4 the pacing of this film is poor there are moments where it is too fast and moments where the film is too slow effectively i think the movie should have ended sooner it dragged out and i was mostly non responsive to the conclusion of two face 5 ultimately for a movie to be amazing one must come out of a cinema and be amazed i didnt like the movie in its entirety and i truly believe that had heath ledger not been involved in dark knight the general consensus would have been a lot different and the flaws a lot more glaringly obvious this was a 25 hour movie in which everything but joker was underwhelming it was a good movie but given the hype its now everyones favorite film of all time as the imdb ratings might soon suggestnegative,wow cant believe how high the rating is for this film on imdb did we all see the same film wow okay just got back from seeing this and i gotta say i was very very disappointed overall the movie had its moments but maaaan oh maaaan was this movie way too long and unnecessarily so so far christian bale has proved to be a satisfying batman but no one has lived up to my vision of what batman should truly be up on the big screen that said lets move on the viewing experience the worse part about this movie for me was the editing it was unforgivably choppy too many scenes ended too abruptly and i guess a whole lot of stuff happened off camera because there were a considerable amount of gaping plot holes the action very intense from the beginning which was great but the movie peetered out toward the end that whole scene with harvey dent holding gordons family hostage was just way too long and too over the top dents transformation into evil happened too quickly which made his descent into bat villain unconvincing it was like he was having a very bad tantrum thats all he needed to be spanked or hugged nope despite what you may read there wasnt anything poetic about it sorry freudians coolest scenes i really liked the confrontation scene at the jail between batman and the joker great great stuff batman was extremely close to losin it and i thought for a second he just may kill him he just might snap and do it but nah batman isnt nearly as amoral as ol clown face another scene i liked was when batman was in hong kong kickin some baddies asses then he grabs the head honcho asian dudecant remember his name sorry launches some balloon thingy in the sky hooks himself and the baddie to an oncoming plane which of course was all arrangedi wonder who was flying the thing lucius which takes off into the night sky that scene was tight executed brilliantly most memorable scenes the joker making that pencil disappear the joker walking away in a nurses uniform as bombs go off behind him classic those images will stay with me for a long long time coolest toy the batpod geeks will cheer performances heath ledger was good yes did he give me chills and simply blow me away sadly no but perhaps i was expecting way too much after all the buzz on his performance as the joker started way back in january does he deserve a posthumous oscar no an oscar nomination should more than suffice for the kudos hes been getting his death is what has swayed or rather manipulated people to say this is the most incredible performance ever seen on screen dont be so gullible its a good performance dont get me wrong but its not history making however heath now makes nicholsons joker look as campy and as ridiculous as cesar romero christian bale had his moments so did aaron eckhart gary oldman is always a pleasure to watch morgan freeman and michael caine will always be veterans of their craft everyone else could have phoned it in the music not memorable and in some scenes shrill and annoying where or where is danny elfman what bugged me the most batmans gravelly and super loud voice it sounded completely ridiculous and over amplified not menacing just ridiculous i thought the script tried too hard to send a message what we got was sophomoric rhetoric which was overly preachy the ending a dud even though the movie was an agonizing 25 hours i still felt something was missing batman being hunted down by gordon and the gcpd was lame the nolan brothers shouldve written a much more satisfying ending i felt cheated there was not enough of a satisfying denouement for the joker he was just left hanging there upside down giggling like a school girl on crack they shouldve given the joker a much more satisfying final scene like that last shot of anthony perkins in psycho staring chillingly into the camera jokers exit should have been just as memorable and just as scary what they gave us was weak pure and simple and that really really sucks since it was indeed heaths final scene his final image up on the big screen doing what he loved the most they couldve given him a better tribute than that what id like to have seen the joker being funny come on people thats what the joker has always been about not campy but funny heaths interpretation of the joker was nothing like in the comics i understand the nolan brothers wanting to be dark and all that but lets get real and stick to story origins okay the joker is a demented psychopath yes but hes also supposed to be wickedly funny you know laughing at his own sick twisted humor we got none of that from heaths portrayal what he played was a character who shouldve been named the sicko or the money burner or chaos man in any case the nolan brothers to me failed to give us the joker we all really wanted to see again i liked heaths performance i did but there was still so much missing overall review i was entertained by this film but was sadly disappointed with the pacing the editing and some of the gaping plot holes and what sucks is that im a huge batman fan huge i soooo wanted this film to be a masterpiece but it wasnt not by a longshot i actually gave this movie a 6 out of 10 stars but most of you made this movies rating on imdb just unforgivably too high negative,good cinematography and special effects makes a perfect movie well according to most people i guess so but for people like me unfortunately there arent too many of us individual minded thinkers left it takes a good story to lure us in to me this movie tried noticeably hard to pack everything together and failed of course unless good cinematography and special effects gives you a hard on a way overdone story with an unrealistic genius villain loaded with shattering glass and more shattering glass is what i got out of it one thing after another made me feel like i was watching batman the law & order miniseries oh yeah for one of the best if not the best movie of all time this thing didnt leave me in awe for a second or raise the hair on my arm one bit like so many movies with a believable likable story funny to think how well this film would have done if you could take away lets see the cinematography and special effects negative,there is not really any reasonable explanation why there are so many junk movies with ratings over 8 in imdb except the fact that unfortunately we are living in the age of materialism and total commercialism before mentioning anything about the dark knight itself i should point out that the movie business started as an experiment and furthermore it was and i hope it still is art if you are a part of the lucky people that had the chance to watch old movies starting from the early 1900s then you probably have noticed that despite the bad quality the technique and the style of directing cinematography acting and special effects are fascinating they are modern sincere effective touching thats where art starts and flourishes however if you take all the pointed out and replace them with high quality computer effects deafening soundtrack good looking actors banal plot and the appealing to the masses simple conflict of good vs bad well here is where commercialism begins its unstoppable brainwashing system the dark knight fits exactly the formula nothing more to say to those who agree there are still some great new movies coming out it just takes time to find them dont be discouraged by the overwhelming amount of junk films to those who disagree well consider watching casablanca silence of the lambs amadeus star wars p etc to those who dont take a side now is the time to do so to heath ledger you were just great and sorry to know this was the last time to see you [17 june 2009] later here now as i watched the film for a second time so that i would be entirely fair in my judgment i realized that 8 10 is a fair rating but and only but when the dark knight is rated on a different scale such as top movies based on a comics and what is a comics other than a combination of a simple plot good vs evil black and white characters lots of action the end when a movie has nothing more to add no fair character development acting no original twists in the chain of events no unique directing techniques then one cannot give it more than 5 10 and since the imdb has a great image the only way users can help keeping it safe and sound is by taking a little more seriously their voting rights [30 june 2009] negative,ill keep this short i rarely go to the theater but with the hype i had to go see this batman and the joker are invincible characters you know they wont die plot hole the police have the joker in an interrogation room with 30 officers on the other side of a 1 way mirror and the joker just killed the mayor the day before what do the police do any logical person in that situation would kill the joker period just shoot him i nearly walked out of the theater when the joker escaped imagine that heres the thing the joker isnt a serial villain here hes a terrorist hes osama bin laden normal rules of police interrogation shouldnt apply here and wheres the military the fbi this story made no sense to me well i tried to keep this short i want my 25 hours of my life backnegative,as a guy who loves the batman character and used to own a chain of comics stores in the late 80s through the 90s i found the new batman film to be abominable the handling of the batman character was the worst i have ever seen and i say that being someone who hates all of the other batman movies with the exception of batman begins it was a classic modern tearing down of an iconoclastic hero that was less realistic than its printed counterpart the batman character would never consider revealing his identity to appease the joker because he understands that you cannot appease pure evil he would instead redouble his efforts to find the joker not eating or sleeping until he did the batman of the comics is a detective who uses classical detecting techniques coupled with a healthy dose of bruised knuckles as he harasses the underworld to find his query in other words he uses no shortcuts he works hard hollywood used the opportunity to make a political statement having batman build a machine that taps into every cell phone in gotham city allowing for the altruistic lucius foxx character to opine about this act of immorality a none to subtle swipe at the bush administration then you have harvey dent two face who as the da of gotham is described by batman as the best of us all killing two dirty cops and to save the fragile collective psyche of gotham city batman takes the blame for the deaths of the cops why it would not make more since to simply reveal to the public that harvey dent went coo coo after the death of the women he loved as a result of another act of murder perpetrated by the joker with the help of the aforementioned dirty cops and the trauma of being disfigured is beyond me save that it fits into the paradigm of liberal thought that the people are to be protected from the grim reality of the world better to tear down the real hero of the saga and have him chased by the police keep in mind that the film establishes that the villains of gotham know from experience that batman will not cross the line and kill the worst of them but we are supposed to believe that the public of gotham will swallow that batman would kill two innocent cops wow batman is a character who is truly good and he has been tarnished by this film in a world where superman in his last film was reduced to a peeping tom hero with a babies mama psychopaths like marvels wolverine and the punisher are hailed as modern heroes a world where so many young people leave the theater declaring how cool heath ledger is as the joker and not how scary the character is i find that world tragic as one of our old comic shop patrons used to say give me the days when a hero had a letter on his chest a magic word a cape and a pet or side kick a hero that fought the bad guys because he was good and they were bad and they needed their a$$e$ kicked let justice be done negative,i gotta go against the grain here but after all the hype ive read here i expected no less than cinematic greatness what i got instead is that i got bored right out the theater its the only movie i actually walk out on this year and ive seen some pretty bad ones scenario linear predictable dark long and boring main actorchristian bale give me a break ive seen trees with more emotional depth supporting actors yeah ok heath ledger performance as the joker was inspired to say the least i was impressed a very difficult character to impersonate and he pulled it off the rest of the crew was adequate no more special effect great but were used to seeing great by now and theres too much of it editing inconsistent with bad rhythm music standard hollywood canned fare i found the whole indigestible rooting for the joker to kill them all about 3 4 of the way in so it would end and i could walk out ended walking out anyway without even caring how it endsnegative,there is nothing special about this movie period nothiing special it tries on so many levels to be this big mega movie and in financial terms it was but you know what its still not good no matter how many fans it has no matter how much money it pulls in those are just figures and numbers and theyre quite boring in the long run lets go over a few reasons why it was not good first off the story bites off way more than is necessary we have bruce wayne in this ridiculous attempt to win back a woman hell never have the chance to be with the woman he is in love with prances around like a little school girl and really has no business being in the story to begin with she is just there to make both batman and harvey dent rival each other im so sure that the writers could have come up with a better plan to pit the two against each other than that then theres the jokerthe most ridiculous part of the story ridiculous because of the lengths and the means that the filmmakers took to bring a new kind of villain its not entertaining its not disturbing its just sick this movie was not fun it was not entertaining it was a product for the mindless audiences who were going to buy into it anyway and especially because of the death of heath edger lets talk a little about that this film had success that rode the curtail of ledgers death the studio deliberately used the poor suffering of a human being to push a film into exhibition thats really sad and you know what else its all this film will ever bethe last film of heath ledger and america went to see it because he died before its release sad really sad i didnt like it and i bet others will not like me for that very reason even more sad stillnegative,this is the second worst film i have ever paid to see in a cinema the worst was zoolander where to begin the ersatz brooding music the inane plot the heavyweight philosophical dilemma posed by the two ferries episode the overacting the deeply pathetic ending there was much made in the british press about its violent content and the unsuitability of its certificate after seeing it all i can say is i didnt find the violence objectionable but emerged thinking that perhaps a new certificate is needed for the irredeemably crap avoid the tragedy of this and what personally makes me angry is that directors like loach and leigh could probably have made ten films on this budget even someone more expensive and supremely talented in the fantasy genre like gilliam or del torro could have made several what a waste negative,i think this movie deserves 7 stars but i give it 1 star because i dont think this movie should be so high in the top 250 imdb list i liked the performance of heath ledger as the joker that is why i think many people gave to the dark knight 10 stars and of course besides the great marketing that this movie had i didnt like the voice that christian bale used when he was dressed like batman he sounded so rare i think heath ledger is going to be nominated for the oscar awards for his performance as the joker in the supporting actor category in short this is a good movie but an overrated movie negative,i have enjoyed every outing of batman till i watched the dark knight and batman begins the basic story from a comic book is a comic story as soon as it is put into a semblance of real life it fails the main character is a man who dresses up as a bat this is funny the dark knight trilogy is made by people with no sense of humor who cares about lunatics that wear weird costumes and commit crimes in the real world these pathetic folks would be locked up the original batman tv show and tim burtons outings maintain the humor inherent in the story subtract the humor and you have long dull scenes in between action sequences get rid of the long talky scenes and the dark knight films would be fair action films if you are like me and prefer light and humor these films are not for you even breaking bad had some humor in it i maintain that batman is inherently humorous and thus the dark knight series fails to capture or honor the originalnegative,i saw the dark knight last night and although the movie itself isnt too bad its not as good as the batman fanboys would like you to believe the film has still a lot of flaws and the playtime is just too long ive seen people walk out 30 minutes before the movie ended just out of pure boredom if they would have made the film at a faster rate it would have been a lot better then theres batmans voice its absolutely absurt nobody talks like that well maybe ned from jimbo & ned southpark but really it makes the whole movie one big joke the side characters get far to little attention i cant remember any of their names only positive thing about this movie is the joker who makes an interesting bad guy i would have rated this movie a 6 because its not awful but im going to give it a 1 just because the current rate 92 is totally overratednegative,this movie was ok but it wasnt anywhere near as good as people claimed heath ledgers performance as the joker was great but his dialog for the most part was not all that interesting i was having fun with him at first especially when he told the story about how he got his scars the first time anyway but when he told that story the second time i was not impressed once was more then enough when it all comes down to it this movie was simply ok but because the death of heath ledger was such a shocker to the hollywood community this film got way more credit than it deserved and thats all there is too itnegative,spoilers this has to be one of the most boring movies in existencewith the exception of superman to me star wars has always been about the action scenes but theres barely any of them going on in this film the sappy romance subplot between han and leia falls flat on its face being too predictable the only good thing was vaders revelation that he was his father to luke and that wasnt even confirmed until the next filmi think i read something about that at one point it originally turned out vader was messing with lukes head all in all a weak film in the middle of the series bottom line the worst star wars movie yes i am including menace negative,i love the lord of the rings all 3 included i love the epic extremely long nature 3 hrs+ each that really allows the viewer to become immersed in the world that being said as much as a movie like braveheart is extremely under rated for its amazing acting directing etc lord of the rings is conversely overrated exhibiting in many instances very poor acting gimli anyone a weak translation of the book the books blow the movie away and truly subpar directing regardless of what the academy or any one of you fools may think lotr could have been a truly epic masterpiece if directed and acted accordingly however it still remains a very entertaining movie even with all of its flaws albeit in ten years it may unfortunately only be remembered as the most overrated movie in history 45 all time are you kidding me that is absolutely rediculous which is really a shame for such an ambitious fun to watch movienegative,i had such high hopes when i first heard that a tolkien fan was going to write and direct a live action+cgi version of lord of the rings only to have them cruelly dashed fotr was a bit rough but i said to myself itll only get better boy was i wrong i suppose the main problem is twofold first jackson is way too young inexperienced to have taken on this project he certain has ability but he has a lot to learn about filmmaking before even thinking about tackling such an ambitious project second for alleged lovers of the source material jackson and company took way too many liberties with the story changing them in pointless and even foolish ways perhaps this was inexperience maybe it was just laziness or a lack of understanding of the source material goodness knows that lotr is far from perfect as an example of storytelling but there is a great tale buried in tolkiens massive tome too bad that jackson and his crew were absolutely unable to bring it to the screen by the trotk jacksons exhaustion is practically oozing from the screen and hes lost sight of many key elements of the story negative,i just got home and i must say that i am not as satisfied as i thought i would be the film is very good but in my opinion is far way to be considered the best of the trilogy both previous movies were more intense than this one the battle scenes are awesome but the rest is very slow and quite difficult to stand for three and a half hour the ending is boring and that scene where legolas beats a mummakill cmon what does an army stands for if a single elf can handle such beast a third part of a trilogy which is in the 3rd place negative,it seems to me that much of the stylistic elements of the movie were taken from the 1955 film kiss me deadly kiss me deadly was full of quirky characters and had a mysterious chest which contained a glowing object the main difference in style was that the humor in kiss me deadly is much more subtle while pulp fiction is trying real hard to get a laugh or a reaction because of that i feel that kiss me deadly is the far superior of the twonegative,i really enjoyed this movie well about 45 minutes of it unless you are a die hard fanatic for the lotr books and maybe even then youll want to watch this with one finger on the fast forward button some scenes were excellent but not enough when diluted by so much filler the special effects may have been masterful but they didnt make it a great movie the movie simply takes itself far too seriously how else could the director possibly justify being almost 35 hours long similarly to voters here this is rated as #3 in the top 250 of all time that is so astoundingly overrated that i cannot understand it this with 65000+ votes it probably belongs in the top 1000 perhaps about #800 [how has the studio managed to create 45k+ imdb accounts to skew the voting] the basic flaw of the entire trilogy is that its based on a long winded violently racists set of books starting from that you end up with well you know truthfully this is a 7 10 but it could have been a 75 if theyd actually done some editing down to ~15 hoursnegative,this isnt actually a review of this movie but a review of the top 100 movies list here obviously if the majority of users on imdb rate lord of the rings the return of the king as the 4th best movie ever there either arent many users over 14 or the majority of users know very little about good film making im sure i could easily come up with 100 movies that are better than all 3 lord of the rings movies thats really all i wanted to say is that by rating lotr as one of the best movies ever youre proving to the world how useless this site is for knowledgeable critical movie reviews how can one take the ratings on this site seriously after having realized that lotr is the #4 best movie ever according to imdb usersnegative,this movie has to be the most overrated movie of all time i dont understand why everyone raves about this movie its boring the acting is shallow and weak the whole premise is annoying and i had to fight off sleep 3 times to finish this movie this movie has two layers boring barely audible speech and explosions i didnt think it to be possible but even the explosions were boring where does the fascination for this movie come from marlon brando may have been a good early actor but this ill make him an offer he cant refuse old man voice is so irritating i almost threw the dvd out the window however the movie ended up numbing all my extremities so that it was impossible to move as i had no choice but to sit on in horror im sorry i ever wasted my time on this piece of garbage with a weak premise ludicrous character designs and a plot that could cure insomnia godfather sleeps with the fishes with a 1 out of 10 negative,i hated it the movie was so long and it was hard to follow the sequels were ok i feel that this movie was over rated way too much so it had a good year in the seventies but come on how can this boring movie stand for 3 decades i just dont understand how that is possible marlon brando has had much better roles in on the waterfront a streetcar named desire and don juan marco just to name a few pacino wasnt even that good i much preferred him in carlitos way and donnie bras co and who could forget scarface pacino is getting typecast i think the only reason he did simone was to get away from the typecasting as a mobster or criminal i have to say i cant blame him pacino is also getting typecast as a cop i mean insomnia come onnegative, pulp fiction is one of the films they animated the students for the school mass acer in usa and all the other countries making a joke and kill men just in time that is modern massacer what a joke only not for the victims awful and so called in german brechmittel that is the real classification who want to see such a stupid story american people who vote with an average of 82 i cant understand are there so many cinema fans with boodles of beer in there hands or lines with cocaine and problems in there brains i dont know and i wonder me that there are ten lines necessary to vote for an awful film oh i see there must be ten lines and one line i have to write and with this line i reech it negative,actually i was hoping for a grand finale since the first installment was a glorious epic tale and the second was a piece of rubbish i was thinking that this moive would at least save the triologys face all starts good with a nice version of the becoming of gollum but to my dissapointment once again the story is told with the use of too much action scenes and some bland conversations and a gruesome amount of corny one liners the feel of an epic dissappears the moment the first flashback comes and the undeniably bad actress liv taylor makes an appearance yuck adn whats the deal with eowen she was alright in the two towers but now she suddenly becomes this girl power icon im not a man she says and slays a nazgul so what you say well its not the fact that she isnt a man that kills the witchmaster but the fact that its a elven blade that strikes him and if i recall it correctly its merry who deals that strike if the movie only would of stayed true to the book why doesnt it this was a once in an eternity opportunity and that dork peter jackson blew it as a movie fan im appaled and as a tolkien fan im angry rape negative,this movie will change you as some have commented it will bring you to a disgusting low definitely skip it or youll be sorry you didnt its a sickening wretchingly vile voyueristic wannabe false glorification skip it in fact be happy to skip it sometimes i think we have a big pile of juvenile retards on imdb that only hope to vote for any movie along the lines of its inherent jerry springer qualities and the judgement comes as a message about how low and worthless it can get this movie is not entertaining it is not nice it is not realistic it is racist degrading and stupid dont waste your money your time or your lifenegative,i cant believe that i wasted my life on this crap my dog sonny died yesterday because i made him sit through this flaming pile of horse excrement he ended up hijacking a semi and driving it into the grand canyon i sniffed the tv while this was playing and lemme tell you it smelled like freaking turds if i ever saw this movie again i would have to do things that will have me killed in every country to the filmmakers actors actresses animals and trees associated with this rotten indian food covered in bird feathers once i had a drink of water the water had a worm in it i didnt know that at the timenow back to the review i missed that worm he crawled out of me like that creature from the movie alien the doctors said i was gonna die i guess i showed them they will learn the true meaning of suffering they will feel the wrath of bob the worm anyway the godfather killed my dog so therefore it sucks donkey poop peace it sucks 1 10 negative,this is what i call a fad movie people say it is a great movie because other people said it is great people are afraid to express their true feelings because they dont want to be ridiculed by their friends especially if one is a member of the so called x generation i would imagine that the number of people who rented the video or saw it on cable that stopped watching the movie because it was so bad is fairly high especially for a movie that is considered a great movie however i concede that a number of people truly like it however i find that there are just as many people who are repulsed by this movie they just dont express their feelings in this type of format because a bad movie isnt worth the effort of making a negative opinionnegative,the movie is about an accountant who is accused of murdering his wife and her lover and as a result is sentenced for a life in prison the movie is filled with deep meanings but unfortunately it is very boring and directed in a very lame way plus the musical  is preety bad and does not spark any emotions from you in this type of movie an emotional and memorable musical  is very important but somehow the filmmakers did not seem to carenegative,i watched the film 20 years later since its making and attain 0% satisfaction of viewing pleasure considering its 5h top position on imdb the movie is an experimental art house crap that chooses no destination and lack brilliant appealing sketching of its theme the dialogues are the heartbeat of the film that lose its rhythm every moment when stretching same words to make viewers understood the characterss stand view in perplexing crime world and how they perceive the one thing the film depressingly is in desire of clapping is bruce willis part of a boxer who is feared but not a coward the rare male protagonist with conscience uma thurman leaves a desire to see her complicated struggle with drug lust and hunger to live free tarantino has tried to harvest a violent creativity but the offspring emits extragalactic passion that fail to make any beauty i have watched it and guarantee you waste of timenegative, the acclaim for pulp fiction shows just how ethically sick many of us in this culture have become this movie makes a joke out of murder torture and shooting heroin tarantino isnt making fun of these people or even the pulp fiction genre hes celebrating them he gets off on all of this and he hopes we will too if its hip to think that this celebration of evil is cool then i want to be as unhip as possible being a teacher of modern german and russian history you might say im not inclined to see physical brutality as entertainment and i frankly dont give a rats a for the opinion of all those clowns who gush over how tremendous this garbage is best movie of the 90s hands down what a crock negative, this film typifies what is wrong with the whole film world today when a morally bankruptintellectually challenged creep like the director of this piece can get a deal with a major studio it says a lot about the sad and pathetic state of movie making the level of hype surrounding this and the other place epithet here made by this twerp is disgusting what drugs are being passed around in hollywood board rooms id really like to know what kind of hallucinogenic it was i saw this place epithet here and i was disturbed in the way it manipulates the stupider members of the audience getting high on violence is a good thing tarantino is a cancerous festering oozing lesion on the anus of the film world good film making technique aside are we really prepared for the level of nihilism this kind of place epithet here represents this is just place epithet here elevated to olympian art film status the presence of some reasonably good actors just proves that actors generally have very poor judgement and like the misquote of hitchcock are cattle this and the previously mentioned diseases other films are the absolute ultimate in pandering to the lowest common denominator of the hormonally challenged adolescent male mindset that hollywood seems to be pervertedly in love with film school critic retards included this is only my opinion but i know other cinema literate people who share it the fact that this was nominated for oscars is too abhorrent to bear add style and you can serve overrated place epithet here to the most pretentious negative,pulp fiction has two things going for it sam jacksonrobbed at the oscars and christopher walkenwho has the films funniest sequence but thats all the tim roth amanda plummer scenes are irritating and too profaneswearings great but not like this the bruce willis gimp scene is memorable but a little sicko and the uma thurman sequenceyou know the one is absolutely unbearable she and travoltatoo fat to dance and never a terrific actor almost ruin this 1994 tarantino film single handedly but no it is tarantino himself that ruins the film everyone is nasty its excessive the way the three stories are told is confusing andthats about it some of it is funny and ving rhames is good as marsellus wallace but this is too much for me i know many like tarantino but i think hes a show off in the grand tradition of john wooone of his heroes apparentlynegative,bad bad bad it is such a shame that this movie is so bad it really has the potential to be great but no no no the first two movies were okay but this last one really sucked and yet everybody are joining this mass hysteria over this really really bad movie i just cant understand why a movie with really bad special effects and really bad acting bad directing but a great story can be the winner of 11 oscars the world has truly gone mad and to add it as the second best movie based on votes from users its sad just sad there are tons of movies that are better and this really is the movie that would never end very long ending 30 minutes of fading and ending only to not really end bearf i think people are mistaking the movie for the book sadnegative,when a prestige movie is made utmost attention is given to detail grandeur style and above all popularity godfather was a movie made to honor the great work of mario puzo who wrote a novel that brought true attention to the human side of the gangster mobster capolla knew that he had embarked on a great mission when he set out to perform the unthinkable to show the world that the leaders in crime have souls and that they are certainly not invincible this movie was what it was meant to be a prestige movie it took very few risks and was filmed to simply document the lives of its characters i found the godfather to be a very well done movie in fact i enjoyed this movie so much that i have watched it on many occasions this movie serves as a soap opera of the gangster world to me and it tells its story very well however i do not believe that any film of this character should be given such a high accord in the top 100 ranking the highest position on the rating scale should be given to a movie that fulfills the requirements of a movie to the tee the godfather does not do this as precisely as other movies people go to see movies simply to be displaced from their ordinary lives to be transported to another world life place or perspective the godfather does a very feeble attempt at fulfilling this essential requirement not at one moment in this movie does the audience become disconnected with themselves there is not a single instance where the actions on the screen become real and where the world in which the audience is watching from fades away to those of us who believe in the true excellence of movies the godfather does not rate anywhere near the `best movie of all time movies such as moulin rouge citizen kane requiem for a dream the matrix casablanca momento and even depending on the viewer gladiator all grasp the viewer by their hair and thrust them into another world if for only a few seconds the movie watching experience is topped by this disconnection from the real world it leaves us in a feeling of awe and shows us that the movie we just watched was more than just a movie but a journey into the minds of the characters on the screen and in some unique cases a journey into the great depths of our own minds with this sort of depth and greatness these types of movies should be all in the top 10 this unique greatness is not easily achieved in order to capture the audience in such a thrilling way a great deal of effort must be spend meticulously building up the pace and timing of the movie the climax should be the point where the viewer has already been captured into the movie and should thus create a `climatic experience thus blowing the viewer away the godfather has none of these elements perfected to such a state that they encapsulate the viewing public to a degree worthy of its ranking so it is therefore obvious that the godfather does not reach the greatness of a few other better movies and so it is not deserving of its top ranking if it were up to me i would move the godfather down to 5 or 6 and leave room the real screen gems to be appreciated this movie gets a rating of 9 out of 10negative,wat the hell is good about this movie its too streched out silly stupid ending every second you think its going to end but noooooooooo one more scene to gotoo long for nothing 3 hours can be smidged into an hour and a halfthe pervious 2 are much betterthat film is sososososos overrated its patheticnegative,im sorry but i dont get it why is everybody so crazy about this movie is it because of the effects we have seen better even in old movies this one didnt impress me is it because of the story we have seen better the story and the characters in this movie seem to be taken from an old days disney fable ok is it because the actor who plays the joker died in real life after finishing it if thats the reason why is that exciting and anyway then it has nothing to do with cinema itself i admire the performance of the two main male actors both bale and ledger play very well indeed as usual but unfortunately their job cant compensate for the flat performances of their colleagues specially that of maggie gyllenhaal nor for the many deficiencies of the script the result is an unbalanced movie the interactions between the characters is awkward they move around in a world that doesnt seem to fit them a bit predictable a bit overloaded for a movie to be a classic it has to give you something it has to make you grow and it has to grow in you this movie is definitely not in this categorynegative, this movie is seriously over hyped crap from a completely technical view it has some merits its well filmed the shots and cutting are phenomenal the plot has some merit although there was a whole of one thing i didnt see coming throughout the whole film the one scene i enjoyed is on the boats a deep look into humanitys fragile tempers christian bale is terrible in his role of batman his voice is so forced he makes it way too gravelly and just botches the whole thing he allows absolutely no subtlety and the love story angle is so contrived god he was terrible oooh now we get to the poster boy heath ledger ok i do have to grant that he did a fairly good job in his portrayal of the joker his lines are well delivered and his acting is good but this idea that he is now the holy grail of acting is just stupid he died so now everyone feels like they cant critique him when did death make you amazing fine then hitler was a saint cause he died we arent allowed to say he messed up ever he did a good job but there have been far better actors i feel the writing was almost as important to the character as his acting doesnt matter how good you act if the writing sucks the movie sucks on to a one aaron eckhart decent acting far better in thank you for smoking but thats besides the point i dont have much to say other than he started really strong and finished off pretty weak after one of the plot twists his acting just gets mediocre all in all this movie would have been really good i mean phenomenal if it werent for all of the hype around it i saw it in theaters a day or so after opening and enjoyed it until about the 4 millionth why so serious half an hour after it was over it was good but it belongs in maybe the low hundreds on the top 250 list not top 10 negative,i really hate reviews where people write about how much they hate some movies but i found this movie so annoying that im really surprised why did people like it so ill just try to explain why i didnt like it 1this is the most boring movie i have ever seen i never liked batman movies but this is the worst one i watched it just because my friend told me it was good but i didnt enjoy it i nearly fell asleep 2 the movie doesnt have any sense its stupid i dont get the ideaits flat 3 the characters are so annoying there is no likable character in this movie all of them are boring i have to admit that heath ledger was great but there is nothing else i liked in this movie its just my opinion maybe i just didnt get somethingnegative,ive seen a lot of movies in my days this one was fine but not the best a movie should keep you entertained not make you think  when is this going to end did not deserve to be n1 in imdb all that surrealism mostly boring in parts even disturbing maybe few of you will enjoy it but i think it would be better if there was more done in less time rather than the opposite the same old stuff happens like a soup opera you like it in the binging you say to your self  this will be good imdb was right but an hour later you think yeaah been there done that lets turn it off think about it was this the best youve ever seen no negative,just read the title tough i think its a pretty decent movie but not as good as the stephen kings novel i just cant understand why it should deserve to be ahead of everyone else in the top 250 with the exception of the godfather to be honest i dont even really think it should be in the top 250 yeah i know you americans love the happy ending vaseline flavored subtly homosexual jail movies but all this hype its too much anyway come on this cant be better than welles kubrick kurosawa or scorsese or not even carpenter and fulci in my humble opinion so i give it a 1 10 this is not a critical valuation of the movie this is a political statementnegative,by far the most overrated movie in the history of movies whats even the point of making these types of movies when they are so unreal in a bad way is this movie about one guy who can allegedly kick ass we all know whats real and whats not wright and what probably would have happened to that kind of hero you just have to assume in fact this would have happened in real lifesnl digital short hero song overall the movie is very boring and confusing there is something far more entertaining and its thisdigital short batman snl negative, the dark knight is not a good movie by any measure i will now proceed to provide reasons for this statement in the process of which spoilers will abound in this film batman the batman as the characters refer to him possesses superpowers rivaled only by superman he bends gun barrels using his bare hand yes only one hand and falls from ridiculous heights not deploying his cape and lands without as much as a scratch to his body the batman is apparently not aware that it is not the fall that kills you it is the quick acceleration at the end and no matter the quality of the batsuit that acceleration cannot be reduced on the other hand his kevlar batsuit which evidently is impervious to bullets of small hand guns fired at close range is unable to withstand dog bites the joker whose obvious insanity is the only light of the movie is well played by ledger who flares with his eyes and mouth to give him an almost rabid portrayal but other than being a dark menace to society his odd manners and at one time drag outfit provide comedic relief in the film apart from being just a regular killing maniac he also possesses superpowers of his own in the film he is depicted with an apparent and sporadic invisibility to police forces that they do not notice his deformed face without make up in their own ranks during a salute may be pardonable but when blowing up an apparently unsurveilled hospital on prior warning and then leaving in full make up in a school bus his escape vehicle of choice also from bank raids his failed apprehension seems unpardonable unless of course all the cops had their lunch break as the sun indicates it is around noon the plot is so thin at times you expect it to crack at any moment it is like there are many small plots in all of which batman the purported main character plays but a small role whatever the joker has been doing all his life before going on a murder spree is pardonable to omit but when he breaks into bruce waynes penthouse probably using his cloaking capabilities the same locale that a few scenes later will be referred to as the safest place in town by the same person who was tossed out a window during this same brief encounter it is an interesting question just how the maniac and his armed gang are persuaded to leave the party full of gothams economic elite something they must have done without causing much further harm as it goes largely unnoticed by the other characters batman speaks with a deathly voice that is so ghoulish it could scare off any foe would he just make more use of it against his enemies and not blather like that to his friends that he finally tracks the joker down is not due to any superior detective skills as he gets good help from prying on all of gothams mobile phones that he immorally and secretly has replaced with his own brand all in one nights work more ridiculous plot element is hard to come by negative, it is a great pity that people cannot distinguish between great works of literature and the failure to exemplify these works in the cinema graphic medium these three films adapted from the great work were shot on low quality film and in a manner to make the greatest profit from as much exploitation of its artisans as possible for example peter jackson knew that he could new zealand citizens to be extras at no costs due to the novelty of under taking such a project of this magnitude and glamor in a parochial isolated hometown new zealand countryside peter jackson fran walsh and philipa boynes bought the film rights of the great literature for a massive cost and then hired scriptwriters to prepare the screenplay adaptation in their names at great cost this was a very poor screenplay if you really loved the books and actually read them which most of the films audience probably never could or did how the motion picture academy members voted it best screenplay adaption and gave the award to these three people is rather suspicious the cinematography was very poor with many shots out of focus and overuse of various camera techniques this has been supported many cinematographers in many blogs the acting performances were very mediocre and the selection of actors was purposefully chosen from australians and new zealanders due to peter jacksons view that they are better actors than americans and the british in fact australians and new zealanders have this strange dislike americans despite consuming their films the animations of various creatures was so similar to the vampires in dusk till dawn it makes you wonder if the cgi people had much imagination the many gratuitously violent scenes not described as such in the books would have been very frightening to children let alone the ridiculous characterization of the golum in fact most of the cgi was carried out by americans hired by peter jacksons multi million dollar cgi suite which at the end of the day makes you wonder where mr peter jackson got the money to not only buy the film rights to the books but to build a multi million dollar film effects studio in new zealand the whole thing was obviously a massive profit making exercise in profit making with peter jackson and his mates securing huge merchandising deals in the planning of the projectit is further proof that the very wealthy and privileged can always demonstrate what their money can achieve not what they themselves can achieve due to any talent or real imagination it was not made for the sake of love of a great work of literature but for profit and self aggrandizement i fully understand that films must make profit but this one really couldnt go wrong with the material and the present day innovations in cgi i am certain that one day someone will remake it and do it properly and maybe some one like john boorman who was originally going to make the film i am so content in thought that there is a great difference between people like myself and the people who glorify this film and peter jackson negative,why does everyone like this movie its not particularly that good and everything in it is just so so wrong its ok for the government and the people in charge to lie to the masses the masses thats you are too stupid to rule themselves its ok to use peoples private cell phone info oh just this one time morgan freeman says thanks this is a fascist film it is fascist propaganda wake up people you should be outraged the movie is tell the audience you are idiots and look how easily we control you and make you think this is some great movie and look how much money we can make off your desperate desires thank god obama became president this movie seemed to be financed by the bush administrative prepping people for more bs who is this batman oh so troubled batman hes a rich white boy with guilt he doesnt want to play along so he goes out and inflicts the masses with his own morals which turns out to be exactly the same as his fellow rich white boys that rule poor little rich white boy this is a scary scary propaganda movie ten years from now well look back at this in horrornegative,im sorry but im not being paid to write these reviews and it sure looks like those ahead of me are did we see the same picture i thought it was too long confusing poor plot line very very dark a lot of gratuitous violence and ledgers performance was just not oscar material as so many are proclaiming during the movie several people got up and left there were a couple of times there my date and i thought about leaving but we paid premium bucks to see the thing and you hate wasting money like that the film gets off to a pretty good start we were all excited but as it went along it began to drag ledger looks awful and they relied enitrely on makeup with no prosthetics they way they did with nicholson to give you the impression of a smiling joker here it was just white and red makeup piled on the way a six year old might do after getting into mommys makeup and dark everything was so dark throughout the film that each time someone opened a flip phone it was as bright as a flashlight i thought surely they arent going to call anyone but because so many were doing it i figured they were looking at the time a sure sign that the film was lumbering along from this viewers perspective i thought it was awfulnegative,this movie was disgusting and the language was deplorable it didnt make a lot of sence as they were constantly jumping from one scene to another it was like multiple perverted cartoons put on one movie if i had known what it was going to such a nasty perverted movie i would have never even touched the movie if you are thinking of watching this movie do not watch this movie it is a waste of time it is a lot of trash also remember what you put in your mind comes out in your actionsnegative, could someone please tell me why this movie is so damned popular people say that i simply dont understand it i admit it no i simply cant see anything interesting in this piece of just like the other movies of tarantino and my own fellow country man lars von trier who has also been so over praised by the critics i would like to say that i do find difficult films like the films of kieslowski fassbinder etc interesting these films are about real characters and not some overestimated roles well we all have different tastes including films but until this moment no one has ever been able to argue why pulp fiction is his her personal favourite movie of all time they always just say that this movie is so cool exciting interesting etc negative,to say that this movie is overblown pap is an understatement like its predecessors this flick employs just about every movie clich‹© in cinema history like long long death scenes fake death scenes how many times did freddo die only to our surprise hes really not dead at all  a mans gotta do what a mans gotta do scenes in fact what with the clip clop galloping of horses everywhere i thought it had strayed into a western ride like the wind type comments abound the mad bad king who dies a horrible death coz hes so mad and bad the cute little hobbits were all supposed to cheer for and even a darth vader type chief villaincoupled with a script that was so lame the better actors were really pushing themselves to the limit trying to make the lines sound at least half original in fact the only interesting characters in this enermous exercise in money grabbing movie cynicism were the villains the orcs at least had character not surprising then that the movie relies upon the gollum to sell it in years to come this lumbering saga of over hyped over produced trash will be not be regarded in the same way star wars is but in the same way titanic is bit of an embarrassment negative,the godfather is elevated pants its considered a classic because it was cynically designed to be a classic it knows the the secrets of tension and payoff it hooks the idiots with some random moaning broad getting boned in the first few minutes and enough money was pumped into it that it looks like a painting in motion you got breasts and glamourized gangster machismo for the men and scenic rural italy for the women it would be obvious how paper thin and sadly calculated it all really is if the performances didnt propel it into something approaching three dimensionality i prefer goodfellas because it deconstructs everything the godfather is about and is a much more natural intuitive film in the processnegative, it seems to be the fashion among film intelligentsia to give wild praise to the most incomprehensible and incoherent rubbish sending the partly unspoken message that if you the film goer do not get it you are not smart enough to understand it this applies to most of the oeuvre of the late stanley kubrick with the exception of lolita dr strangelove and to a point a clockwork orange and it applies equally well to this odd and trashy bit of nonsense handed to us by quentin tarantino to say that sitting through it was painful would be an understatement but if that isnt bad enough it is also incoherent and confusing at one point the samuel l jackson character dies if memory serves only to show up alive later with no explanation given uma thurman is striking to look at in that dark wig and travolta stretches what little acting talent he has but i still to this day have no idea what the movie was about and frankly tarantino failed to make me care very much like most of kubricks work this film is visually striking the color palette in particular is stunning but at the end of the day how a film looks means nothing unless there is some substance underneath the surface and if there is any here i did not see it at the time this movie came out the critics were falling all over themselves proclaiming that it represented a new direction for hollywood films fortunately that seems not to have been the case negative,really this movie is wrong in every way it is an example of how not to tell a superhero movie placing it in reality is ok but then you are bound to the rules of reality and this movies applies superhero rules in realityjumping on a car in the car park without breaking legs and it also defies logichenchmen who keep getting killed and still there is an ample supply of to fill the ranksthese guys must be dumb a villain who act contrary to what he proclaims he isnt funnyhe is not chaos he acts to much like like an einstein for that needless sidetracks that lead to nothingthe whole bullet set up the philosophy 101 scenes that interrupt the flow of the movie just to make a point is so lame the totally wooden acting from everyone except ledger and oldmanas if they edited all the worst takes of the other actors to give ledgers performance some shine setting is not gothic it is dark techno punk or tech noir the city doesnt look like the city in batman beginswhich was a great film this part is not needed if you look at the three movies because it has nothing to do with the story line of batman begins and the dark knight rises dent was not in bb and tdkr and two face was killed in this movie and rachel whose part had a different actress than bb is killed of and for the plot of tdkr rachel is only needed to be reminded that she is dead and would not have waited for bruce even the jokers performance isnt that great either but it stands out because all the other acting is wooden i can continue about more things that annoy me about the dark knight but then i can write a page full of thingswhat surprised me what rating this got and that is too much for such a bad movies that tries to be two movies at once but fails at both of them and the raspy voice and way to prominent soundtracknegative, i love the fact that the movie give us an insight in something we would as normal people never get the chance to know its a world full of traditions family values rich and explicit verbal and behavior language but also a world of corruption power deceit and murder francis ford coppola knows how to create this italian american feeling throughout the whole movie and it never feels superficial its a very good movie but not extra ordinary i lack a bit of depth in the storyline like in the approach of the young son michael being dragged into the world of the mafia it was a bit too easy he gets smacked in the face by a corrupt cop and suddenly he wants to shoot everybody i think i miss an essential scene between him and his father in the clinic anyway trying to keep the godfather on number feels a bit compulsory and bizarre i think that this great movie needs to get away from this forced spotlight position so we can appreciate the film without all this hype and we shouldnt be blind to other great cinematic pearls being made in recent years negative,this film is very stereotypical and as i am half italian i feel i have the right to stick up for the crowds of real italians who find this film totally offensive and even boring this kind of film can lead to racist attitudes in our society as its portrayal of normal folk is completely over the top ott marlon brando received many praises for his performance but there are too many inaccuracies too mention in his accent never mind his mannerisms i watched this film with my friend his italian wife and her parents who dont speak english and get this they fell asleep the greatest movie of all time and they fell asleep i managed to stay awake but it was hard but my friend loved it for some weird reason but hes an oddball so he doesnt count certainly does not deserve to be numero one instead may i suggest the princess bride a classic tale of love and adventurenegative, ok ill admit i liked the godfather but #1 movie of all time that is sickening a good movie is not a movie that is fun if it was then #1 would be a bad james bond movie any movie that is close to the top 10 should be a movie that gives you meaning outside of the theater not a movie about false organized crime how the hell did this movie get #1 if its just a movie about killing the only movie i can think of that should get #1 is american beauty negative,in the movie there was more talking then fighting and harveys killing spree wasnt all that good threatening to kill a child is one thing but holding a gun and falling off a roof with batman why not just shoot the damn thing the family live whoop dee doo but batman just leaving the joker dangling up there like a puppet wasnt all that great yes the jokes & sarcasm were hilarious but the entertainment was awful its rated pg 13 for intense sequences of violence and some menace the sequences were not intense and were most definitely not violent when we see marvel and movies based on old characters we expect power fighting and conflicts but in this movie wheres the power fighting conflitcs nowhere to be found so the joker got arrested yippee he escaped and only took one life the scenes with those 2 boats were really unnecessary having a ferry full of civilians and another full of criminals and both with a remote to blow the other up and are threatened to blow up at midnight midnight comes and everyone is still alive and none of the ferries were blown big whoop all in all the movie sucked id advise all you people who loved batman when they were kids to not see this movienegative,well the praise for this movie must be due to heath ledgers death or at least i hope thats the reason because the movie is pretty disappointing ledger is a convincing maniac but the rest of the cast falls short is christian bale in this movie i think he gets the least screen time of the three leads ledger eckhart included and really doesnt get many good lines the only scenes i enjoyed were between he and ledger the editing of this film reflects the jokers theme chaoswas that intentional if so a poor choice after the wonderful simplicity of many superhero films including batman begins id give that a 9 10 dark knight may have not been edited at all it seems thrown together with no accounting for the viewers intelligence ive seen better episodes of televisionnegative,this movie had too much action for me unlike everybody else in the world nowadays i dont care for action movies i lost interest about halfway through the film maybe when youve actually seen lots of blood and gore in the real world it spoils action packed movies for you it seems to have done so for me this film does have more characterization and plot development than most action movies i think thats why its been so highly rated i found the plot puerile however i will say this for the dark knightthough it is probably one of the most cerebral action movies to date unfortunately cloaking a comic book in realism cant hide its true colorsnegative, instead of questioning capitalism communism taoism or existentialism and challenging the audience it is about corruption and surrendering to corruption like surrendering to jaded teen boredom fueled by the claustrophobic helplessness due to terrorism and the merciless acceptance of hipster nihilism tdk is a cold unrealistic mechanical set up sold over and over again by its proponents as ultra realistic that is the most frightening thing about the obsessive if not immoral blatherings of tdk fans is the emperors new clothes insistence that the film represents realism from the jokers precision timing to drive a school bus into a line of school buses with one space left for him to dents facial damage due to 5 seconds of burning gasoline the film is rife with movie fakeness sold like ad or add pitchmen for nolans formulaic realism which is actually just him stealing from the long halloween a meaningless rube goldberg contraption nolan takes the audience on an endless set of fake out twists and turns to deliver very little but loud moments as calculated and obsessive as the joker is and to the degree he plans about 5 separate back up plans that come to fruition he enters the level of anal retentive yet somehow we are to believe he is some agent of chaos which means cool chaos = cool get it theres nothing cool or chaotic about this drugged out riffing joker and as fun as ledger makes him he overshadows what should have been the center of the story harvey dent but its batman so business as usual problem child villain acts up makes a mess batdad shows up to clean up the mess crowd applauds unfortunately what the film creates is a subtext of a neocon wetdream with by any means necessary militarism where the batman uses unethical means to detect the joker and we are to assume this fall from grace makes him heroic because he is banished and falsely accused for 1 minute of nagging by the joker turning dent evil for yet another film coincidence of driving dent from white to dark knight so batman takes the blame and is the dark knight cuz hes just a christ figure so our sacrificial justice league hero is supposed to be a sympathetic figure of crossing moral boundaries to save society george bush must have loved this puppy not sure half the tween tards watching this caught that bit of hooey but as much as the poster art evokes fight club this film is about as far from punk anarchy as you can get maybe they should all be sent to military school if this is their idea of rebellion negative,i just rented this from netflix and forced myself to watch it till the end what a dreadful boring yet expensive movie it was so dimly lit they could have had any of the thousands of out of work actors in southern california in it with no perceptible difference i guess a couple more explosions would have helped not really i only watched it cause of heath ledgers excellent performance in brokeback mountain boy was i disappointed i didnt care about anyone while watching except for myself who was waiting for it to end at times the dialog was difficult to understand with the volume way up but the loud soundtrack made every sound effect rattle the furniture i just dont get what passes for great entertainment nowadays i had to watch some old rocky and bullwinkle cartoons afterward as an intelligent antidote to this cartoonish movie that tries for so much significance an odd combination its like looking for significance and the meaning of life in an infomercial dont bothernegative,all i think i need to say is this was a good film but needs to be out of the top 100 movies of all time its not that good its just a batman film and thats all it will ever be ok it may be the best batman film made but thats not hard to do was it people need to really think before they vote and not give it ten out of ten just because the joker is now dead i would have really given it an 7 10 but gave it a 1 10 because it needs to get out of the top 100 but all in all its worth a look 7 10 vote the film not the actornegative,this movie is ranked as the 4th best on imdb that pisses me off because so many people think imdb top 250 is the definitive list it is not in fact it is not much different from all the other voting lists done by the public and people who put this in there top 10 you will find have not seen many of the classics or dont like them cos they are stupid or just in there teens or both like i am but i know movies now just know this is not a top 10 if anything it is at the bottom off a top 100 list im not saying this cant be in your top 10 favorite movies it can it can be number 1 if you want but dont say it is one of the top 10 best movies ever because it is not the same with a lot of other top 250 films shawshank is not the best film off all time i will give you my list of my 10 favorite films off all time 1 the godfather 2 pulp fiction 3 raging bull 4 apocalypse now 5 the good the bad and the ugly 6 a clockwork orange 7 2001 8 life of brian 9 taxi driver 10 one flew over the cuckoos nest only 2 maybe 3 of them are top 10 material and those are the godfather raging bull and maybe 2001 but i can admit that those others are not as high as i would place them all you dark knight fan boys should start like a lot of the other overrated movies on the list it is still great but it doesnt deserve to be so high for better lists of best movies off all time look at afi 100 years 100 movies and sight & sounds pollnegative,how many times does a crook have to be caught and released over several boring hours to make a movie feel dynamic spoilers if joker has so few people in his gang especially if he goes around killing them on a regular basis how does he get the large set pieces sorted out exploding buildings and boats etc yes it was fantasy that much is clear but rushing from set piece to set piece drama tension explosion is poor production technique but a 91 rating over 270000 voters this will be a lone voice probably in the love fest that has occurred around this title please no oscar nominations glad i got that off my chestnegative,i am deeply shocked‰Û_ i am really shocked that this film made it all the way to the top its ok with me that it is a huge success at the box office i can cope with it that many many people do not have the same taste as me even though it is a little sad because i think this somewhat strange taste of the comic buffs will influence the movies in the future even more there are interesting articles about the influence of the bloggers and hardcore fans on producers and directors what really shocks me here is that many many acclaimed critics fail to see how bad this movie is they write about hidden stories meanings and messages the war in iraq the war against terrorism a reflection of american society and so on they write about hilarious performances of the actors they write about stunning visual effects some of them may even write about the tremendous script fortunately so far i did not read anything about the scriptwriting so i try to begin with that issue well the script is so down down deep down below that i dont even know where i shall begin i guess the guys who are more in the comic stuff will tell you that jonathan nolan really did a good job in adopting the stories and the mood of the comic books but for me this is no reason to write a story that lacks everything and is so brain dead that im gasping for air the plot is annoying and predictable the characters are written really poorly first of all harvey dent his turning into a fallen angel is so incredibly incredible it may result from the way that the brains of the comic buffs work 9 pictures or less per page i that time you can turn from a white hero into a black devil but this is a movie and no 9c trash book to say it clear ‰ÛÒ and you may have noticed ‰ÛÒ i am no comic fan but i like for instance sin city very much it is a very good adaptation into a now medium and it is visually very interesting visuals as i said sin city is visually very interesting the dark knight is not totally not almost two decades before we saw terminatorii oh my god this was something new and two face ‰ÛÒ aaron eckhart looked a little like the wrecked arni back then dont get me wrong the make up apartment did a very good job it is just so sad that we already saw it all before just like the inspection of the new weapons‰Û_ is this a scene of one of the bond movies or take the matrix part1 about one decade before visually the dark knight is not one tick better or more interesting maybe on the same level sin city was something new the dark knight shows us common techniques in a slightly higher perfection the directing is average not outstanding it must have been a logistic masterpiece ok but we have seen it before the acting i cant even say if the actors are bad i think it is the story that is so poor the joker is good heath ledger is good not brilliant or something like that it is solid work and he is the only character that is somewhat interesting and not full of pathetic crap well to draw the conclusion again i can live with it that this movie is that successful at the box office i can not live with the super high praising comments of professional critics for action entertainment this movie is too long at least one hour is simply annoying again the writing so who ever has some bucks left go see this movie and see what brain damaged meansnegative,by far the most overrated hunk of junk i have ever viewed who the heck thinks this is a good movie its just another in a long line of stupid super hero comic book movies that have come out to the theater in the past few years the acting is terrible from batman himself who i couldnt understand half the things he was saying to the very barely average performance of ledger they consider his role oscar material youve got to be kidding you want to see a good performance go rent monsters ball even the patriot he was better the special affects are nothing to go crazy about just your typical cgi thats not so spectacular nowadays and that plot like that made allot of sense but i guess like adam sandler movies people like this garbage to think this movie is getting higher ratings than the godfather movies shawshank pulp fiction schindler list star wars and casablanca shows you the mentality of todays movie viewernegative,i give it one star because of the headache inducing over storyboarded and dull midsection a botched directorial effort by nolan 1 mid point scenes of harvey dent character w maggie gyllenhall scenes of commissioner gordon & cops etc slowed movie down drudgingly with boring back story needed 20 minutes shaved off 2 batman fight scenes had elbow jabs galore and looked like a blur 3 choppy story editing in first half of movie swung from action scenes to modern high rise scenes back and forth like a yo yo felt like i was going up and down an express elevator gave me a headache 4 not enough joker in first half see first aspect 5 two face shouldve lived but the special fx on him were overkill 6 the mayor played by a too young and effeminate looking actor with obvious mascara looked ridiculousnegative,first of all tdk surely surpassed every hype made before an amazing acting of a crew assembled beautiful direction made this movie memorable i stunned to watch the scene in which batman was flying with wing after jumping from that amazing designed building it had never been used such beautiful scene before the whole movie was full of thrills and overall impact was so laud but the trump card of this movie is the card of joker a joker usually comes in movie or drama to put an element of entertainment in itbut many time many director use it to express some complex thing because common audience can also understand the language of a joker i remembered very well about my childhood that i could understand only part of the joker in drama which i saw then hence v for vendetta or or others of same type movies put their things beautifully in front of common of common audience the joker of tdk have also to say something to this common people but he show his dark sidethe character of joker in tdk is the best of all time jokerheath leather we will miss you nolan is a great geniusnegative,this is the 3rd best film on imdb just came out of the cinema and couldnt believe my eyes what a waste of time money & human creativity this is so far the worst film ive seen this year & easily the worst film christopher nolan has directed why do great actors like christian bale heath ledger and michael caine accept such roles ‰ÛÓ are they in it just for the money thats totally okay but then they should refrain from jazzing up this piece of crap and just say what it is ‰ÛÓ a shallow pathetic off the rack exploitation movie for brain damaged teens i had a hard time piecing that pseudo heroic dialogue together ‰ÛÓ at times it seemed to come straight out of fortune cookies at times i didnt even know what the hl the people on screen were talking about never mind the totally unimaginative camera storytelling action scenes everything everything was just so seen before laughable enough said voted 1 out of 10 just for the ok & above average acting of heath ledgernegative,this is one of the most over rated pieces of $hit ive ever had the misfortune of watching went to the cinema to see this when it came out and was bored $hitless only now do i have the patience and calm to write a review well done to the makers of the movie for exploiting heath ledgers death to the maximum to push this movies appeal to the general public christopher nolan is a hack director in my opinion scene upon pointless scene of boring tedious dialogue scenes that drag and drag going nowhere christian bale was utterly dire as batman not only was the voice he put on absurd but he just doesnt suit batman end of story heath ledger while a competent actor was nothing special as the joker yet again another over rated aspect of this movie his performance it was mediocre the plot is ludicrous with the joker planting bombs without getting caught etc thats another thing id like to mention chris nolan tapped into a bit of terrorism here9 11 anyone dont tell me none of you noticed this what a total cop out lets get the american viewers attention by throwing in a bit of 9 11 themed stuff after the film ended i was really angry that i had been charged an extortionate amount of my hard earned money to watch this garbage what was worse was having to read and hear about the raving reviews of this total mess of a film to hell with all the fan boys who will defend this plastic pretentious charade at all costs who gives a flying phuck how much money it made it was utter $hitnegative, the star wars movies were the worst movies of all time science fiction by itself is bad enough let alone being a cult like nerd flick the music was the best thing and even that was melodramatic at times and come on whats the whole long time ago thing if we dont have flying machines now we most certainly didnt have them in the past ok so maybe the star wars movies dont belong on the bottom 100 but in the top ten is ridiculous what a protagonist i say as the great mavoric murdock said only the best will be the worst the irony in this comment is astounding for you see if the public does not recount the degeneracy who will let me explain for every brilliant movie made there are many more hidieous movies so then if there are an abundance of awful movies then mediocre ones will seem fantastic and good ones will seem godly for example the godfather my point is that the praise of star wars is merely a product of being surrounded by worse movies negative, all of the lord of the rings movie are overrated but thats just my opinion they are not good enough to even be on the top 250 how could this be number 3 or did u just say hmm this movie won an academy award umm it must be good its not all it was was action and boringness now i dont necessarily hate these movies but definantly overrated i mean not even being worthy of an academy award or being on the top 250 i mean come on people ive seen people with good movie taste say these were good in my opinion the 2nd one was the best and the others were hardly okay for me and i did not like the 3rd and was very angry wen i saw it under godfather and the shawshank redemption i mean jeez now this is only my opinion but i know several people who agree with me now this is just my opinion so dont get all offended negative, i watched the fellowship & could live with the changes the two towers made my heart sink too many alterations & additions yes additions i can understand cutting the story to fit but shovelling lumps of extraneous storyline in that is not in the book why extra elves at helms deep wtf why cut bits that those familiar with the books are expecting to add garbage that no one expects i cant explain the return of the king was for me the last straw the return of jacksons ego more like why they saw fit to change dialogue from the original in some cases only a few words & in others changing the speaker of the words this is peter jacksons lotr not tolkeins i havent checked but the credits should show inspired by jrr tolkein because this is not his work i will stick with the bbc 4 version which while abridged is true to tolkein & the pictures are better on radio negative,as god as my witness as god as my witness theyre not going to lick me im going to live through this and when its all over ill never be hungry again nor any of my folk if i have to lie steal cheat or kill as god as my witness ill never be hungry again this is what i was fully expecting to come pouring from sams mouth as he and frodo were collapsing for what seemed like the 200th time on the way to get rid of the ring or was that the heart of the ocean from some of the music and the similarity in the scenes between throwing the ring into the fire and heart of the ocean into the sea i wasnt sure i didnt know if i was watching gone with the wind titanic or some hobbit movie and if they had cut about an hour of elijah woods pained and soulful looks into the distance and the eyes of his friends they could have made the movie a manageable length just a wee bit too much drama what a disappointmentnegative,pulp fiction in my opinion is the most overrated movie of all time i really dont understand why many people claim it to be one of the greatest movies ever its cruel stupid idiotic its full of violence & f words to the point that its sickening its like lets get a couple of guns a couple of f words a couple of murders and lets combine them to make a movie i hated everything about it everything to me all the positive comments on this site about this movie are written by only 1 fan under different usernames so the scenes were not in chronological order big deal that doesnt make it a masterpiece this is hollywood garbage there are some scenes that are sick the movie is sick this is my review i gave it a 2 10 just because the actors are respected everything else is idioticnegative,rotk is one of the most hyped movies of all time i think that it is also the most personally disappointing movie i have ever watched i was so excited to see this film i was left with a bitter taste in my mouth the first blow came when instead of showing the white wizard sauromans demise we open the film with something from the hobbitgollums backstory this made me mad because i was told that sauroman was cut because they didnt want to dwell on two towers apparently they didnt mind dwelling on the hobbit so what you have in return of the king is a villianous army with no general no main villian save for sauron who is only in the film as a spirit only what you have as the main villian is a bunch of stunt guys in very good costumes the action is fine in the film but aragorn just doesnt sell his part well imho his leaving to find the ghost army is waaaaaaay understated legolas and gimli are made into nothing more than his stooges who look assuringly at him whenever he has doubt frodo sam gollum on the other hand give great performances and are the only bright spot of the film although i think sheloub was a huge disappointment and did not live up to the hype preceding the film the ghost army looks like scooby doo animators drew it and the action scenes involving them are all wide sky shots where you cant see what is going on the multiple endings are also a plod along as the movie stops starts stops starts and finally comes to a end long after i was ready to leave the movie just overall disappointed me greatlynegative,how long was this awful film almost 4 hours the last 30 minutes were really taking the mickey in no uncertain terms the ring gets destroyed thats it movie over we really dont need to see sam & frodo get saved by eagles or them return to hobbiton or see bilbo & frodo leave with the elves does that even happen in the book the end of the film drags on far too long also the build up to the 2 main big battles drags on far too long as well if you are going to adapt a very long novel learn from frank herberts dune which originally was 8 hours long when dino delaurentis shot it dont bothernegative,i saw this movie when it first came out in the movie theaters it was the first movie i seriously considered walking out of up to that point in my life i had never fidgeted so much in a movie i blame the director his pacing was so ponderous that the story seemed to go on and on and i could hardly wait for it to be over the whole godfather series is vastly overratednegative,after hearing about this legendary film i decided it was about time i watched itafter about an hour i really wished i hadnt wasted the money renting itafter the movie finished i was bored the film was nothing like i had expected and i dont know how it possibly made it as big as it has it was quite well cast i love diane keaton but shes better in woody allens comedys than in this derivitive movie you want a good gangster moviewatch goodfellasit actually has a good story entertaining characters & violence and paints a much more realistic picture of the mob world of the era im not even going to bother watching parts 2 or 3 of the godfather coz marlon brando aint even in them so their aint much point i think ill go watch marlon brandos greatest performanceguys n dollsnegative,if i could give this film a negative 10 it would not begin to describe how horrible it is there is little to no plot the story never resolves and it jumps around in time and sequence so much that it is impossible to make any sense out of it i fail to see why so many people actually like this film and why it continues to get great reviews the only thing this film offers is a lot of graphic violence and blood throughout the entire movie the only thing that quentin tarantino is good for when you finally do reach the end you find yourself wondering why in the world you just wasted so much time time that could have been better spent cleaning your sock drawernegative,i saw rotk yesterday and its undoubtly the best lotr movie peter jackson is a genius and i really hope he wins an academy award for best director as always some goofs can be found but who cares the patient waiting is over because this great movie has finally been released and now some words about the actors elijah wood frodo played his part tremendously well but one cant really call him the star of this movie even though he carries the ring which he eventually destroys sean astin samwise played a much interesting character and i hope he gets nominated for his role merry and pippin played by dom monaghan and billy boyd are also two very funny characters they have a very strong friendship and dom & billy really show that on screen my guess is that it will be lotr time at the 76th academy awards in march 2004negative, after having seen how pulp fiction has infiltrated its way into current pop culutre the dance contest royale with cheese etc i finally got a chance to see the movie from the beginning and couldnt believe what a huge letdown it was there was nothing for me to grasp to make me care about what the characters were doing and why they were doing it and the overly gratuitous use of the f bombs put me off completely its almost as if swearing was substituted for wit and clever dialogue i felt like tarantino was trying to impress me with how much of a movie geek he is but if he tried to make a movie with an engaging story i might have liked it more the only person hes impressing is himself and it isnt working negative,i could not maintain concentration throughout that film when i heard it was on i had high expectations but i was throughly disappointed with how boring it was i cant see how it was so good its just a load of italians in america killing others so boring i decided not to watch the last hour i will admit that the scene where the police captain and the drug guy was shot was quite good the uncertainty of whether the gun is there or not is well produced and the effect with the white noise sounding like blood rushing through your ears was much more effective than the lame heart beats that you get it some filmsnegative,this movie is junk ive watched it twice i honestly dont see what people see in this garbage acting okay storyline garbage and predictable ive seen this exact movie in 3 other totally different movies its not original its an overrated thing just like breaking bad game of thrones the kardashians and celebrity babies this is garbage at its stinkys pulp fiction pulp reality dont judge something on what other people think at the end of the day watch itread itplay itbuy it you have the power dont listen to me watch it you can be the judge the movie isnt my favorite it sure isnt the worse its definitely not the best its overrated and transformers is betternegative,stupid movie already slightly better than the first 2 installations at least we did not sleep for more than an hour during the show and caught the ending whats the fuss about these movies spectacular views well why not take a tour in australia and experience the views first handnegative,lets value it entertainment the script is more than clich‹© typical prison break escape movie morgan freeman is ok tim robins is so awful in every scene he looks like he is crying production value is so so rating 3 10 social message the message of the movie is life is good society is fair enoughwhen it is unfairdont worry look at the down syndrome looking guy andywith a probably below average intelligence easily escaped the prison when you get caught do the samethe world is so wonderful and hopefuland american jails have better life than many other poor countries free lifetry a littleyou can do anythingthe message is complete wrong rating 5 10 objectionable things generally nothing serious objectionable to me but its a bit black supremacist it promotes typical black saintmagic negro image tells you blacks are morally superior than other people it violates my principal that people are equal rating 5 10 so overall rating 1 10negative,the movie is as bad if aleksandr nevsky directed it it would be very very wonderful your tarantino is no talent he is in a shadow of aleksandr nevsky his movies are not badass nor funny aleksnadr nevskys movies are actiony good sotry and good jokes the movie has not script it was directed on the go tarantino no scirpt means bad business i thought the movie is gonna be as beautiful as treasure hunters by aleksandr nevksy but it is no no no no just very really no avoid your spending time of life on this garbage go and watch aleksandr nevskys movies they are very underrated pulp fiction is overrated because tarantino is no aleksandr nevsky i know good you know badnegative,ok first of all i saw this a little while ago and i dont see how anybody could like this film except for the stars john travolta samuel l jackson uma thurman peter greene bruce willis and ving rhames the plot is all messed around and unorganized making it very difficult to understand the characters are all technically bad guys like i said the only good thing this film has to offer is the acting overall the film makes very little sense the way it is told the characters are all unlikable i really believe that if any film should get rated way lower than a 0 out of ten this is it i mean just how it got as high as an 89 out of 10 is beyond me id continue on ranting about how bad the story is written but this film just isnt worth anymore time please if youre wanting to see a great crime film go watch goodfellas1990 and if you want to go see a good action film go watch the hunted2003 this film rated from me is only a 1 out of 10 since it did have many famous and good actors but mars attacks is way better and that was a comedy filmnegative,before ram gopal verma conquered the gangster genre with satya and companybefore mahesh manjrekhars vaastav there was the ultimate gangster moviequentin tarantinos pulp fiction unfortunately whilst parinda was a hit satya and vaastav were even bigger hits and pulp fiction got almost forgotten tarantino had made one or two offbeat movie before this but he really hit it big time with pulp fiction it was released in 1994 to moderate success what really works for this movie is its restrained style most bollywood gangster movies i have seen are light on content and high on action pulp fiction doesnt have many overly long drawn out action sequences but what it offers is a great story and subtlety pulp fiction tells the story of four friendsjohn travolta his elder samuel l jackson harvey keitel and harvey willis this movie was the turning point in the fanciful world of hollywood which had so far kept the remotest possible distance from reality in order to provide a fantasy escape to people amidst poverty and underdevelopment hollywood in this respect had always feared compromising with colors glycerin scenic places superman feats dances and pomp and pageantry lest the movies would become insipid and turn off the masses coincidentally rd burmans last  before his demise was on tarantinos next venture er tv series pulp fiction is the best gangster movie to come out of bollywood or hollywood and deserves more appreciation from lovers of indian cinema highly recommended by menegative,the third lord of the rings movie was absolutely painful to watch even worse than the second one it had me cringing and groaning all the way through and not because of any empathy for the characters but simply because the acting the scripting and the everything was so so so so stupid and that is quite the word i was looking for beauty and the beast arwen makes me so mad for appearing at all the wrong times and far too frequently its all very well to say directors privilege to change parts of the novel and all right im fine with that privilege but it can be taken too far arwen only appears twice throughout the books and her character is only established in the appendix j r r tolkien is most likely turning in his grave or at least frowning furiously from afar as he watches these mutilations of his wonderful trilogy and when denethor jumped off the pyre i almost died laughing and i dont think that was the reaction peter jackson was aiming for ah well disappointment comes in all shapes and sizes and the biggest disappointment of my life came in the form of a movie called the return of the king negative, if there was a zero out of 10 thats what id give it i know so many people hear the movie title the godfather and automatically feel like praising that movie that whole trilogy to the high heavens well i dont care if it was made wellapart from how it was made the movie was bad and im still upset that my philosophy teacher made me suffer through the whole trilogy boringslowjust plain snooze ville im probably going to have an angry mob coming after me for speaking of the movie this way but its my opinionand im sure im not alone in feeling this way negative, firstly i wish to say that i think the dark knight is a very good movie as an average batman fan i think that this version of the batman chronicles balances artful pathos with run of the mill mainstream icons and themes secondly my goal is to make a brief point that this film has no place in the top 10 movies of all time thirdly and lastly in order to make my point i would like you to review the top 10 list below 1 the shawshank redemption 1994 455891 2 91 the godfather 1972372101 3 90 the godfather part ii 1974 218313 4 89 il buonoil brutto il cattivo 1966 137484 5 89 pulp fiction 1994372926 6 88 schindlers list 1993 247064 7 88 one flew over the cuckoos nest 1975 190056 8 88 12 angry men 1957 100190 9 88 the dark knight 2008 403372 10 88 star wars episode v the empire strikes back 1980 now ask yourself the question does the dark knight belong in this list i do not think it does my opinion i do not think that the the dark knight meets the basic criteria of character development and story plot dialog quality it is a 2 dimensional action film that wants to nick the surface of character development but fails to meet the challenge negative,the worst film i have seen this year its so boring i think it got good reviews because heath ledger died and that was a tribute to him batman is crap the joker is average the first batman with jack nicholas as the joker is 1000 times better that was excellent this was dire and boring beware batman fans are just going over the top for this heap of rubbish the film is so predictable because you know what happens i think that gadgets were not that good and the actors were not that good i was expecting this to be great but as with all films with far too much hype i was waiting for the good bit after an hour i was still waiting after 2 i thought this is so dull and it wasnt going anywhere i love good films eg iron man lord of rings indianna jones shawshank redemption star wars this is a classic by no meansnegative, this movie was trying to be many things at once between the cheesy gordons lines and a gangster movie wannabe they really lost a lot of the essence they build in the first movie first of all batman is supposed to be a superhero in my opinion they should have focused in getting a mix of spiderman which made superheroes movies popular again with the kind of asian mystery and wise character they created in the first movie now you just see a guy that can do no wrong where you are supposed to be awed by his sacrifices see the problem is that if you want to create a believable gangster movie good guys have legitimate reasons to kill bad guys sometimes and they pretty much have to unless they are a priest or something remember the departed thats what you have to focus on if you want good drama they could complement that with what the new hulk movie the one with edward norton achieved and then we could have a fantastic movies with one of the greatest comic characters of all time as far as the acting goes i dont see what all the fuzz is all about with the joker watch no country for old men and tell me who you are really scared of afterwards and no makeup required on top of that negative,wow i love this movie to date i have probably watched it nearly 40 times i am not obsessive whenever it is on i watch it for most movies at least the dramatic ones i measure them based on how they make me feel this one makes me feel sad when brooks dies angry when tommy dies and happy when red finds his friend this movie makes me feel good i know that is not very scientific but its the truth because of the way it plays on me i cant help but give it a 10 heres why first off the acting tim robbins is so subtle that he strikes me as a person that tries to bury his innocence because in reality it does not matter few would argue that morgan freeman is brilliant as usual but here the supporting cast throws in with equally impressive performances the  outside the music from the records appearing in the movie the relatively unrestrictive  just helps us confirm what our eyes see the walls of shawshank we feel them through the music and break through them as andy does and last but not least my compliments on the cinematography the site is perfect for the movie and the clever camera angles and lighting invite us into the dreary prison world just the joke dnegative,people wonder why i hate this movie so much and i have to say that its just purely unoriginal i mean cmon how many times have you heard the story of a guy whos wrongfully accused of a crime and somehow escapes prison using a stupid spoon if theres one thing i look for in a movie then its got to be originality ill let it go if its based on a novel or a musical but cmon a plot this unoriginal doesnt deserve any creditnegative, i would humbly suggest that before praising or damning the shawshank redemption that one take a considered look at the new york times best 1000 films ever made list unfortunately the guidelines of this site preclude meoh gentle reader from giving you the url one should be able to google it so all is not lost the nyt was good enough to excerpt the list from peter nichols the new york times guide to the 1000 best films ever made what the shawshank redemption is not on this list you say perhaps humble viewer you havent seen enough films of the first rank but have no fear this is a remediable condition but be a dear and do try to see some of the movies on the listplease before voting on this site i really hate to see so many people make the mistake of voting for the wrong sort of movies onto the top 10 of imdbs very interesting site its ever so declasse remember an educated public is an informed public now do your part negative,this drama has been widely vaunted as one of the best films ever made personally i just cant see the appeal sure it contains very good performances by tim robbins and morgan freeman but there have been other much better screen performances by other actors there is very little suspense or originality about the plot and nothing that hasnt been seen or done on screen a hundred times before so why the popularity its a formulaic feel good movie whos happy ending is never in doubt knowing that stephen king wrote the novel on which the film was based would probably give that away anyway as with any adaptation from book to film there are several differences between the two though the film does on this occasion improve on the book there have been better adaptations of king novels the shining and better performances by better actors yet for some reason this film continues to be rated as better than it actually isnegative,this movie was so hyped for no reason and so boring everyone i talk to told me that it was ok but kind of boring this is the same answer i get from people i dont even know now that i think about it know its kind of like breaking bad someone said it was great so everyone else saids it two beuase they heard the talk from one source it was interesting but dont watch it if your kind of tired it will put you right to sleep just like breaking bad if you have sleeping problems breaking bad and this movie are the cure and i still think even though the 90 batmans are stuipd they are close to the comic books that we all read unlike this movie which is the exact thing and who ever said dark is realistic i live in arizona its bright all the time maybe in alaska that would be realistic in my lifetime there are nothing but colors that surround me so who ever said that is a idiot negative,first of all i must say that when the new batman project was announced i had good memories and the best expectations i watched eagerly on the big screen batman begins as long the movie was reeling forward my enthusiasm was reeling back boring lot of good actors lost on a non coherent story and then the end credits i didnt doubt for a second that maybe i was too much attached to the burtons ones that probably with beetlejuicescissorhands and nightmare beforeare his best movies as director because later he lost his magic the three movies from this new revamp are overrated and totally waste the chance to really bring the dark knight into a fresh and mature path lot of money wasted on nothing the plots are bold and the actors wasted the nolan touch in my opinion overrated ruins this saga the same as the inception film and the supermans revamping unless in marvel they try to be close to their comics to maintain the spirit cause one good thing about the comics is that the script is already done not need to change much just adapt it visually to the big screen no more no less mario puzo can teach nolan how to write a serious superheros movie i know almost everyone high rates this saga but with the same theory everybody loves junk food and it doesnt mean its nutritious or healthynegative, peter jackson who is talented at one thing and one thing only spectacle finishes his hugely successful trilogy im so glad this less than mediocre hack was given the job of writing and directing the film adaptations of the some of the best written fantasy literature ever the innacuracy of the story shoddy pacing inconsistent characterization via poorly written dialogue and hugely misunderstood character relationships and statuses are the largest sins committed in this film but the problem goes deeper this is just another in a long line of films quite nicely summed up by the word blockbuster and quite nicely critiqued by the trio may it rip documentary the blockbuster imperative in which the course of popular culture is outlined as a quest for and to quench the thirst for excitement rather than enrichment thank you peter jackson for shitting on the world you are so over rated it hurts me and your movies will never stand the test of time negative, normally i dont read comments from others before a movie but now i did cause i was wondering why this movie got such a high rating a lot of people say its fantastic and i read some people who really hated it im not a bat man fan though i had bat toys as a kid a long time ago so i went in pretty open minded i still dont know why this movie got such a high rating i fell asleep 2 times during it ok im a bit tired lately but a good movie sure keeps me awake the story is kinda lame the classical batman story is good versus bad pretty simple and straightforward but the writers chose to abandon this theme more or less stating that good will always turn to evil given enough time yea sounds pretty deep but isnt go read nietzsche i found it all pretty predictable and where it wasnt it was too far fetched to ever be realistic it leans on the psychology angle to pressure people to chose bad over good kinda like saw and others but not as good as that actually that theme gets worn out pretty fast the pace seems way off in the beginning i was like huh whats all happening going way too fast other passages are too slow prolly where i fell asleep the art of telling a story any story is to take the listener or viewer along for the ride with all possible means this just doesnt happen its not the worst movie ever but surely not the best either the acting is pretty ok freeman and caine always deliver batman obviously has a cold as soon as he puts his cape on or watched darth vader too often and replicates it as a 10 year old the joker is totally not funny and where he should portray the madness the only thing he knows to show is to stick his tongue out periodically didnt find him scary at all not funny nor interesting they nominated the guy for an oscar the only reason i can think of why that is is cause hes dead im not saying his acting is bad but its by far not that good you either die a hero or live to become a villain has to be made true by awarding a posthumous oscar effects and stunts are ok but nothing new or exiting all in all its doable but i wouldnt recommend it to anyone over ~13 gave it a 5 cause its not all bad maybe i just outgrew batman no were not destined to do this forever and in fact before redoing a batman you need a really good angle on it so think twice negative,it was a good movie but it wasnt as spectacular or amazing as everyone has been saying it would be you should see this in the cinemas but only because the quality of the film just wouldnt be there if you got it out on dvd not a good film for the children good for teenagers adults and anyone familiar with the batman franchise if you have not seen the first movie then there are several places in the dark knight where you will get a bit confused as they add in references and it is assumed you have seen the first film end result see it in the movies before you go watch batman returns try not to read reviews done by professional film critics as that could ruin the movie for younegative,i have not been able to get over more than 15 minutes of this movie despite several attempts due to the fact that everybody is always so keen on pulp fiction i suppose the trick must lie somewhere after these 15 minutes but it is rare to see such uninteresting characters two otherwise so great actors really chat for such an incredibly long time without any sense in their dialog at all i simply cant get beyond that initial quarter of an hour even with fast forwarding why is everyone so frantic about this film i felt i simply had to comment on this movie so as to somewhat spoil the in my opinion undeservedly excellent ratingnegative,why ill tell you why this is my opinion first of all i cant believe its in top five of all times this is unbelievable and i think even the producer is surprised of the position of his movie im just asking you to think about what major revolutions the movie has brought first of all the story was already used in a previous moviethe lord of the rings 1978 the special effects are great but what about the matrix the music and the costumes are great but this is ordinary for a movie with that budget and the plot is for kidslets face it with no passion or feelings etc just the old war between good and evil witch is present in any jean claude van damme or stallone movie im very sad not because the world is insane about the movie because the movie is in top 5 of all times so they leaving me no chance but to vote the movie with 1negative,look i understand how many people love this film good acting pretty solid storyline etc but one thing that is also a factor is what generation of movie audiences it is geared toward i am a teenager and while i do love guns killing and all that good teenage stuff that is in this movie many people of my generation do not take such interest in mafia thrillers i feel that they are a thing of the past and therefor i do not identify with this movie in the slightest and basically dont love it as much as many people seem to having said this i actually liked goodfellas more then the godfather not because of the mafia ties but the struggles that the man character underwent struggles that i can identify with this was something the godfather lacked again its not bad its just ok negative,this whole movie is empty really empty im not saying every movie has to give message cos i dont believe in that but this so called masterpiece seems to be about nothing events are unconnected what is uma thurmans characters almost dying has to do with the bruce willis boxer storyline whats boxer storyline has to do with the main characters or why is there a boxer it all seems unnecessary now please tell me how this work of art can described as masterpiece because of the directing famous soundtrack or acting i can say ok to all that but this movie only contains unconnected events characters and has no main storyline and we dont know what this is about i can hardly say tarantino is a big director i cant call a man full of emptiness and bullst a master his only film i like is kill bill which surprisingly different from this garbages has a main storyline nows where to going and i can only name kill bill a masterpiecenegative,i enjoyed the movie until the last scene when they decided to hide the truth about harvey it really change my opinion about the movie because what i care about is the purpose the main idea the solution offered in this movie is very bad showing this idea in public in the cinema as a good idea is the worst thing to do hiding the truth is something that keeps destroying our faith in each other our trust in the closest people to us its destroying the societies all around the world in every nation its something we should fight and not encourage so what if the white knight couldnt keep his word he is a human being and part of being a human being is making mistakes i think there is a lot better end for this movie an idea that completes the greatness of the story and the show the white kngiht falls and feel sorry about it he lives and serves time while writing a book about ideals and about how the man loses himself that book will encourage another lawman to become the next white knight who learned from the mistakes of harvey this way the next movie will be about the adventures of the new white knightnegative,either someone stuffed the ballot box on this one or people are merely voting for an icon without really thinking about it this movie does not even remotely deserve its reputation there is no significant character development it is too long and thats an understatement and in quite a few places the plot drags interminablynegative,i found this movie really boring i am sure it was great when it first came out but it just doesnt have a lot of substance to it marlon brando comes off as just plain annoying talking like a retard throughout it also what little action there is comes off as boring way too long for its own good but al pacino did play his part well i prefer goodfellas over this any day its much more face paced and witty  i found this movie really boring i am sure it was great when it first came out but it just doesnt have a lot of substance to it marlon brando comes off as just plain annoying talking like a retard throughout it also what little action there is comes off as boring way too long for its own good but al pacino did play his part well i prefer goodfellas over this any day its much more face paced and wittynegative,this movie is like football people only watch it because the think its cool or popular but really it is the most dreary repetitive and slow film i have had the displeasure in viewing how this film grew to be such a great i do not know bu ti know that it shouldnt be shawshank redemption may not deserve to be second best film ever but at least it is worthy of being where it is and is certainly a better film than any of the godfathers so please consider this when voting the godfather is poorly directed badly scripted crudely acted and most importantly is quite frankly boring and wearisomenegative,jim kunsler is not a regular film critic he is an accomplished published author and highly educated in arts and literature i subscribe to his blog usually for his political writing there are hardly any film critics around the newspaper magazine internetzimdb & tv folks are just reviewers as opposed to critics they mumble about good or bad thumbs up how much money is involved and other nonsense in what is an ignorant parody of consumer reports as if the art of film were a microwave oven or brand of toilet tissue in writing about the incredibly popular movie the dark knight kunsler has actually written a piece of film criticism he puts the film in the context of our present national and international culture economy and values you can see what jim kunsler has done at his website http wwwkunstlercom you can read his blog entries at http tinyurlcom 6acfvgnegative, having negative opinions about this film does not constitute trolling as defined by wikipedia the film was entertaining but was arguably worse than other batman films from the past there appeared to be a shift from the comic book hero being the main protagonist to the joker being the main character the purpose of such a film had more to do with the marketing of the film within the controversy of and blatant exploitation the actor heath ledgers death this has lead to arguably and debatable claims about ledgers performance in the film this is understandable as his fans will not tolerate any negativity with regards his performance as a result this message board is dominated by those who totally dismiss the great performance of other batman villains such as danny de vito as the penguin and the list is long there as has been some very intelligent comments detailing how this film veers from the comic book hero upon which it is based to a dark cop film none the less the film is a hit and ledger fans expect heath ledgers role as the joker to earn an oscar and go down as the greatest performance of an actor in the history of film i personally believe that heath ledgers and christopher nolans interpretation of the joker a bit too morbid but none the less effective as a villain overall the film was contrived and formulated and the script was a bit dodgy as far as story line but so are all comic book hero films i thought christian bales performance as batman was great but the digitally enhanced voice effect made him seem too dark a knight in fact judging by this forum one would think that batman was now the villain and the joker was the great good guy it was far from being a great film and eventually the hysteria from the more juvenile minds will subside and the film will fade into the esoteric world of the batman collector negative,i dont know what film i saw but i know i wasted 152 mins of my life theres virtually nothing positive about this film perhaps its the over hyped thats ruined an average film the film obviously suffered from the loss of heath ledger though its unclear at what point in the filming this happened if at all maybe its just been terribly scripted and badly edited theres no suspense every idea in the film has been seen before i think the whole cinema sat in disbelief in how bad this film is at the end there was only relief that it had finished caine is superbly cast as alfred bale lacks from a poor script and a empty storyline which is a shame because batman begins was pretty good film maybe this film appeals the american audience but on the opening night at my local cinema in n london 99% of people walked out very disappointednegative,after i was done watching this movie i was sitting there waiting for it to begin there was no story there was nothing for viewers to hope to happen or not to happen unbearably trite performances all around can morgan freeman play anything other than morgan freeman i was waiting for the scene when he tells batman that he is really god and that batman has to be god for a day ie batman almighty were given no reason to care about anything that happens to any of the characters this was a classic example of weak screen and story writing covered up by special effects explosions and other eye candy the only thing redeeming about it was some decent ambiance and directing but in that regard it did not live up to batman begins nolan is past the point in his career where he has something to prove the love is gone and its showing in a big way the batmobile was fun to watch but that hardly makes a movie please look past the special effects and give this movie the rating it deserves make nolan and other film makers do more than throw gobs of money at ilm to make a movienegative,is this what now passes for entertainment can this really be compared for depth and breadth with other generally highly rated movies such as the godfather casablanca or even star wars many of the imdb top movies deal with the good old battle between good and evil and the world weariness of the hero or anti hero but this film lands far short of the mark in both character and plot development not to mention script acting screenplay or any of the other attributes of a movie that might be worthy of commendation the purity of the comic book origins of this piece are thoroughly distorted and turned into an incoherent muddle almost any james bond movie has a great deal more tension humour conviction and morality than this mess of a movie on the other hand if theres a serious message in the dark knight i missed it as i suspect will thousands of others as a batman flick it simply doesnt deliver anything like the expectations at yet another level as a post 9 11 human condition search for identity movie it also fails however you want to see it it fails on a grandiose scale for some of who do not live in the in the us the dark knight has the potential to appear as little more than an appalling piece of hyped up propaganda for a moribund social policy that permits and legitimises evil mayhem and general wrongdoing and unpleasantness on a colossal scale in the pursuit of defeating the threats against society ive had more fun at the cinema studying the architecturenegative,this film wasnt awful it was pretty decent but the rating isnt for the film itself but as a counter to all those who have over rated it were it not for the exaggerated response to the movie through peoples want to have seen something great rather than to have actually witnessed it then a rating of 6 feels right film is over long doesnt sufficiently build characters to the point where we care what happens to them relies heavily on shocks crashes bangs and gadgets and is probably best suited to teenage boys who are already batman fans spiderman and batman the original were better movies and this feels more like james bond without the humour than a standout classicnegative,im going to have to be brief because i hate this movie so much 1 the joker is too invincible he is so invincible he can drive a bus out of a public place rig a hospital and two boats and no one notices also everyone he comes in contact with even teenagers want to work for him even though he will kill them once needed 2 pointless characters lao should have been written out of the film he adds nothing and amounts to nothing pointless the guy who knows who batman is goes no where and his character only amounts to a stupid explosion 3 breaks the main rule of cinema the protagonist defeats the antagonists there are two main villains in this movie and batman doesnt defeat either one 4 harveys motivation in the end i hated harvey through out the film but once hes two face he just becomes dumb he believes that people should have a 50 50 chance like rachel though thats not what happened gordan was just late so now hes going to and kill gordans son there are other problems but those are the most major and i can not believe instead of noticing these problems people and went and gave it #8 on the top 250negative, i went to see this movie with no expectations at all because im not a fan of batman and big budget hollywood movies usually disappoint me although i think this movie is totally overrated i liked the joker character played by heath ledger and the story was ok too the film itself was week in my opinion it depended too much on the action and it didnt deserve to be titled the dark knight at all tim burtons batman was much more dark in my opinion and there was more of an artistic element to it while tdk was just an action movie despite of all i completely understand why people like it this movie has enough action and special effects to entertain most people and a pretty good story for an action movie but i certainly think that it doesnt deserve to be third in imdb top250 negative, damn i cant believe the reviews for this film ive only seen this twice and dont plan on seeing it again anytime soon and this coming from a lifelong batman movie fan note the emphasis on movie not comicsive seen the original film 200000 times and i loved all the sequels even the campy schumacher ones but boy did they take this franchise in a reverse direction just because batman & robin was terrible and silly doesnt make christopher nolans films the comic book equivalent of the godfather or gone with the frigging wind if anything they only show how amazing tim burtons 2 original dual pictures are and how utterly lame the nolan ones are not only is the dark knight worse then batman begins its downright ridiculous you feel like you need a degree in law to understand what the hell they are talking about its like csi meets gotham city you might as well call this movie gcpd or gcpd blue or any of those law and order type shows that this movie seems to copy from its even more silly when you look at the lengths the director went through to make this batman movie as boring as possible they seem to think if the story is engaging enough we dont have to make the movie visually appealing thats like saying if the story is good enough we dont have to make batman look awesome in the comics lets get this review started shall we first the joker we are all familiar im sure with jack nicholsons classic portrayal from the original film it was truly amazing he made the character eerie funny and charming all at once yet he seemed to understand that this character is based off cartoons and as such you cant take yourself all that seriously this is the complete opposite of what heath ledger does with the same role but i guess you cant really blame the actor entirely with nolan wanting to change up batman and his world to the point that the characters arent really who they should be first off joker doesnt fall in a vat of acid like the original he puts on makeup and cuts his own smile and dyes his hair green i would hate to see his joker in the rain he would look rather pathetic as a joker i can guarantee that if nicholson didnt already do this classic comics origin 20 years ago in the awesome first film fan boys would be crying that joker was turned into common serial killer done a million times over in other films and not the funny amusing comic book clown prince of crime that everyone is more familiar with oh but since nicholson already played that version to perfection nolan was somehow able to get away with turning joker into a common killer that weve seen time and again heath didnt really even play the•ÈÀ joker he played generic serial killer bad guy #13314 for those who would defend ledger by saying he was really scary and terrifying sure ill give them that but to say he was better than nicholson jack freaking nicholson pleeeeeeeeeease the role was virtually made for the man when he was born•ÈÀ nicholson captured the true essence of the joker a psychopathic man child out not to prove a good damn thing but to kill and mess around with people all for the laughs these are traits that define the joker not some clich‹© ideal of wanting people to accept that evil exists in all of us and that brings me to another point whats with this jokers anarchist pseudo philosophic rambling monologues boy nolan loves these cardboard deep monologues he has his character spew out all the time even in the last film its laughable at how serious he takes the movie did he forget this is based off of comic books and that there are supposed to be fun elements in the film tim burton struck the perfect balance of comic book and reality its somewhere right in the middle nolan puts a guy in a bat suit and places him right in middle of an unaltered real life city it makes him look silly and out of place im not gonna dwell much on bales batman this guy cant save any movie hes in people seem to love this guy or think hes some brilliant actor but hes obviously just a wooden actor and once again phoned in his performance in this film to quote christopher walken from batman returns hes just a poor schmo who got lucky his batman voice is ludicrous ludicrous i still dont understand why they decided to make batman sound like an engine turning over every time he talks he makes me laugh the only decently done things in this film is how harvey dent is portrayed pre twoface and the pretty nifty bat pod that has one cool scene in which it bursts from the bat mobile but again the action scenes never pick up because of nolans hard on for realism so nothing in the new batman films ever makes you go ooh awesome for too long this movie just dragged and i remember looking at the clock as to when it would end they make it feel like the new batmans are smart but honestly in a comic book movie who the heck wants to listen to all this law and order talk and long drawn out deep monologues its someh id rather watch jack nicholson laugh like a maniac shooting his henchman and making me laugh who can forget gems like bob gun today you have why so serious yeah thats what i want to know why so serious nolan why cant you make batman fun nothing against having darkness burtons films were dark too but not so much to the point where they werent fun or exciting again disappointed negative,from where to start maybe from my disappointment with imdb and vote engine or just leave that and straight go to the description of this movie 1 bad directingup up up in tension and then totally down with low intelligent denouement 2 bad script too much talkingt non stop talking superheros and villains talking all the time everything must be explained 3 joker performance is nothing more than little above mediocre im counting this in list because so much talking in public about awesome performance by ledgerwell maybe if you didnt watch any film with al pacinoif you just put attention to it you will see legder is trying the best to act like al pacino in talking scenes 4 too much slow and heart breakingyeah lordoftherings scenes 5 film is next elections campaing nothing more and film have few good things to be honest 1 music is great pumping tension whole film 2 masks are very good2face mask is perfect short this film in top ten alltime movies bahnegative, i already wrote a review on the dark knight being full of anger and antipathy for that movie but now i realized that the best thing to do is help others to make a decision whether that praised film will awesomely entertain or simply shock them ill forbear from spoilers the dark knight wasnt the movie i expected i thought it would be like batman begins where people had motives for deeds and still surprising moments where batman was a troubled character finding his way back to psychological stability dealing with obstacles and fighting hard never to corrupt his morals it wasnt considered soberly the dark knight was a complete surprise it said the journeys not over and it will not end where you expect it to end moreover and thats also announced in the movie the main villain has no motives hes simply evil loves to hurt and corrupt people and is differently to what he proclaims not a chaotic person but an organizing and planning genius almost or i believe definitely able to foresee the future and heres the lack of the film the joker is unbeatable whatever batman and the police try the cannot defeat him hes like a mythological god of chaos owed to the writers corrupting people with i have to admit known but corrupting dilemma situations and thats quite hard to bear if youre a sensitive person youll sit there and suffer if youre sensitive and intellectual youll simply understand that movie as a nightmare and you should take that literally because if you are its an unpleasant annoying or even fierce situation with ‰ÛÒ what you call ‰ÛÒ logic taken away so if youre wondering whether to watch and youre a person like me who believes that a movie either has to be realistic or if fiction has to contribute to giving you a good feeling or being a better person or something like that do not watch that movie you will go out and have to deal with a serious quarrel about these i believe fake teachings you saw in that movie for all the others please take my advice i have to admit that i am maybe a bit too sweet tempered or something but please dont take that movie too serious in movies the too positive ones i often caught myself believing what happened there without reflecting please do not do that here its a negative movie destroying the super hero legend having been established in batman begins surrendering to the believe that anyone can be corrupted and will be corrupted unless they die first thanks for reading negative,im not going to comment on individual performances or technical aspects these are covered elsewhere what made tdk a disappointment for me was the loss of story halfway through in the beginning there are enough coherent scenes strong supporting cast and even flashes of brilliance to tempt you into sticking with this latest episode in the comic book as film noir franchise but tdk loses any sense of scale the story leaves you high and dry it loses any relation it had to an engaging story of complex supeheroes and ‹_bervillains and becomes an unnecessarily complicated overwrought overstuffed mess the film becomes like a nightmare fairground where all the sideshows are at full volume in your face and all of them drowning each other out in the hope that you wont notice that none of them are very interesting at all just like that mobile phone multiscreen towards the long distant end which doesnt make sense as a plot device as a technical gizmo or as anything that one operator could make head ot tail of minority report had a similar imaginary device that looked believable this wasnt even in the post luc besson design world tdk is supposed to inhabit the point where tdk quite literally loses the plot is when da dent is switched to become two face which would naturally be the point where you would expect the movie to end except that the joker isnt anywhere near being dealt with at that point so tdk has to carry on with a completely new villain in order to resolve the story of the old villain and it doesnt do that properly either in all tdk is like half a good film with a bad one tacked on the end loaded with flashes and bangs in the hope you wont noticenegative,even for a blockbuster cotton candy movie this is a piece of crap got a script that makes so sense characters that you dont care about and mindless violence and unbelievable set pieces how do you know the joker is a guy that just likes to see things burn why first alfred tells us that and if you didnt get it the first time the joker then tells us he just likes to see things burn and sure enough if that was too subtle for you he then sets things on fire then there is the fact that keep on calling him a terrorist when he goes on about how he only care about chaos first of all a terrorist is a person who acts because they do have a strong belief not because they have no beliefs terrorist do the things they do with a goal in mind they are in fact the total opposite of the joker character then you have a film thats basic message is hey sometimes its ok to lie and pretend someone is a hero when they arent wow what a wonderful things to support im sure george w bush loved this film then there is the acting how hard is it to play completely crazy not that damn hard just because health ledger is dead doesnt mean his acting is suddenly good he was not a great actor and he sure isnt in this film too long so boringnegative,my lack of faith in the audience is justified how can this film be so highly rated when its total garbage batman was my favourite comic book the dark tortured hero really appealed to me but this film really is a mess where do i begin probably the biggest problem of any bad movie the characters batman the one were supposed to identify with and feel his plight is so wooden in this film that i could mistake him for a tree christian bales batman seems devoid of any emotion or any internal plight plus in a film that is supposed to be about him batman seems relegated to a supporting role in tdk hes merely a goon with a bad case of laryngitis i know hes supposed to disguise his voice but its so over the top its laughable this is were keaton and conroy got it right he seldom talks when he does the voice change is subtle not sounding like a goon on a sugar high the joker the main villain heath ledgers performance is good with what hes given but the writing for the joker is all wrong joker in this film is actually a very generic psychopath if it wasnt for the make up i would have never guessed it was supposed to be the joker the joker isnt supposed to be a nihilist everything to him is a big joke even murder has to be funny to him ledgers joker lacking virtually any sense of humour hes more akin to jack the ripper who seems to have an obsession with knives and scars also what put me off is how the joker always looks physically ill constantly hunched over waddling about constantly licking and smacking his lips like his saliva is on overdrive this simply doesnt work for a clownish criminal amusing himself with the exceptions of michael caine and morgan freeman the actors in the film just seemed rather lazy like they wanted the film to end as quickly as possible and collect their pay cheque why in a film where characters are supposed to be the central focus be so wooden and one dimensional with them the film flops completely on its characters the directing was equally sloppy a lot of pointless noise and generic action scenes that seem to be put in as filler in order to extend the film to the 150 minute mark excessive cuts that make the action difficult to follow and often in poor light where we cant see anything equally pointless was the plot in fact its more a collection of subplots none of them with any closure or resolution to them with the sloppy cuts it also leaves enough plot holes to sink this film into an incoherent mess yet i hear this film heralded as a masterpiece i see critics and fan reviews who just gush over this film has the standard of film making really reached this low 20 years ago a film called robocop came out a very silly concept at its core but the characters are what made the film work we could identify with robocop ironically enoughtim burtons despite its plot flaws the characters were well created and acted and kept to the spirit of the source material tdk has no such redeeming featuresnegative,i first saw this movie when i rented it out from my local video store i can honestly say it is the worst movie i have ever seen it doesnt even deserve the right to be called a movie i am a big fan of episodes 1 and 2 and i wasnt really disappointed with 3 but empire strikes back is just horrible the acting is dreadful the bad guys arent scary of funny and arent even both guys the kid who plays luke skywalker is dreadful and your left hoping the bad guys actually get him and strangle him the storyline is just stupid and why they decided to keep the same characters as the first two home alones is beyond me overall i have to say this movie is a big disappointment and i only gave it the rating 1 because i had to if i could give it a zero i wouldnegative,spoilers frankly put this movie sucked what could have been spectacular with only a little care was ruined oh dont get me wrong if you are some lazy movie goer who considers yourself an expert because you own the extended editions of the first two movies on dvd you will certainly enjoy this movie if you are like me a hardcore fan who has practically memorized the books i dont see how you can enjoy this film it starts out fairly well and continues like that for most of the film although the changes are not usually welcome at all cite arwens magnified part to make it sappy or gollum and frodo leaving sam altogetheri could have accepted that sure shelobs lair was all wrong well yeah it did annoy me that at some parts aragorn was more important than the whole ring of power which must be destroyed the whole love triangle was blown way out of proportion and by editing out his almost death it might have been possible to film some of the wonderful scenes in the book that the movies carelessly deleted but like i said it was all right until the end the ring was destroyed magnificently i admit the aftermath was done well but there is no excuse for skipping straight to the happy ending lalala sunflowers and daisy chains and frolicking puppies for all what the just happened no scouring of the shire for that saruman just might have been left out altogether no adjustment for frodo i might also add that by having gollum and sam make so much external conflict for him it practically obliterates all the internal conflict the audience is unprepared and confused when he decides to keep the ring however back to the mangled ending put aside the major parts in an effort to appeal to teenage girls i assume the filmmakers decided to give arwen a much larger role and make eowyns affection for aragorn much more serious as well so why do they not bother showing her courtship with faramir a large part of the books is condensed into two camera shots of them standing beside each other at the coronation of glorious king aragorn who seems to have washed his hair for the occasion i know he was on a trek in the wilderness no shampoo but how come he shaved more then but back to eowyn her sudden attachment to faramir makes her seem like she is nothing but a man chaser first she goes after aragorn future king and current war hero when he spurns her love she takes faramir steward and war hero as the next best option ridiculous just ridiculous to sum up do not see this movie do not waste your money this review is long i know but it could be so much longer if i wanted to mention everything wrong with the movies anyone who is a true fan will regard this as nothing but filth a pure waste of timenegative,well this movie is not for people who like subtlety not for people who like good dialogues not for people who like interesting characters it is for people who love action action and nothing much else for people who love pompous battles on big screens hollow words rhetorics of of the kind great dictators are so fond of big words like today mankind will not fail sure i can see why people like this movie they are just easily pleased they see a big battle scene and theyre happy they see orcs orcs and still more orcs and they think wow these orcs must be metaphors for all the bad bad people that are out there on this evil evil planet how deep what geniuses are tolkien and peter jackson they see a helicopter view of a battlefield great graphics of a fictional city a realistic monster spider and theyre happy they see good triumph over evil and they think thats the way it should be because well uhm because its different from real life i guess it gives them uhm hope it must be nice to not see that cheap emotions the flat characters some of the most stereotyped dialogues ever written in the history of film it must be great to be able to love this movienegative, this would go down as one of the worst movie of the year an overhyped tale i havent read the book but after seeing the movie i will steer clear of anything to do with the lord of the rings the convinently call able ghost army made it the most anti climatic ending after the 6 8 hrs spent building the tension over the 3 movies it is the same as the anti climatic fight at helms deep when gandalf appears to save the day what was the purpose of the elves there were so many holes in the plot the emphasis that sam wise was not gay was sickening meant wasting 5 mins in the end showing he marries a woman and has 3 kids to make it more suitable to the times frodo and sam wise should have just come out of the closet it is a shame that people have voted it to become in the top 3 movies at imdb negative, happy 20th anniversary not did i watch the exact same movie which so many people have referred to and think its some holy pop cultural iconic movie i just dont get it and ill never get it to be honest i feel like calling this film stupid people going around doing stupid things  im not joking one thing after the other in this movie just confused me the entire time i was like huh everything about the story lines occurrences the dialogue and the pay off was just stupid and the f bomb is dropped in every other sentence so much so i felt like punching the screen in its said so much to the extent where it gets really annoying i like samuel l jackson especially for his stars wars and marvel superhero work but i dont care if hes mostly known for this i hate him playing such over the top nonsensical controversial characters and i hate films that just take advantage of even white washing the names of christians and have the bad guy quote bible verses thats dangerous its brainwashing & manipulation want my advice of a real christian is rachel scott of columbine who was killed for her faith dietrich bonhoeffer who spoke out against hitler and nazi germany or even dr kent hovind who reveals a lot of amazing scientific evidence for the fact of special creation and biblical accuracy all much better and meaningful then this overrated pile of worthless celluloid nothing though to be fair i think quentin does have an decent taste in soundtrack variety i admit ive got those songs on my ipod as a result of watching this flick and i do think the scene of christopher walkens watch talk does for some reason relax me simply because its simply walken his delivery & his way of talking is somewhat kind of relaxing and amusing all at once hes been interesting ever since i saw him in the comedy mousehunt though the scene still is stupid when the captain or general whatever curses at a young boy about the a$$ and how even a young boy would want such a filthy watch after being inside many mens anuses for a long time i mean tarantinos just some director i dont like or care about he claims hes against drugs and violence then dont make films about them you may be just condoning or giving ideas about drugs and violence youre definitely part of the hollyweird group arent you im all round just thank everything that is holy sacred and beneficial that i didnt see this film when i was younger 1994 definitely was the big year for many good movies but pulp fiction is certainly not one of them it shouldnt have even been nominated for anything not even best picture imo the lion king shouldve been nominated in its place instead a film thats all the more likable fun entertaining relatable family friendly and beautifully put together its art but guess not since hollyweird has got such a fetish for pure violence murder sexual immorality and biased anti christian propaganda pulp fiction is just painful to sit through tarantinos a hack and ive never liked or will ever like any of his filmsnegative,this movie is overrated and frankly sucks as a film it has very few elements of a good film and was toooooo long anyone can make a good movie in about four hours the trick is to stay under three hours and still have a forceful impact the movie had too many fronts there were frodo sam gollum aragorn dead people mary rohirran and gandalf pippin the movie is good entertainment if youre willing to sit long enough lotr freaks have kept giving this movie a 10 making a mockery of the voting no thought is actually being given during voting and personally i think people should just give it a one just to counteract the false votingnegative, this is not a movie deserving of an academy award sweep i remember watching it on opening night and seeing the audience confused about when to leave fanboys with staffs and fake beards got up a good twenty minutes before the final roll and then quickly sat down realizing that hey it aint done well it should have been i think that if you win an award for something it needs to be great at whichever aspect throughout the movie won for editing but it wasnt edited well throughout the direction wasnt anything to hoist high either i didnt find the acting dynamic in any way and if i see one more helicopter sweep of the mountains as our heroes run oh never mind oh and the giant arachnid was nice but some of the other special effects ugh nonetheless the series was impressive because the time it was turned around in but i dont think they needed to sacrifice quality for getting em out three christmas in a row some of the special effects in the final lava sequence looked like land of the lost for chrissakes so for those of you who want to argue that they deserved awards because of the daunting task of turning around such films forget it they could have taken their time like harry potter and done fine i dont even like harry potter but i dont see flaws i dont see repetition the acting is more impressive so why award them when they didnt even live up to their best potential i look forward to the fan boys saying my comments werent helpful thats why i gave it one star if fan boys are going to bully the vote to put these movies in the upper echelon of films which is ridiculous i reserve the right to under them to help future generations know that the fans are delusional and overzealousnegative,brando was about the only semi decent thing in this mainly because he was hardly in it and i like brando overlong poorly edited piece of garbage first things first the movie looks like crap gordon willis cinematograpthy is absolutely appalling the editing is just bizarre it looks like it was made by a film maker trying to simulate tension or sadness and tragedy but had no ideas how to use the tools an experienced director would have used the music made me want to smash my brains in and james caan as an italian american gangster was just ridiculous it would be like getting danny glover to play maculay culkins character in home alone but then again as someone who has seen a lot of the movies produced by coppola like peggy sue got married tucker the man and his dream the cotton club finnians rainbow the rainmaker and many more poorly filmed dated badly written pieces of forgettable rubbish i should have expected the godfather to be as appalling as i found it but as everyone who has ever seen the godfather who happens to be a film buff and not just a normal guy in the street who will watch the occasional movie they tend to drool over this muddy looking scrappy overlong bore fest all in all i would say this movie should probably be destroyed so morons cant talk about how it is the holy grail of all movies ever madenegative,i do not understand all the praise this movie gets i expected a masterpiece but i was let down by a weak story and mostly sub par acting i do not really feel it is a 1 star movie i would probably give it 4 or 5 stars if i was to be honest about it but i felt i needed to help drop its rating from the ridiculous 97 it currently has it started off strong and very emotionally as bonasera played magnificently and convincingly by salvatore corsitto told don corleone about the tragic and severe beating two boys gave his daughter when she refused to let them have their way with her begging corleone to deliver justice she was beaten so badly that her nose was crushed and her jaw was completely shattered i actually teared up a bit at this due to the amazing delivery he gave of his lines after that the movie just goes flat in my opinion no wonder coppola put that scene at the very beginning there is just nothing interesting about the storyline of this movie its a bunch of stuff about a bunch of italian mobsters from mob families do for 3 hours other than corsittos brief performance all other acting in this movie is cold and uninteresting there is almost no real character development especially with michael corleone al pacino and the woman he marries while hiding out for a year in italy it was just so out of place and random i just kind of scratched my head about that i didnt even remotely care that she died when somebody rigged their car with a bomb and blew it up honestly i was happy that she was out of the story if anything what little story there is anyway in the end while there were some promising things in the film it never really capitalized on them it just seemed like most of the film was a hodge podge of small unrelated shallow stories of which none were fully explored i just thought this film was frustratingly dull i did not give a damn about any character in the film they just seemed so distant with so very little development and actual substance because of this whenever any of them died i did not care much the movie takes itself far too seriously for its own quality it is self indulgent and bland the worst thing about the movie was al pacinos acting i never thought i would say that about al pacino as he has always been by far one of my favorite actors he is incredible in films like the devils advocate so much talent but it just didnt show in this movie maybe it was the scripts fault i dont understand how he so easily went from not wanting anything to do with the family business to having people killed left and right as the new don it just didnt make any sense to me i will say marlon brando played vito corleone well but even he at many times over acted in his role sometimes he just appeared so cheesy campy thats about all i really have to say about this movie not horrible but far from an all time great its okay there was a good 45 minutes of crap they could have cut to make it not be so needlessly drawn out the bottom line if youve never seen it it might worth a viewing to make up your own mind as apparently many folks feel the opposite of how i do about it just dont be surprised if you fall asleep at some point i recommend brewing up a pot of coffee before hand just in casenegative,it is very sad for me to see such an awful immoral movie on any top list much less number 19 this high rating shows how desensitized the world had made us that people would rave over a movie that shows a man raping another man that uses the f word 200 times in the first 10 minutes that shows what is supposedly pieces of a mans head splatter in a car and that shows people overdosing on drugs is very very disturbing disheartening and sickening there was no redeeming value to this movie it was awful and should not have been given a rating r or for that matter have ever even been released to view i guess if you are morbid and over 30 they should have rented it to you but no one under 30 and certainly no one under 21 should have been able to see this movie i was sixteen when i saw it and i was appalled i was not impressed by the colorful display of language drugs sexual immorality or violence in this movie they should have created a new rating for this movie no one with any type of morals should see this movie whatever letter that would be to see this movie and see the high rating shows me why there are so many murders every year and why there are school shootingsnegative, you people are so comic it makes me batty is it a good movieyes was it a brilliantly imagined and epic series of filmsyes was it one of the best 50 films of all timenot a chance in hell i dont care if you 15 year olds want to live in fantasy land the rest of your lives but spare us from this lotr are the best movies ever crap we dont need to hear it and it makes us laugh it was a great series to watch but when you come on here and disrespect the film greats of all time and have any of these lotr movies in the top 100 it disrespects the entire film industry if you want to play fantasy time then go on a disney board and post away but do us all a favor and leave the imdb for real movies negative,what is the pulp and what is the fiction of this film this film makes no sense at allthe sad thing is that it does not have any realitygodard has abandoned france and now lives in a tiny swiss town of rolle i can assure that even godard will say that this film has no beginningno middle and no end and that too in no particular senseas quentino tarantino has crooked teeth may be people like his films for that reasonall the actors of this film look confusedthe great actress from portugal maria de medeiros wasted her talent for a minor role which no one will ever bother to rememberalthough it was a comeback vehicle for john travoltahe has not acted wellsam jackson is confusedthe most confused of them all is christopher walkenlet the others make merry but quentin tarantino will bore people to death with silly films like kill billstay way from this film as it is a waste of moneynegative, i am a teenager and i never thought of finding the godfather so interesting it shows a vivid and perfect example of the words classic and timeless in a movie the godfather takes you to different heights with each scene directed of course by francis ford coppola marlon brando plays one of his funniest for me anyway and greatest role al pacino is another worth mentioning the acting and the presentation of both actors are some of the key success of the godfather having seen the movie makes me want to pick up the book if you need a break from all the recent typical movies then watch the godfather negative,i did not understand what quentin tarantino wanted to convey to the viewers with this film i dont really see what the hype is about when it comes to this movie lack of a solid story and bond between events and choppy weird offensive violent and even sodomy rape there are ample of examples of bad photography throughout the movie i am 49 and for me its a complete waste of my time uma thurman john travolta and bruce willis were brilliant thoughthere is nothing in this movie that will leave a mark in your mind or soul its a style over substance i will not recommend this movie i think this film is the most overrated movie in historynegative,man fellowship was much better than this piece of junk a lot of the shots were horrible the cgi except for gollum sucked the dialogue was beyond cheesy the battles were anti climatic the way the war ended w the dead people was dumb the ending dragged on and on and on i checked my watch at least 15 times during this movie the battle scenes blah and if the fate of the world is in your hands and your supposedly out numbered why freakin joke while your fighting and putting notches on your belt thats just so freakin lame the attempts at comedy in this movie were laughable if you want to watch a movie w real battle scenes do yourself a favor and go see last samurai ive seen that movie 2 times and im going to have to see it again to get the bad taste out of my mouth that is rotknegative,when i searched amongst the endless lists of reviews given about this movie i had not found one that gave it less than 7 stars in order to truly see a movie for what it is one must look past all that makes it great into its minor flaws and weaknesses if you the reader were drawn to this review because of the low rating well i am sorry but i have mislead you however i have also led you to something greater and different from the rest of the reviews for this film to get to the point shawshank redemption is magnificently made and deserves incredible amounts of praise for its entertainment value and perspective on life in prison however the themes of the film are rather shallow the entire theme can be summarized in a short sentence friendship and hope can get you through almost anything although it is a great message it is simply a nugget of what could have been much greater now i know that i have only given the film 1 star here but that was only to draw attention so that you may finally see that this film although superb is not perfect by any means as is suggested by the vast quantity of perfect reviews in all honesty i would give it nine stars out of ten and would encourage everybody to see it great not perfect but after all where can true perfection honestly be foundnegative,to contradict my summary line this film is actually one of the least appealing films i have ever seen its violent disgusting and crude and none of these are particularly bad traits its just that it offers me nothing and leaves me with an emptiness the fact that i have wasted 2 1 2 hrs watching this then not to be compensated this is entirely my opinion and clearly mine alone nearly everyone loves this film and they are honest enough to clarify it but if my review is completely the opposite i still feel compelled to write im sorry but 9th on the list of the top 250 films seems grossly inappropriatenegative,this movie is overrated plain and simple i watched this piece of garbage and i can only wonder why so many people feel it necessary to jump on the im cool bandwagon two or three decent scenes does not make a movie great face reality this movie stinksnegative,im sorry but this is crap this movies contains too much violence for nothing the use of violence in movies is understandable but im not fond of this overdose i do not appreciate it a all of course this is a huge problem with movies especially with the hollywood movies violence in films effects society as not all people can draw the line tarantino do not spare extra crime in his movies and pulp fiction is not an exception the most ridiculous thing is that in a way the violent characters looks cool and fun some of them get away with murder as if its a part of a romantic sweet meaningful episode in their cool lives as in bruce willis character its a shame this movie is on top of the pack with its  here wish u peace & love everyonenegative, i dont know what everyone is talking about but watching the back of my hand for two hours while a small cat constantly bit me was way more entertaining than watching this movie id put off seeing this movie for years for fear of being bored unfortunately when it was forced in at a party i couldnt escape i sat there like a normal person awaiting a plot and something entertaining however the words i dont get it and god please make this end were constantly repeated in my head over and over again i think tarintino is one of a kind and in a good way i just dont get whats so great about this movie bottom line i still believe that when too many stars enter a film it will suck maybe one day ill be proven wrong negative, the director was pretty jealous of the fact that a movie has to end otherwise this movie would never have had an end an interesting start the first movie of the trilogy fellowship of the ring but absolutely boring on the road to the end of it im disappointed with this movie as ive expected more of it the characters seemed wonderful at the beginning but the director made the worst of them shameful more shameful as this is the movie that won the oscar i cannot think of the motives the academy awarded the prize to this movie but the money that went into it its the second time in the history that i know of that the academy appreciates more the cost of a movie than the quality of it and of the actors play its interesting in this approach that no actor in this movie won the oscar why is that negative, im glad there are a few voices of dissent within all of the gushing hype listed here do the fans of this movie rate citizen kane as the 2nd best film of all time then maybe listen to the beatles and elvis presley as the greatest music of all time is america under some kind of cultural mass hypnosis grossly overrated on all counts negative,am i seemingly in a very small minority that find gangster films so soo sooo very dull i concede that the godfather is the most famous of this genre but as for it forever topping film polls im not so sure and when i say not sure i mean definitely not i also admit that im not a brando fan but if this film is meant to be the best of the best it shouldnt matter if i like brando or not i should still like the film right and i just dont my dad is the biggest brando fan and even he doesnt reach for this film when he fancies a bit of marlon in my opinion carlitos way or the untouchables are far superior filmsof the genre i think the main problem i have with the godfather other then the never ending dullness of it is that it always seems to be saying oh look isnt cool to be in the mob we should all do it of course it all goes belly up the the boys in the end but thats just a convention of the genre that has to be met rather then being the message of the film not my cup of tea at all im afraidnegative,i dont know if you have seen the same movie ive seen but this movie was awful i really really liked the first movie an obvious 10 the second was a little bit worse yet still a 7 but this one was really bad i mean what is the reason for a happy happy happy happy end which is 30 minutes too long the characters are flat and no one cares if anyone of the main characters dies or notlike the king because you cant feel connected to them gollum should be dead two times before he is falling into the fire it is just boring after the second part if hords of orks are fighting against man and the worst thing was legolas after sliding down this elephant like animal and posing so bad animated and so silly unfortunately this movie was so disappointing like matrix 3negative,i know this is pointless since it will be in 3000 other reviews and no one will ever read it but whatever anyways on with the review ok ill admit it when i went and first saw this movie in the theatre i thought it was amazing i even did what other people did and started quoting the joker all the time and good lord did that get burnt out real fast but then i bought the movie and kind of thought to myself you know what i should actually try to analyze this movie as a whole and not just pay attention to one persons performanceaka heath ledger so i sat down and watched it and i realized holy crap this movie is bad really bad i did not realize how many plot holes this dang thing had and the fact that it is in imdbs top 10 best movies of all time is just insane look im sorry christopher nolan fans but i have to give you the gods honest truth this movie is not top 10 worthy i think the only reason why this movie has such a high rating is because of obsessive heath ledger fans and the christopher nolan fans who cant stop sucking on his tit they think he can do no wrong well thats what this movie is wrong i mean cmon you christopher nolan fans are telling me that you can honestly sit there and tell me this movie is better than these and yes dark knight is currently ranked higher than all these movies i listed schindlers list saving private ryan terminator 2 the original star wars american history x the lord of the rings fight club forrest gump the matrix the silence of the lambs citizen kane and full metal jacket no no no no no no absolutely not im sorry mister nolan but youre obviously really good at brainwashing your fan base thats the only explanation ive got is that christopher has discovered how to hypnotize people and he can do it very well its ratings on movies like this that really make me think about how stupid society is nowadays im sorry if i sound a little aggressive in this review but i honestly feel this movie does not deserve the huge spotlight that everyone gave itnegative, two viewings first viewing reaction possibly the worst film ever made brilliant subtle joker performance weighed down by an overly pretentious film why is batman even in the film confusing chase scenes confusing to the point of boredom ridiculous james bond episode in hong kong at what point between the previous batman film and this one did gotham city miraculously turn into chicago stupid cell phone ploy fell asleep halfway through woke up in the middle of a morgan freeman plea for individual freedom or something like that im bored maybe i missed something second viewing reaction the worst film ever made brilliant subtle joker performance weighed down by an overly pretentious film why is batman even in the film confusing chase scenes confusing to the point of boredom ridiculous james bond episode in hong kong at what point between the previous batman film and this one did gotham city miraculously turn into chicago stupid ridiculous cell phone ploy fell asleep halfway through woke up in the middle of a morgan freeman plea for individual freedom or something like that why am i here negative,one of the worst films ive forced myself to sit through nothing happens except explosions and violence skip it and heath ledgers oscar win was solely for the fact he had died basically i think america had become the only country in the world where a movie like this could be popular a movie about a superhero who wants to clean a fictional metro city up morgan freeman micheal caine anymore oscar winners looking for money and the screen time of this was atrocious i seriously thought the movie was never going to endnegative,this is good example of how to not to make a movie it begins quite dry the main character doesnt seem like he quite knows how to act as he is thrown into a poorly lit scene in what seems to be the directors garage revamped he then goes to prison no sense whatsoever obviously there is a huge paradigm between what the director though the film to be and the original writers we then see all of what we normally find in prison with a very fatal exception no mining i am a personal favorite of mining in prison i love to see people smash rocks and burn coal for fire we mainly find dry dialog from what appears to be actors who have never left their parents basement no wonder the director still films at his home i had to leave the room a few times so that i could get some fresh air while the movie attempted be filmed my advice is to buy this film only if you need a dvd or vhs tape for a scrap booking project the reflective qualities are very nice and the packaging insert can also be used to store a home video be sure not to allow the label to be visible as that may cause your friends to disown you forevernegative,im sorry i dont mean to offend people who like this film but what on earth is all the fuss about over this film it is nothing compared to the godfather and yet people vote it as second to the number 1 the shawshank redemption has a relatively simple plot dull camera work the script is full of soppy language thanks to the overrated steven kingthat just isnt particularly clever in any waythe atmosphere of prison is totally unrealistic all the characters are wimpsthe only good element is morgan freeman because hes a good actorthere arent any clever twists for instance the mystery of what is in the box at the end of the film is really unoriginal please feel free to argue with me over this but come on people step back and look at the film what is it made up of then look at the godfather look at what that is made up of brill cast excellent plot damn good script good directing and camera work everything is perfect then look back at the shawshank redemption its just at a completely different level its quite ridiculous reallynegative, well made prison buddy drama has no rough edges its so clean cut and conventional its not funny literally its involving you care for the characters and are interested in what happens to them but quite frankly it feels so literary morgan freemans voiceover sounding exactly like a stephen king narration which it is by the way the way red morgan freeman tells the story of mystery man andy dufresnetim robbins is as old as watson telling of mystery man sherlock holmes this formula was invented by arthur conan doyle stephen king has a way of writing that always feels like hes appealing to the masses always trying to sound nostalgic and profound instead of just telling a story thats honest you feel theres this constant need to say something about life the universe and everything countless instances of pretensious philosophising abound in this which sound about as profound as sayings your grandfather tells you some birds are not meant to be caged their feathers are too bright or get busy living or get busy dying or terrible thing to live in fear or it was like some beautiful bird flapped into our drab little cage and made those walls dissolve away or need it so you dont forget forget that there are places in the world that arent made out of stone or hope is a good thing and good things can never die  if you say so sensei also kings stories always feel like someone has sat there trying to think of a good story instead of feeling natural so the reason most things happen in this movie all the little episodes are not because it necessarily fits the character but because it would make a good story for it to happen that way and after a while this gets tiring i just cant take it seriously morgan freeman sounds like grandfather telling a story which can sometimes feel patronising but i suppose to does work well with the period feel of this picture which by definition tries to connect with the past problem is stephen king never leaves anything to the imagination he tells us everything if tim robbins organises some special event for the inmates like playing music over the loudspeaker morgan freemans voice will come right out and suggest a few reasons why this episode is so wonderful significant the nature of which are very similar through each episode of the movie and darabont obviously likes the idea of assuming the audience are very thick and will not see or experience anything unless you dictate to them what to experience and has made his movie by it also im starting to be wary of thomas newman as a composer doing exactly what darabont has done as a director employ a formula that has worked in the past his  for shawshank is calculated on the same formula of highs lows and general atmosphere as in his  for road to perdition american beauty meet joe black horse whisperer scent of a woman and the green mile not surprisingly if you think about all these movies they all have a similar feel they all go for a similar nostalgia haunting sadness which admittedly i find very appealing but im starting to worry at how similar they all are i think encouraging this movie too much is like rewarding someone for employing a formula very successfully instead of taking risks and doing something edgy that still turns out to be enjoyable and brilliant most people do not evaluate movies based on their imdb ranking but i certainly would be surprised if any major lists ranked this in their top ten that said this is still a very good movie with good performances a good unity despite its necessarily episodic nature and it looks great its only for movies people insist on putting on best ever lists that i require a certain originality the feeling that what this movie gives you you could not get anywhere else i believe this is why movies like citizen kane vertigo 2001 raging bull third man grand illusion persona and for me exterminating angel are constantly mentioned on such lists and deservedly what this movie gave me i could get from reading any other stephen king story or seeing any other movie adaptation of a king story so my review is mainly in backlash against this movies being regarded so highly but when it comes down to it as i said i enjoyed it and thought it was a five star movie negative, the notion that this movie belongs in the top 100 of anybodys list is simply retarded this b movie with an a movie list is standard run of the mill tv movie of the week fare how did it get this high whats wrong with the vast number of imdb users that they would vote so highly in favor of such a piece of trite my theory tim robbins is sending each of you a check thats the only explanation this movie offers nothing special nothing different nothing unique no great performances a phoned in morgan freeman performance akin to his deep impact presidential performance no graphic portrayals or stark realism of life behind bars nothing this movie achieves what few in history have done it both sucks and blows negative,this is not a batman movie it is just wrong again with the realism batman isnt supposed to be realistic and when you make batman realistic it doesnt feel like batman anymore this movie is full of speeches all the joker does is vomit up dialogue he also doesnt even look like the joker the joker is supposed to use toy like gadgets and weapons not all real weapons now onto batman christian bale is once again terrible and is not fitting in the role his voice is the worst voice ever this also has to be the most overrated film of all time people rave that this is the best batman movie ever no it isnt this doesnt even feel or look like a batman movie this is even less creative than batman begins it is also even more boring i am so sad to see my favorite superhero be reduced to a growling dancing and uninteresting character nolan is to into making his batman films realistic that he forgets one of the most important that make a batman movie and that is creativity you have to be creative when making a film on any superhero especially batman it is just something that lacks in his batman films this is such a bad movienegative,loved batman begins then it seems like christopher nolan lost his love if he ever had it for the source material i am a huge batman fan and will give any adaptation my full support i can usually get something out of it the more i watch the 2 dark knight movies the more i hate them and the more i think that nolan was never a batman fan the stories are poorly thought out but thats not exactly nolans fault its how he introduces our heroes and villains that make me question his passion for the projects in a scene that looks like it was shot by my older brother and his friends with a $40 video camera batman is introduced only after seeing a few pathetic batman copycats then we see him running through a parkade after a car he is indistinguishable at this point from the copycats not how i wanna be reintroduced to my favorite comic book character in a fluorescent lit parkade uncertain if its even him wheres the mystique wheres the darkness the mythos wheres the fear hes supposed to bring with him its all washed out the second bad entrance was with the most significant villain in comic book lore the joker i know everybody loves heath rip but i cannot approve of his portrayal firstly the joker the joker is introduced when he casually walks into a scene reminiscent of a scene out of dick tracy where a bunch of corny campy bad guys exchange dialogue in what is supposed to be a meeting of gothams underworld kings then some nobody strolls into this basement with his henchmen like a background character might does some tongue acting then puts the screws to the crime bosses with no opposition how did the joker even find out about this meeting and how was he allowed to waltz in with no charisma might i say wheres the evil wheres the man behind the face paint wheres the unbridled lunacy the key to a good villain is that you want to hate him but you cant help but love him i couldnt find the joker a joker any joker in any minute of ledgers performance his characters ability to predict the multitude of variables that had to occur for his plan to go off is unbelievable even for the truest of believers agent of chaos or not i need my joker to be somewhat grounded connected to something to have some motivation some cause for his direction ive already been lambasted by the people around me so i understand if this review will upset people im happy there are so many die hard passionate dark knight fans but i have to state what is so obvious to me shot for shot this is a train wreck oldmans comatose performance as gordon the purposeless tacked on fight scene near the end of the movie all of it just cant do it its plot is challenging in many ways absolutely stupid in most others no rendition will ever ruin batman for me but the follow up dark knight rises which i also hated cemented to me the lack of love on nolans partnegative,its an okay film epic and all of course the fact that its an epic like gladiator or troy doesnt mean its good troy proved that fact and alexander continued to prove it with one star antics to be quite frank peter jackson is an overrated director much like the lord of the rings movies are overrated movies if you notice all three are located in the top fifteen films this one happens to be ranked higher than greatly superiour films such as seven samurai schindlers list and even casablanca this is not the case with camera angles that make you sick utilising the admittedly beautiful landscape of new zealand to help push across into our heads the true epic feeling of middle earth but wait where are the interesting characters every one of them you feel so bored with by the time the first film is up you seem to hope that theyd be dead by the second one but no they come along to the third one to kick some sauron ass heres my view of lord of the rings a whole load of walking lord of the rings fellowship of the ring points there walks lord of the rings the two towers points there walks trips up walks on lord of the rings return of the king points there walks throws ring into mountain walks away take those completely identical scenarios and pile them up with useless plot for three to four hours per movie depending on which one you watch and i myself wouldnt touch the extended versions you really get the idea that the academy awards truly are flawed why look forrest gump won best film of 1994 instead of the shawshank redemption or pulp fiction titanic won best film of 1997 instead of la confidential and why lookey here lotr rotk won best ing film of 2003 instead of mystic river perhaps next year well have the constant gardener as the best film of 2005 that may actually redeem the oscars failing reputation a reputation that had truly fallen when they took this half arsed effort of a movie and worshipped it as best film negative, i loved batman begins it advanced from burtons shallow fun and brought him reality naturally i expected yet more from goyer and nolan boy was i wrong this movie is a nerdy fanboy jerk fest the hype it has received is so unjustifiable that it can only be the product of warner marketing and fanboy internet manipulation no film can go to #1 on imdb in 48 hours without prior orchestration while a final reckoning between batman and gothams lowest is inspired the story becomes a mess of plot lunacy the jokers great but i was dumbstruck to watch the camera suck off ledgers performance to wallpaper over plot chasms generally shallow characters and a complete lack of the dark knight himself where is batman in this movie he is nothing a playboy billionaire on a yacht who wrecks lamborghinis in a vain attempt to prove hes a hero he didnt prove it to me one shred batman begins reveals wayne as a tortured soul making the world a better place for the memory of his mother and father his moral code here was impossible to track he mocks other vigilantes with high school quips about hockey while they get murdered along with many for what they believe isnt what they believe what he believes claims he mustnt kill comic lore as its immoral but happily jams shut a police interrogation door so he can beat six bells out of the joker it seemed to me that gordon and dent with the placid ms dawes were in the moral front line while batman lurks in shadows all mr wayne contributes are ridiculous gizmos for epileptic action scenes batbikes tripping trucks like skywalker tripping an atat cell phones become security cameras gatling guns that rebuild bullets so we can scrutinise fingerprints for no good reason another bat suit lamborghinis & yacht lounging need i go on the worse effect of this is do you even need batman consider a film with gordon and dent fighting alone against the jokers criminal nihilism they battle and win only for dent to be consumed by his war against evil sounds good i was watching that fine movie until they wrote batman into it and when the batman spoke at all it was digitised alligator gruff tone that made me laugh the story ricochets everywhere hong kong a gotham come miami and through multiple plots until youre just enjoying the cinematography during another action yawn after two hours i could not care who did what or why least of all batman this film resembled an over hyped episode of 24 complete with real time waronterror inspirations to such a degree i wondered if jack bauer would make a better batman at least he would have been at the forefront of events a little more for a superhero the dark knight was an amoral superflop the culmination of this movies propensity for absurdity it the arrival of two face his injury from some of the jokers mountain of bombs is ridiculous no human being could come close to surviving this let alone check out of a hospital to roam the streets for revenge but it was done for the comic owners need to make the silly real for fans and ultimately thats what this film is about dark knights biggest error is its script editing it seems most of the writing is done by the nolan brothers with just minor input from goyer has the studio let the nolan boys run amuck every idea they have come up with or stole from 24 is crammed into this film until it explodes some dont rate goyer but he has more experience writing and may have controlled a few must be his the absurd elements and kept pacing sensible this film is also far detached from nolans previous work prestige momento and is either a poorly conceived sortie into action adventure on his part or the studios yanked the rug from under him it does appear warners sponging off ledgers unfortunate demise with him receiving triple screen time from batman bale also seems bored when he performs he has always liked deep complex characters to play so i suspect he was also unimpressed with the script batman begins was outstanding but imho the dark knight lets its predecessor down in spectacular fashion i wont say dont see it do and make up your own mind if you are one of the happy brain washed masses that love the dark knight because warner dc says you should then enjoy however i am not one of them sorry bat fans negative, in reality i give this film a  of 4 out of 10 but the one star rating you see above is intended to balance out the obvious shill vote marketing hype astroturf 10 10 votes and comments by paid for marketing weenies posing as real unbiased people at the time of this writing the film has a 97 out of 10 rating which it clearly does not in any sense deserve it merits half that rating i saw batman last night 25 hours meant that one gets ones moneys worth but heck its not half as good as advertisers and imdbcom would have us believe the plot line drags the characters are shallow the morality is deeply confused and wildly warped the dark knight is more like a dim bulb its hard to believe in heath ledger as the joker hes just too broad in the face one dimensional in this role and weighed down by poor writing his makeup was supposed to be degrading throughout the film but there were obvious touch ups and clean ups that reminded the audience this is make believe his garb was supposed to be purple on green but was so dark as to look like a black suit his actions were so reckless that we as an audience were constantly reminded that this aint even close to reality even a toddler wouldnt believe that this scheme would leave the joker alive and thriving worse were given zero back story to help us believe that the jokers feelings and craziness are based on something in fact the film goes far out of its way to emphasize that the joker has no past no legitimate reason for his hatred and aggression and is simply not understandable to that i say go back to scriptwriting school and take a few psychology classes while youre there a character isnt menacing or intriguing unless we see the mechanism driving the emotions worse christian bale as batman christian bale though good at dieting and working out has all the humanity and emotiveness of rotting firewood without a sound track sure hed do well as a male model as a actor though hes just taking up space on the screen worse his lisping with obvious sound effects to lower and strengthen his voice make him unbelievable as batman and as perfectionist billionaire commissioner gordon gary oldman gave an unemotive performance worse he seemed to be struggling with his accent so much that he had no time for other aspects of acting this is not the caliber of performance that he delivered for leon  the professional and bram stokers dracula this was an obvious potboiler walk on and take the money performance likewise for all the other performers except hyperactive heath ledger and a small one dimensional part played by the wife of one character i felt no emotion from any of the other actors and actresses despite the big ups and downs in the plot line dammit if your daddy dies or you quit your lifelong job youghta look a little broken up with two exceptions the special effects did nothing for me 1 i felt a bit of adrenalin when batman was standing on a ledge atop a skyscraper while the camera looked over his shoulder into the street 2 harvey two faces mask was well done that gets a thumbs up though i wouldnt want kids seeing it or theyll have nightmares a few scenes just left me scratching my head saying that would never happen thats beyond stupid even for a cartoon movie when batman glides down from one building on his wings darn it the wings should look full of air like a parachute not luffing like a sail pointed in the wrong direction even the love interest was a bit bland they found a frumpy not too pretty woman to play batmans love of his life and apparently asked her to play her role as though nothing romance impending death and explosions matters ive seen people react more strongly when they get the wrong kind of coffee from a starbucks > o the morality is twisted from a comic book one should expect flat one dimensional thinking from frank miller the talented artist but stupid ayn rand follower who wrote the comic book on which this film is based one should expect wildly offensive morality that would make even an idiot say wtf man rethink this the plot and characters will inevitably be compared to americas mccarthyist style war on terrorism and that just sickens me because i see the film try to justify a patronizing lying violent attitude from government and a billionaire everywhere in the film actors are saying this is wrong headed illegal untruthful patronizing to the citizenry and an abuse of power but were in a dark scary time so its ok for now art imitates life eh i felt deeply ill so far this summer hancock is the only superhero movie id endorse and that would only get a weak thumbs up its at least funny and does not try to paint a comic book morality as heroic so what should you see as an action popcorn movie this summer im wondering if the voyage to the center of the earth film or the new mummy film both starring brendan frasier will be a bit better or at least have a few funny lines the trailers though hint that theyll be campy and unbelievable negative, i have never understood why people love this movie so much it isnt a bad movie but it simply is not great yes i understand the plot no i dont like stupid romantic comedies or anything like like i am a big scorsese and oliver stone fan this movie is not terribly smart not violent in any way we havent seen before what this movie did is dress it up in hip clothes so high school kids and young adults would identify with it if you want gritty and smart watch a scorsese picture if you want over the top violence watch natural born killers if you want trendy and cool watch pulp fiction negative,so i will keep this particular comment very brief yuck the worst movie ive ever seen not even excepting plan 9 from outer space which is at least so bad that its uproariously funny i so wanted to find anything in this movie that i could say something positive about racking my brain all i can come up with is this its been years since ive seen it and thinking about it even now kinda makes me want to puke my apologies to tarantino fansnegative,i have now put myself through the sometimes enjoyable but mostly painful experience of watching these three movies i have to say i do think the 3rd one was the best but lets be honest it didnt have much competition one thing is for sure this film and the trilogy as a whole is easily the most overrated event in history many films should be above this effort in the top250 the problems the plot for starters not only did it not make any sense it was basically after 9 hours about destroying a ring and fighting a couple of battles all the meaningless subplots and political gesturing really didnt add to the film the characters werent fleshed out at all even after 9 hours could you really mention much about any of the many characters as a result most of the time i couldnt care less about who was doing what and why for a film to be a classic surely it must have some surprises or must be original in some way and perhaps more importantly stir the juices of our soul all we had were some very good special fx and some nice new zealand scenery the filming was very much join the dots stuff nothing novel or clever it the way it was shown to the viewer do we really need to here the word `precious again and again do we really need to see yet another slow motion close up of frodos face all of this made the film and films over long and lacking in any substancenegative,this is the worst movie ever it is so over rated one of the worst movies ever made 3 oscars are you kidding me more like 0 oscars why do people like this movie so much i guess all critics and 91 percent of people are dumb oh well as i was saying avoid this film at all costs al pacino and robert duvall are the worst actors ever and its so boring i fell asleep half way through it then i woke up it was still going i fell asleep again i woke up again and it was still going i know i already said this bt the godfather is the worst movie ever it was so bad that im just kidding its a classic its still over rated but thats not saying much 10 10negative,i will never understand why pulp fiction is hailed by so many as one of the greatest films ever made quentin tarintinos first film reservoir dogs was amazing it had excellent performances some good action scenes an impressive structure and fantastic sound track when pulp fiction came out in my country in october 1994 i could not wait to see it empire magazine gave it 5 stars i remember when i went up to glasgow to see it with an anticipation i had not felt since i had went to see some thing like star wars or indiana jones oh boy twenty minutes in and i was already sick to death of samuel jacksons character he just talked and talked and talked andtalked john travoltas vince vega was a guy i wanted to decimate oh travolta you looked ridiculous with those hair extensions and then you talked and talked and talked with uma thurman in a silly black wig there was so much talking in this film that it made me want to walk out i have only ever done this once in my life and it was with that utter garbage jack nicholson flick wolf tosh so i kept hoping that something good would happenchristopher walken as an army bloke talking and talking about a gold watch up his assnot gooda male rape scene with talknot goodquentin tarintino turning up in a cameo that should have got him shot in real life talk talk about disposing of bodiesoh this film was the pits i must have been the only one in the audience that hated this film because everyone was whooping and hollering like they were watching a naked gun comedy oh yes they loved it quiet frankly my admiration of tarintino was gone forever he got his head together with the brilliant jackie brown then lost the plot again with the silly kill bill volumes pulp fiction is one of the worst movies ive ever had to endure its a long boring ride to a sore headnegative, compared to the original movie 1 no batman movie can beat the original batman 1989 2 theres not even a batwing and batmobile 3 heath ledger did a very good dark version of the joker but unfortunately there is no better joker than jack nicholson 4 danny elfman could not do a better job making the soundtrack 5 the 1989 batman main theme has an unforgettable recognizable classic 6 christian bales voice as batman is always grumbling which just sounds horrible every time he speaks 7 christian bales head wearing the batman mask does not even fit him looking ridiculous which he fails in the role of batman 8 original batmobile is a classic car vehicles used in the dark knight enormous large sized wheels under an ugly armored piece of steel 9 no batcave 10 christopher nolan youre out of order with these modern batman film series 1 out of 10 for the dark knight 2008 negative,a ponderously slow moving script interspersed with vulgar blood and guts scenes after about 20 minutes of this tripe i wanted to drop a bomb in the middle and wipe out the whole lot of them for the good of humanity with few exceptions pacino the acting was also of low caliber all the money spent on the sets costumes and backdrops could not make up for the lack of any direction or purpose to the main storylinenegative,as a 19 yr old watching this film recently for my first time i simply cant see this film continuing to be considered the best film of all time yes the acting is good and the script is very smooth but there are large chunks of this film that can only be described as horribly boring nearly everyone i know in my generation agrees this is highly overrated so i think its only a matter of time before another film lifts it off top spot hopefully shawshank redemption although return of the king is more likely 4 10negative, the godfather is a terrible film its the worst movie ive seen in a decade the acting in this film is excruciatingly painful the whole family are watered down sopranos who show some phenomenally strong lack of chemistry the boring weeding scene is the highlight michael is a wet fish and his relationship with kay is very dumb and also stupid and weird the godfather scenes make me sick and woozy i havent seen such dramatized try to be cool dialogue since any given sunday pacino was less wooden in gigli that other film he also carried both puzo and brest were largely let down thanks to this tony montana the characters of sonny and fredo were so unrealistic i thought they were comic book i must also highly criticize the music in this film as being childish and sometimes often out of place now on to some other failings of this pathetic movie the dialogue was silly if it was supposed to be nail biting well it failed the manner in which the actors delivered their lines was uninspiring brando in particular sucked what about the long and tired sicily scenes reference to four hours of lawrence of arabia i dont know the car exploding was so unoriginal and clich‹©d and the take over cross baptism montage come on do some cgi instead bah armatures how this is ranked above that masterpiece muriels wedding stumps me if they had replaced the old and tired francis ford with the more youthful nicolas they might have hit pay dirt negative,okey i went to the cinema for this movie with the idea it was higher rated then the godfather and pulp fiction well i just registered to imdb to say i was very disappointed about this movie just because the flaws in the movie some here are some really stupid things in the movie 1 batman can bend a gun barrel whit his bare hands 2 dogs can chew true batman armour but bullets cant 3 the joker can do everything 31 he drives a school bus into a bank and drive away without being noticed by anyone and the bus had no scratch on it 32 he can get into everything even on a parade with 100 of cops and the cops just ignore him there not even thinking about where there colleges are but cops dont think in this movie they just panic when 1 guy takes a shot at the mayor 33 the hospital that is guarded by lot of cops joker just walked in the explosives are just there and he just walked out and blows the whole place up he gets on a school bus and vanished into fin air 34 he has tons of explosives on ferries that are heavily overcrowded 35 they lock him up with a personal guard but they also lock him up in a general jail did he wanted room service on his jail or was the personal guard to prevent him from getting bored but again cops are stupid in this movie i had a lot of moment in the movie with just shoot the joker gotham was not gotham but some city in the usa batcave was some to big ugly place under the ground with to many lights third degree burn wounds just put a blanked on it wait some days and its all good but ugly and god he was in pain i really noticed that balistic testing with some big ass gun why do you need a machine gun to fire 1 shot at a time for testing this movie is just bad but there some good things one is the joker was good he missed some good joker jokes but at least is was evil and really that the best thing i have to say about the movie i give it a 1 against all those who gave it a 10 normally i would give it a 6 10negative, this movie is overlong by at least a half hour i am so tired of films that have about six or seven endings its become a bit of a clich‹© just when you thought it was safe to get up from your seat and start filing out of the theater another epilogue begins and youre forced to sit through at least another ten minutes of ridiculous overblown pretentious blather thats been well covered in the previous four or five epilogues some writer directors just dont know when to say when and thats usually a sign that they dont have confidence in their material nor their approach to it this movie is a prime example of that kind of narrative drawback but thats just the beginning of my complaints about the dark knight loud obnoxious puerile without one whit of wit this movie also represents the extreme destructiveness of a relentless hype machine thats intent on whittling down our collective sense and sensibilities the acting which ranges from wooden to hyperbolic seems as if its being carried out by inter planetary aliens who have no idea what its like to be human the script sounds as if it was written by someone who barely made it out of bone head freshman composition ive never heard or seen so many clich‹©s strung together in a misguided attempt at profundity and universality as each new clich‹© ridden set piece followed another i began to feel beaten down as if my defenses against such obvious manipulation were being fed upon by my own desire to enjoy what everyone else seemed to be accepting so readily fortunately my will to survive such cultural mediocrity is strong and i was able to withstand this latest onslaught with my dignity intact please understand i enjoyed batman begins a story that was told in a simple straightforward manner with some minor attempts at profundity that were in line with the childish comic book subject matter to try and make something so de profundis about a superhero running around in a bat costume chasing down some uber villain in grease paint and fright wig is truly akin to putting lipstick on a pig after its done you cant help but wonder are they really expecting people to take this crapola so seriously id rather see adam west and cesar romero go at it then have to sit through this load of pretentious horse manure at least i was able to get a laugh out of the original tv series which was undeniably a camp classic in its original incarnation negative, granted im not a huge splosion fan but walking out of the theater after just seeing this film i am appalled i feel like a roman who has just witnessed a tiger maul a man why wasnt this rated r why do we as a society think movies like this are amazing let alone acceptable i am an english teacher the symbolism and social commentary were not lost on me but at what point are dramatically violent scenes in a movie ultimately contributing to more violence in our communities what price do we pay as a society to entertain our growing need to witness this level of destruction using school buses to rob banks and murder blowing up hospitals pointing guns to childrens heads this has gone past harmless entertainment particularly when its witnessed by younger children there were a number of 6 9 year old boys in my showing that ended at midnight needless to say i will not be seeing a third installment of the franchise and will be encouraging people at least the last five on the planet who havent seen it to avoid this filmnegative,this is one of the worst movies ever made if you think that it will be as good a the original i urge you to never watch this heaths over the top ridiculous performance as the joker was not oscar worthy but they gave it to him because he died and robbed him in brokeback mountain the use of the harvey character was pathetic and christian bale is one of the wost actors to ever play batman his bruce wayne is the only redeeming quality of the movie other than gary oldman as commissioner gordan the whole movie is trying to be more epic than it is and this leads to a terrible storyline and pathetic use of special effects i would recommend watching the original batman with michael keaton any day dont waste your time with this crap written by nolan he is a hack unless you like batman sounding like he is satan dont watch this filmnegative,i dont want to waste more time on writing the review for this stupid movie as i have already wasted my precious time watching it this movies is over hyped con imdb gives it 92 i mean are you serious lolreally this is the biggest joke ever that an awful movie like this gets 92 direction is mediocre the hissing voice of batman is annoying it was supposed to sound intimidating and macho but it sounds as if he is having laryngitis instead joker was he really the joker who never laughs a joker is a character who is supposed to be full of surprises and tricks and most important the one who laughs in paradoxical situations unfortunately this joker was not even close to the actual joker character it seems as if joker controls the whole city but how and when god knows i cant go without mentioning that hyper sonar machine that can see every single person in the city this time the director really jumped out of his briefs you evacuate all the hospitals in the city except for the person for whom you are doing the evacuation lolwho was the writer i guess he didnt reach school higher than 2nd grade i have so much to say about this stupid movie but again as i have already promised that even reviewing this stupid movie is wastage of time so in the end this is the worst movie i have ever seen which paradoxically gets the best ratingnegative,ive never seen batman beginsbut my friends told me id get the dark knight anywaythey were way wrong this movie has either no plot at all or a plot so complex that the average person wont get it at all whats up with the mob thing it was never explained it any way shape or form and the movie was thrown into chaos so quickly that i sat through the whole 2 and a half hours of it trying to figure out what the heck was going on my friends told me that the first one was so much better but i dont know if i even want to see it after this pathetic attempt at a movie if your looking for something to see skip the dark knightand see mamma mia now thats a movie everyone would absolutely lovenegative,the dark knight is a good action movie that features tightly crafted action sequences and it boasts a decent story to tie it all together sadly though the story is still drawn out like all comic book movies the acting also is very bland with only heath ledger morgan freeman and michael caine performing well the direction is solid and nolan has learned from his mistakes in batman begins to say the least though the film needed a better editor as the film kind of drags on past its expiry date for a movie this long it needed a really good story but it lacked it and the ending is terrible overall though its a good film just not one of the best of 2008 itll be a fun movie to see for a night but the dark knight wont have you looking back on it as a classicnegative,if i could give this movie less than a 1 i would certainly do that i had read and heard so much about it that i was sure this would be a defining work of numbing minds to make a bad story look good with cheap tricks i was game and we thought it cant be as bad as the critics said you know critics sure enough give me a break with the awful acting ok excluding heath horrible camera work poor use of the budget that has been mentioned over and over again ive seen better on films with smaller budgets that are 100 times better its the director and the producer that makes films work they choose the teams thats it if they dont put it together and make it workit simply wont so they didnt and it doesnt worst part is that i know this group can do good work i just had to take the time to write this reviewthough im sure the film crew and the half crazed fans doesnt appreciate this review i hope im doing you all a favor with my wish for you to do well good luck final word the polar opposite of batman begins awesomenessnegative, indulge me for a second here imagine that youre a studio executive and someone is pitching the movie to you and heres what he says all right my movies based on old comic books and is set in a fictional city in it theres going to be a rich guy who goes around fighting crime while dressed like a bat because his parents died and then theres going to be this other guy who for no given reason dresses up like a clown acts creepy and goes around killing people the bat dressing person is going to go around trying to defeat him by beating people up with his bare hands meanwhile theres this other guy whos a perfectly nice lawyer but then his face gets burned so he decides to kill people based on this random coin that he has it sounds kind of funny and interesting to you but just as youre accepting it the person suddenly coughs under his breath oh yeah and im going to take it seriously like it was shakespeare and make it so depressing that it actively hurts the audience im not sure if thats exactly how the meeting proposing this movie went but it seems to be a reasonable guess lets face it the whole story of this movie is patently ridiculous it could not be more unrealistic if there were space aliens involved and yet its still treated here as if we should be taking it as a serious parable of modern life and that it should be used as a way to push really depressing messages across how does a guy who beats people up while in a bat suit teach us about what kind of justice is realistic and effective what does a weirdo in a clown suit teach us about the nature of evil why would anyone be proud that they kept campiness out of this despite the fact that it is a campy movie give me the days of adam west at least his show made me happy rather than depressed negative, the only list this movie should be at the top of is most overrated when i wasnt dozing off i was hoping a fire alarm would evacuate the theater i wont jump on the heath bandwagon because hes six feet under he was average to quote another review if heath gets nominated for an oscar i will never watch another hollywood movie again plot holes the size of the grand canyon overall terrible acting and about 45 minutes of useless fluff at the end had this been the real world the joker would have been caught about 15 minutes into the movie and the credits would have rolled too bad that didnt happen i will not be seeing the next batman in the theater that i can guarantee negative,my husband and i waited hours to see this movie my stepson loves all the old batman series and we do too to finally find a few seats in the third row what a disappointment for 45 minutes we endured bad action scenes with no apparent plot the jokers makeup was cool but we were not impressed with batman his voice was like he was speaking from one of those box things for guys with throat cancer i also wasnt impressed with the technology of the batman suit i guess our expectations were just too high to be fair we may try renting the movie another time and sitting through the whole thing in the distant futurenegative,i dont mean to hurt the feelings of fans of this movie but i simply hated this movie i only understood and was interested in it for about a half an hour then i got extremely bored the movie is extremely confusing and overrated i only got into the action for one scene in this whole movie seriously since people were sad about heath ledgers death they all gave it high ratings in order to get it into the top 250 and #7 man society today has changed drastically go watch the batman movies with michael keaton and batman forever do whatever you can to avoid this trash despite its extremely high undeserved rating 1 10 or fnegative,i meanthis is the best movie everthe number 1is it better than the godfather or braveheart i think not people are talking a lot about heath ledgers performancebut in my opinionjack nicholson was a much better jokerbecause he had a twisted sense of humor and a background that the viewer could relate withthis new joker is just a sick individual with no clear motivation and an absurd point of view shall the academy give an oscar to ledgerwho careseverybody knows who are going to be the winners months before the ceremonyand i wouldnt be surprised if this stupid action flick won best moviebest director and all the other oscars batman should be made for children to see ithow is that possiblethis as an ultra violent movie with batman being a torturer in some scenes some people give the godfather 1 star and this bizarre experience 10what is the world becomingdoes special effects and bizarre characters make a good moviethe best one everonly for the small minded the good old days are overand with this turd on the top of the listimdb looses all the credibilityif the corleones were living in gotham this joker wouldnt last a day uhauhauahauuahuanegative,im giving the dark knight a 1 to lower its overall rating this movie was good but it wasnt great when i think of great movies ive seen this one would definitely not pop into my head first off christian bale is not that great as batman he seems corny and a little to cocky and is nerdy to me actually made the movie worse and what was with the nasally voice what like everybody seeing half of the guys face doesnt give it away but he has to hide his voice second yes heath ledger passed away right after the movie and had the best performance in the movie and is a great actor besides the point but to be honest lets not discredit danny devito what an amazing performance he did as the penguin in batman returns and one of the most underrated actors ever speaking of batman returns i actually love the movie and thought it was allot better than the dark night and i think michael keaton is a much better actor than christian bale and was allot cooler batman the worst performance in the movie was maggie gyllenhaal what a boring dull acting job she put on i dont know if its just her personality but she was not very good and didnt seem like the effort was there and again i thought michele feifer did a much better acting job and was awesome as catwomen all in all this movie was at best a tiny bit above averagenegative, i think that star wars episode v the empire strikes back bis the worst movie i had ever watched although i have only watched it one time i really do not like this movie for several reasons first the movie does not have a proper ending it just stops when all the battles have finished and do not explain any other things after the battle instead it only shows a shot of the characters looking out the window this really disappoints me second about the love between princess leia and han solo i have never thought that leia and han solo are a couple until they suddenly kiss it makes me feel very surprised because the movie does not show any obvious relation between them third the movie does not tell story but showing a battle sequence instead it is very boring for audience to watch finally the battle of luke and darth vader did not bring out a mood of climax but instead it makes me think that it is ridiculous these are the reasons why i dont like this movie negative,i want to be as honest as possible in my review of this film i comment on this movie as i feel outraged that it has been given such a high rating on imdb first my credentials as a fair and impartial reviewer i am a native new zealander my mum new peter jackson well & i quite enjoyed his early films bad tastethe frighteners heavenly creatures & particularly brain dead some of the movie sets were just a few miles from my house and i had the opportunity to work as an extra on the trilogy and all were treated graciously additionally i was a huge fan of tolkiens book and had a sense of excitement and wonder that the lord of the rings was to be made into 3 films in my home country many of the bad reviews posted here compare the book to the movie and the movie will always come off worse and i must admit that when i saw the fellowship i was horrified at how bad and boring it was compared to the book but come two towers i came with an open mind and quite enjoyed the film judging it on its own merits and i had the same plan going into the return of the king additionally i must admit there were a few parts of the return of the king that i thoroughly enjoyed the lighting of the torches the juxtaposition of the brave warrior riding of to almost certain death to please and prove himself to his father while dad casually feasts on grapes supported by a beautiful song the scene where the kingdom bow down to salute the brave hobbits also the brothers acting was fine aannndd thats about it this movie was awful for me first and foremost because it did not draw me in to the story for only seconds at a time did i care for or could i make sense of the story and the acting i was simply bored and restless some of the reasons for this follow the length 3 hours + + peter have you heard about the innovations in film editing and what is with the multiple endings it was like one of those nightmares where you wake up but you are really still in the dream and cant seem to get out i believe a natural ending would have been with the salute to the hobbits frodo oh nodo frodo wore only one expression on his face for the entirety of two towers and the majority of fellowship and return you know that look of pained resignation of sore weariness all those head shots kind of got boring also i just did not buy him turning on his loyal companion sam taking the rascally creatures word over his additionally having struggled so long and hard being so pure of heart for the whole journey you just suddenly decide you want to keep the ring at the last moment cmon sam smithersthe part where frodo sends you away and you start to cry i wish i could erase the pained forced feeling of that scene from my memory warrior woman i cant remember whether it was in the book or not but the ease with which you dispatched an enemy far more powerful than you or just about anyone for that matter seemed a little unlikely it bet daniel sons victory over a vastly superior opponent in kk3 hands down hordes of the undead those ghostly figures aragon summoned um it wasnt too suspenseful for me seeing them do battle since they were invincible and could not be attacked back legolas a shame to see the kick arse archer from fellowship & towers reduced to a one very fake looking scene taking down the baddies on the elephant dwarf i like a dwarf to be ascetic and noble not comic relief aragon why did you change your voice tone and go all james l brooks on us when giving your coronation speech my friend suppressed a laugh karl urban there was an excellent scene in the trailer where you screamed and wailed at the sky below your father the kings body lying dead on the earth that scene really got my heart racing i cant believe it was absent in the movie the battles who was fighting who the editing was such that i couldnt see which characters to root for as the action flied by too quickly and clumsily golem we get that the ring has corrupted your soul and turned you into something horrible over the years we get that you will make a play for the ring before the film is out was the opening scene biography really necessary finally and by far most disgracefully please keep in mind that all three films were filmed at the same time using the same actors production crew and locations the first two movies got just a few oscar nods in minor categories such as sound effects editing how can return of the king be that much better than the other two that it sweeps up 13 or so oscars everything for which it was nominated shame on you academy my guess is that the money from new line cinema was not all spent on making and advertising the film itself bouycott the oscarsnegative, the expectations that were built up by the first film and the second allthough slowed down really plunged down into the lava of mnt doom with this one it really makes you nauseous thinking about everything that is wrong in this film im not talking about the extended version that one is a lot better but still far from perfect and how everything could have been where should i start its overly sentimental i mean really and i like that s usually im a sentimental guy but here its really out of proportion and out of timing oh its really sad when faramir rides to meet the orcs when he has no chance of winning while pippin is singing som silly song like hes castrated and then breaks out and cries just like that bu hu this is a mythological style heroic fantasy tale not titanic everybody are so overly emotional and i dont even wanna talk about sam and his constant speeches about bravery and not giving in with the hand on the chest looking out over the horizon with the orchestra at full volume the only thing missing is the american flag bellowing in slowmotion behind him and frodo and his constant twisting your head like a puppy and looking with big eyes and a oh i love you so much smile at sam every time he saves him or helps him to keep going ok im getting carried away i liked braveheart for example even though it has some major flaws and people think that one is overly sentimental but that one is at least down to earth sentimental rotk is up in the sky almost gone out to space like i thought id never say this but it seems they producers crew and actors really take the film too serious really its a saga not true its a 20th century made up mythology history about an imaginary land its not a record of the holocaust for christs sake i understand how they needed to cut some scenes to save up time but well first of all they didnt succeed enough with that the films are 2 3h long and still it feels youre rushing from one place to the next like youre on a middleearth 8hour safari or cinematic tourbus maybe they shouldve cut it even more so we could at least get the feel of being someplace and not just passing by but whats really unacceptable is when he wastes all that preciously gathered time on exploring uninteresting or unimportant scenes and scenes that dont even belong in the story completely made up scenes for no logical reason the ugly made up bull rhinoceros beasts pulling orc wagons whatta f is up with that i dont even know if george lucas would accept such a badly designed creature in the star wars universe the really awful orc liutenant chief guy whos by the way made up out of thin air who doesnt even look like an orc but more like the aliens from peter jacksons early lowbudget cult films mr jackson this is not the time and place to have cameos or draw funny parallells to your bad taste films thats really bad taste disrespectful to the tolkien fans the m‹Èmaks are really cool but really too big i mean theyre not dinosaurs beasts heyre just big elephants all the small details costumes and armour etc are really beautiful really more than you could ever ask for but the white dwarf miniature esthetics of minas tirith is really bad cause it gives a whole synthetic comic book computer game look to middleearth where are the beautiful classical and authentic designs of edoras and rivendell and no catapult can throw rocks as big as whole houses that too is just corny and childish like in computergames all this and the excessive use and naive belief in cgi technology turns the battle of pelenoor fields which should be the total culmination and action peak of the film into a foney uninteresting starwars warhammer40000 mess its nothing compared to the battle of helms deep and thats not right and this cgi trend seems to be a virus infecting everybody in the film business its really sad these films will be outdated in 10 years but maybe thats a good thing rotk isnt the worst of the three technically but with the expectations you have from the first two the books if you know whats gonna happen the demands should be pretty high and in my opinion too especially after the hint in 2towers that the trilogy was going downhill just like the matrix this is the film that disappoints the most rotk is the greatest and heaviest of the films the first two would completely crumble under its weight if it didnt hold but they could also rise with it if it really grew as strong as it couldve and that is what it should have anything else is unacceptable to me and this is also why i hate it cause it really doesnt live up to its potential it doesnt even outdo the 2towers and it doesnt live up to the old exited expectations you had from the first film i cant understand how a new zeelander who used to make underground films could turn this old british tale into shimmering hollywood cheese its too pretty too pompous and sentimental and all the computer graphics gives it lika a fake sugarcoated shine or crust its like food add too many ingredients and spices and theyll take out each other and the dishll just taste bland its just too much of everything and the whole film falls flat its still stunning but rather tasteless and the only profound experience you might get from it comes soely from the overwhelming magnitude of the whole thing i still wanna congratulate pjackson on successfully bringing this gigantic project home thank him even if hes made me more irritated than delighted cuz im still glad that im able to watch these films he didnt deserve all those oscars but he definitely deserved a few maybe not for directing but for best film for the production but this film should not be ranked as the best fantasy film of all time sebastiannegative,bad bad bad it is such a shame that this movie is so bad it really has the potential to be great but no no no the first two movies were okay but this last one really sucked and yet everybody are joining this mass hysteria over this really really bad movie i just cant understand why a movie with really bad special effects and really bad acting bad directing but a great story can be the winner of 11 oscars the world has truly gone mad and to add it as the second best movie based on votes from users its sad just sad there are tons of movies that are better and this really is the movie that would never end very long ending 30 minutes of fading and ending only to not really end bearf i think people are mistaking the movie for the book sadnegative, a few spoilers below i remember seeing this movie at a theater when it was first released i was very excited and eager to see it as i had heard a lot of positive buzz about it i was very disappointed for many reasons including 1 glorification of violence all the cool characters are cold blooded murderers drug abusers or sadists i cannot identify or become emotionally involved with these type of characters i didnt care if any of the main characters lived or died in fact i would have preferred if they all died in the end because they were all terrible excuses for humans 2 attempting to mix realistic violence with humor in the scene where the guy was accidentally shot in the back seat of the car a few people around me laughed others gasped that someone would laugh i will never forget the guy in the theater sitting behind me saying out loud wait thats funny right isnt that supposed to be funny many action films have cartoonish violence its understood that the violence is farcical this movie seemed to be saying murder and rape are funny and cool 3 the scene with the gimp was way over the top not necessary and sadistic again is this supposed to be amusing and entertaining 4 the dialog seemed to be random and unconnected and without purpose people cite lines about mcroyal with cheese like it is profound is it me am i missing something 5 you have to completely suspend your disbelief at the coincidences that occur a guy is driving on a random street and happens to pull right up next to the guy trying to kill him i am at a loss as to why this movie is rater so high it had some snappy editing and a few genuinely humorous moments but is was a film about nothing but a fictionalized underbelly of society negative, holy smokes this has got to be one of the most pointless trilogies ive ever seen i do not even know how it d this high there was nothing that made it stand out at all throughout the 9 excruciating hours of watching frodo turn into a mentally disoriented fool i cannot recount a single moment in time where i said wow thats interesting first off the plot is simply unenjoyable it has no twist no character building and for gods sake its about a possessive ring watching the characters go through pointless trials to burn a single ring is not something i can find appealing in fact i was ready to watch any of these uptight hobbits meet their end that is a huge problem in this series not one character was tragically killed in the midst of any orc battle ok there was that no name in the fellowship of the ring but the audience didnt give a damn as to what was going on with him what made me even more angry was that these fools looked almost invincible when legolas and gimli were slaying orcs left and right as easily as brushing snowflakes away i was ready to step out of the theater i can see why people liked this movie the action was indeed thrilling and had great deal of special effects thrown into it i remember legolas first arrow being launched smoothly into an orc what a marvelous scene then i looked and he was launching another arrow in a similar fashion then another one and another one sure it looked great but it was so repetitive i got bored every battle in this movie is almost exactly the same swords swinging arrows launching and people screaming i just cant see what was so special about it i also could not get through my head the final battle scene honestly an army of the undead destroying the orc forces gee that must have been a difficult victory it was so predictable and unfair i simply hated this movie for all of the action attempts and turning a really old trilogy into a movie i was considering giving this film two stars but then i remembered the conclusion frodo and sam were being saved by a bunch of hawks or something and everything seemed to be at peace not a bad ending then the story stretches into farewells and goodbyes good luck and god bless ok i can tolerate this now bilbo is going into a boat and heading off to god knows where when is this bloody movie going to end by the time i got out of the theater it was nearly half an hour after the part where the movie would have made an effective conclusion my behind sweating like an oxen from boredom i would definitely not recommend this movie to anyone unless you are amazed by a couple of special effects i dont know how this movie did so well i think one critic said it was a good movie and it spread like wildfire or maybe there was simply nothing else to do but worship elves whatever the reason i do not want to see this ever againnegative, first i thought that the men who stare at goats was bad and than i saw this very bad movie i dont care how many people gave it a 10 dont know why i want to write my opinion it is long boring a lot of talking a lot families names doing buissnes did i mention that it is boring the movie lacks a good storyline it doesnt matter how good the actors are if the movie is not interesting at all there is no comedy there is very little action drama here and there somebody gets killed i had better fun watching politicians than this i just wasted 6 hours of my life together with the second part better watch scarface casino or reservoir dogs my other movies are braveheart gladiator shawshank lethal weapon black hawk down negative,im voting and commenting about this film just to bring it down from its pedestal and invite everyone to do the same i have nothing against italians the mafia or any of the principals but best film ever never it was an entertaining film which displayed some rather ridiculous acting in a gross piece of defamation perpetrated on the italians i have nothing again violence and gore even sex on screen when appropriate but this is a ludicrous consensus your readership has reached and it must be correctednegative,talk about a lousy movie this one was ridiulous i couldnt understand it at all i only watched half of it [the part with bruce willis] and soon as that was over i re wound it talk about a waste of good moneyand why would all the actors in this movie want to be associated with such junk what were they thinking it sure confused the heck out of me thats for sure i cant see what the big deal was with this sorry excuse for a movie it is a waste of film and a waste of the actors times as i see it i would advise someone not to use their hard earned money on this drivel rent something else instead of this turkey negative, perhaps i cant lay all the blame on peter jackson the story was dumb to begin with for those that dont know the idea of the ring originates from platos the republic the ring of gyges basically this ring gives gyges the power of invisibility which he exploits to take over some kingdom and yada yada not a very interesting story on its own but good within the context of the republic glaucon and plato were arguing over the tendency of man to do good over evil and vice versa lotr does not intertwine philosophical explorations with a clever plot instead it merely takes this stupid ring story out of its origin and assumes that is insightful blah this is why i rarely akin to fantasy its authors are prone to employing cheap fiction thanks for making america even dumber peter jackson never make another movie please negative,a very good movie this isbut one sees overtime that pulp fiction may be the most overrated movie of all time tarantino makes movies for teenagers and in the process takes what he does from other great directors and packages it as his own this may be a great movie but no though tarantinos film may have achieved greatness this not the 9th greatest film of all time good tarantino may be but as good as he is he is twice as much a narcissistic arrogant loquaciousbad man what i mean is i wouldnt spend my time with tarantino not so much because i dont like him but because i cant stand the smell of his fans and the rest of his crony balogni phoniesnegative, everyones saying this overrated film is one of the greatest films of all time  nope im saying its groundhog day why because that one is a good film with meaning creativity fun likability and enjoyment unlike this it makes you want to do fun things like it features when watching it watching the godfather i feel no i dont want to do or watch these things most of this film is rather just boring & confusing everything is shot in the dark or with a dark filter you have to make sure youve got something else to do while viewing this masterpiece its way too long and its certainly not flawless  ive spotted a whole bunch of flaws with this flick that theyd have to be put into many notes remember no film is without flaws a summary of the flaws with this film are confusing story lines corrupt characters crime violence some filthy language bad attitudes even the false cult of catholicism being featured rudeness mind aching distressing corrupt plot inconsistencies or scenes that just dont make sense or just annoy the bazzerk out of you i couldnt care less if almost all critics everywhere have given it glowing reviews i dont care if its generally considered a masterpiece and i dont care if it has a 92 out of 10 on imdb i cant believe i fell for such a deceiving look im sad that theyve refused to see how horrible it is the fact is films have quite the tendency to be either underrated or overrated these days seriously this should be turned around all the attention towards the godfather series should be given instead towards groundhog day  all the awards given to the godfather series should be instead towards groundhog day its that good please check it out and plus marlon brandos brought into this flick and given one of the stupidest accents in film history sounding so nauseated and drunk with his chin thrust out so far it makes me think hes turning into jim carrey this films also one of the biggest reasons why i dont care about al pacino as an actor how he almost always seems to have a fetish for hardcore violence swearing and playing all round unromantic unpopular and unlikable characters undoubtedly it was this flick that started a whole film career of mistakes for al pacino i guess hes kind of cool just not as much as people make him to be though to be fair i do give credit to this film for not including one f bomb at all but overall i think this is certainly one of the worser movies i have seen and im glad i didnt watch it growing up 2 10 ps im a movie buff who tries to like every film i seenegative,i am baffled by the users who rate this film so highly if one deleted the n word and the f word there would be no script how can we expect young viewers to treat people respectfully when hollywood bombards us with racial slurs yes life imitates art although calling this movie art is a stretch i read that tarrantino is a high school drop out must be true judging from this script i am certainly no prude or a stranger to adult themes and language however the script was filled with glorified drug use and violence yet failed to show one ounce of character growth the barrage of profanity and violence was both offensive and boring quentin tarrantino movies are on my list of films to avoid waste of timenegative,okay this is a pretty good movie but i just find it hard to see it in the top five thus the low  although it certainly has a lot of great things about it there is a great deal wrong with it as well which i suppose must be expected from a film that is trying to condense 500 pages of literature into over three hours it must first be said that this clearly too long or at least there are points in the film were it does seem to lumber along it also seems that jacksons choice in which parts of the film were to remain in the final cut left out a great deal of interesting stories from the books and the ending is completely different to that of the book and unnecessary that said it is still an incredible achievement overall with excellent battle scenes and amazing effects surrounding an already lovable story but i still wish jackson had made more use of the characters its a great film to watch for sure much better then a lot of the stuff were seeing now but it still could have been a great deal betternegative, after seeing the rating it got on here on imdbcom and hearing from different people who had seen it i was very exited when i saw it was being shown on television it began quite well and some parts were actually good but in after half the movie it got worse and worse freemans role was one of the most irritating marlabo man stereotypical pseudo intellectual characters ive ever had the displeasure of seeing on my television even the green mile was a better movie 3 10 for acceptable actor performances well i really hope one flew over the cuckoos nest will be more interesting else i lost all hope for prison films negative,golly everyone is falling all over themselves about this one why please its silly violent nihilistic pointless and every character has the same way of talking talking about clever things in that pseudo way that only quentin could possibly dream up ooooooh the talent passnegative,regardless of what great actors and actresses were in this movie i found it to be very repulsive the dungeon scene was something that should have been shown on mississippi burning only they had the decency not to go there all in all this movie was difficult to follow and i consider myself an intelligent person violence and filthy language taken to an extreme is how i would characterize this onenegative, there should be two imdb top 250 films one for zombies and another for people with functioning brains who are the dipshts that voted this crap to the #5 on the top 250 films list i tried reading the reviews the positive reviewers couldnt point to any specific reason for liking this film meanwhile the negative reviewers could point to clear and specific reasons for hating this trash i suspect hollywood is trying to turn us into mindless morons this movie was made up of tarantinos brain puke the dialog was clever several times throughout the whole movie the other 98% of the dialog caused me much suffering it was like reading a 10000 page book to find a paragraph of information its not just that the dialog was mind numbingly irrelevant but it was criminally long and served to transport the audience from one aimless scene to the next i think ill write a script about a guy who lost 25 hrs of his life watching a crap movie and then seeks revenge on the writer director ill call it pummel tarantino negative, i was hyped to watch this i thought it would be great but it left a lot of unanswered questions floating in my head more like the whole movie all this movie is about it people snorting drugs getting killed and all the rest of the sucktacularity who are these characters why do they think theyre angels why does quentin cameo in the movie why are there gay cops ive seen death proof and thought it was spectacular i dont know why everyone thinks this is so great the characters have no personality the movie seemed like it left you to make the story full circle some movies do that and achieve it but this one makes me feel to be asking questions rather than answering them bottom line terrible movie 1 10 negative, this flick was about 15 hours too long there was more wasted time and film in this installment and none of it added anything to the production this film certainly did not deserve any of the awards that it received thankfully elijah wood only has about 25 minutes of screen time total for the entire film im so glad this trilogy is over i am also glad that i didnt go see this flick at the theater i would have felt even worse had i spent 9 bucks on a ticket for this extended play boredom fest even at 299 the dvd rental was too much at least i was able to make my own intermissions no film should be this long i cant recommend this flick for anything but an aid for when you cant get to sleep this was a three and a half hour passing of a gall stone shame on the academy for showering this tragic effort with so much gold negative,why are people trying to make this film out to be something it is not this has got to be one of the worst films i have ever seen i mean come on what a load of tripe i could get more enjoyment out of watching the erotic witch project 2 although i have to admit is pretty classy the acting is superb well done girls you really do look and sound like you are cuming there where is all the action the makes a mafia film class like goodfellas marlon brandos acting didnt deserve an oscar it deserved a slap in the face sean connerys performance as a spaniard in highlander was more convincing al pacinos performance is total rubbish the only good part he can do is a queer and thats in dog day afternoon as and for the director paul verhoeven did a better job with showgirls what is wrong with a bit of rape in a film this is the mafia we are watching on the screen if they are going to portray what the mafia are really like then at least show what they do behind closed door very poor 1 out of 10negative,possible spoilers i did have high hopes for this film because its at number one on this chart but after about 40 minutes into it i think its the most boring film i have ever watched in my mind its just a bunch of people talking total nonsense all the time and how on earth marlon brando got a best actor oscar for what seems to be 10 minutes on screen time i will never know the only scene i liked from this movie is in the cafe i think it is when michael kills those two people in order to even the  for his father and to be perfectly honest about 1 hour and 10 minutes into the movie i decided to stop watching it otherwise i would have thrown myself out the window thats how bad this movie is to me i did try to like it but you cant please all of the people all of the time can you and the last thing i want to say is that if this film was so bad i would dive off a cliff rather than see its sequel in my personal opinionnegative,well as all of the tolkiens books are nothing more than some dumb fairy tales any movie based on tolkiens book is gonnawell jay and silent bob fans you know the quotei dont like but i tolerate fanatsy in gerenal but this is by far anyone who likes sitting and watching orcs and goblins speaking single minded lines about some trashcan worth ring for 2 hours are welcome any sane person keep out 0 10negative, people who know and study film will all have the same basic review of this movie its overacted and yes heath ledger is included in that remark and just an overall horrible script the whole why so serious bit was again overacted and so predictable i wrote better dialogue when i was a toddler then comes the completely unfathomable events nolan wanted the movie to be realistic but he clearly is a moron for that statement because only pre teens and people pretending to go along with the hype would believe the whole cell phone bomb inside a guys stomach and a gun in court come one stop insulting me the fact that this movie is anywhere in the top 250 proves that people are generally stupid negative, as far as cinematographic masterpieces this is not one this movie is not in a the same league as movies such as the shawshank redemption or schindlers list it is enjoyable but only the last half the first half plays to be predictable and foolish when i go see a batman movie i want to see an entertaining flick not one trying desperately to be deep heath ledgers joker is a joke he will not win an oscar for this and he shouldnt be nominated any one who has read the comic books knows the joker is not scared because of a knife wound he does not try to mask his appearance with makeup nolans idea of a distraught application is myopic the reason the joker has a more colorful appearance is due to an accident involving acid which bleached his face and colored his hair and lips batman begins is much better and a more entertaining way to spend your time negative, this has got to be one of the worst movies i have seen in a long time the dialog was often difficult to hear especially batman who for some unknown reason seemed to be suffering from laryngitis because of the dark nature of the movie it was often far too dark to see what was happening all which meant that the plot was far more difficult to follow since the days of adam west we have seen several different batmen not least val kilmer and michael keaton to name two who were far better at it than christian bale as for heath ledger i thought his character was so over played that he stole the show so to speak but as for awarding him a posthumous oscar well thats another matter and i personally dont think so negative,i cannot believe someone would call this movie great i would give it a 3 but the fact it is the highest rating movie ever on this site makes me go crazy how pathetic can this be this is the most overrated movie ever created made with a low budget it seems all that happens is a guy that went to prison gets raped several times escapes and meets his friend from prison back when he was out ending 99% of the movie was made in prison where all that happened was he gets raped and washes some clothes seriously how can you even compare this near to godfather dark knight etc and the bad director just killed himself at the end his wife gets killed he isnt even sad about it 20 years in prison has some money not that much and is happy how nicenegative, this film is nothing but one cliche after another having seen many of the 100s of prison films made from the early 30s to the 50s i was able to pull almost every minute of shawcrap from one of those films while it is visually well made and acted the story has every plot point of the standard prison film they have the evil warden innocent main character friendly guilty guy thugs and one good old prisoner dont waste your time on this one rent or buy some of the classics of the prison genre negative, obviously i missed the point of this movie after years of people telling me how fantastic it was and noting how high it regularly comes in opinion polls i finally watched it recently somehow i seem to have come to completely the opposite conclusion to almost everyone else maybe my expectations were too high but i was very very disappointed the plot was predictable and dull the directing pretty droll not much else i can say about it other than to ask people if i have missed something key that would alter my perception of this film who am i to go against the vast popularity of this picture i must be the exception that proves the rule this apparently is a must see movie negative,i really tried to watch this movie i enjoyed the first scene and that was about it after the first scene or so i was so annoyed i could not follow this movie to save my life i was utterly confused and annoyed most of the time i have never in my life seen so much dialog in a batman movie where has batman gone where has the joker gone hands down this was the worse to make matters worse this was the looooooooooooooongest movie i have ever had to sit through the movie was totally boring furthermore i cannot believe that so many people liked this movie it seems that 90% of you loved the movie and 10% of us hated the movie this movie really really really suckednegative,i have never watched a batman film before in fact i have never watched a super hero film before id picked up that this was the best of them so when i saw that it is available on amazon prime instant video i thought id have a look well i have discovered that super hero films are certainly not for me as a child i really loved the batman dc comics and in that animated world for children it works very well however the realisation of the comic character in a more adult context is just totally silly that voice he has sounds like dirty harry only more so and it is just funny the joker seems to be able to construct remarkable situations at a moments notice it is not credible at every turn there seems to be something that has no credibility with the viewer and so you just dont care about what is happening there is no adventure in this film nor are there any particularly clever twists or turns in the plot primarily there seem to be some situations that the joker sets up batmans solutions seem to be boring brute force either with fists or technology in fact i think the dc comic batman was a cleverer and more interesting guy it was quite nice seeing michael caine but i dont think his or anyone elses script was very imaginative boring and silly throughoutnegative,this movie is so damn boring one of if not the worst film ever made give me a real movie with real actors with a producer with real talent these movies made me want to throw up they were so horrible dont waste your 3 hours watching this movie its not worth it theres better ways to spend your time did anyone really believe that green thing that cant even talk it was like that stupid jar jar character they put on star wars now if you want to see a movie with action and adventure with better writing then go watch face off dont waste a minute of your time on this movie please who ever voted and made this movie #3 where it doesnt belong it should be along the lines of worst movie ever i rather watch from justin to kelly a billion times then waste my time watching a movie like thisnegative, im not sure why people think its so great a lot of people talk about this being heath ledgers last movie people not only was he working on another movie that movie had decided to use his footage so when it comes out that will be his last movie do people think it is dark because it is mistakenly believed heath died because of this movie even though it has already been proved to not be true cause ive seen cartoons that are darker theme wise last night i saw an anime on scifi that was more twisted than this movie this movie really wasnt as dark and twisted as they made it out to be and considering most of the violence is suggested rather than seen people cant say this is the most violent movie out there also why did the guy who played batman feel he had to talk as if he had laryngitis or bronchitis or something every time he talked when he was in batman costume people started giggling another problem was that it went on forever it went on and on and on and on i walked out im not sure how much longer there was to the movie but once the joker was caught by batman and you thought it was coming to an end in comes two face with commissioner gordons kidnapped family i had had enough by then the plus sides i like michael caine glad to see him in the movie i have always had a crush on gary oldman the makeup they did on harvey dent aaron eckhart after he became 2 face was brilliant and i liked what they did with the joker to a point but for what it was heath did a good job however i have to give this movie an over all d it was too long too boring too long too hyped and give batman a cough drop for petes sake negative, wow words cannot even describe how incredibly awful this movie was the acting was poor mediocre at best yes that is including heath ledgers supposedly oscar worthy performance as the joker the plot was simply terrible and amazingly uneven as if no one had bothered to make a final edit it is one of the slowest and most boring movies i have ever seen i have never walked out of a movie before but i was highly tempted with this mess checking my watch every few minutes before the one hour mark in what ended up being a two and a half hour movie that seemed oh so much longer i found that the best part of the film was when the credits started rolling whilst michael bays blockbuster movies are terrible at least they are somewhat entertaining sadly i cannot say the same for the dark knight ignore all the hype and dont be fooled by the trailers which suggest this may be a good film this movie was plain terrible a complete train wreck 1 10 negative, i was so looking forward to this movie because i had heard such great things about it disappointed would be a huge understatement what the hell was this movie about as far as i could tell there was no story zero nothing literally nothing happened there was no plot no believable characters not even a single interesting scene or line of dialog to bump this film up to a 2 in my opinion just a total and absolute waste of time making and watching this movie i know movies are subjective but i just do not get how anyone can find this film remotely entertaining in any way there are several films in the top 250 i have seen and agree they should be there this belongs in the bottom 3 along with fargo and american beauty negative, sorry you qt worshippers this film first of all was no reservoir dogs and second of all doesnt have the edge or guts of fight club or american history x for example this is a tour de forced  im so full of my self pant load of a movie calculated hit for the im so full of my self yuppie money punk crowd who think they are hip and cool because they connect with the street analogy pulp fiction is to reservoir dogs as oceans 11 is to the getaway this film is a tarantino ego trip that merits no higher in my humble though strong opinion no higher than a 5 negative,i can not believe that this movie received all the awards that it did it was long slow moving predictable and the acting was terrible i cant believe that they cut out over an hours worth of video to get it down to this length i wish that gandalf would have just given frodo a giant eagle in the first movie so that he could just fly in and drop the ring in the volcano and save us the pain of watching this series i was also worried that there was going to be a love fest between frodo sam and the other hobbits also with all of the computer generated scenes why go all the way to new zealand to film it at least it is all over with nownegative,despite hearing about what a classic this is i hadnt seen this until now all i can say is wow i didnt know how lucky i was before to miss this but now it is too late and i will never get those 3 hrs of my life back the acting is cheesy and the story is so simple and shallow those who thinks there is a deeper meaning must be thinking too hard i suppose a recent comparable movie would be 2012 but at least that had some ridiculous special effects all this had was some really bad acting the best parts were a couple of lol moments during the shooting scenes otherwise this has got to be one of the most boring movies ever and i fell asleep at least 5 timesnegative,dont get me wrong i generally like gory mature movies but this movie was terrible repulsive fast paste griddy storyline with no plot is not my idea of a good movie it was simply a bunch of unpleasant scenes put together sporadically in a timeline sequence until the end of the movie came and you come to realize the moral doing bad things isnt good for you also the most elementary concept one knows the only one that makes it out unscathed is samuel l jacksons part and i believe this is wholly because he abandoned the path of immorality teaching us what is commonly known through a disgusting and unorganized movie nothing at all embracive enthusing funny witty or intelligible i mean their were themes but they were incredibly dull and boarish i am blind to how people see this as a good movie i found this movie as a waste of lifenegative,one of the worst movies i ever seen i didnt see it when it came out i saw it on my 50 inch flat screen hooked up to my stereo all my friends were telling me how good this movie was so i expected a lot heath leger was good cause everybody else was so bad this was one of the most boring batman ever he spoke in that deep voice with no personally all the scenes were dark it would have been nice if a little bit more of the movie was bright my main problem watching this was the sound when they spoke i had to turn to volume way up then when the special effects took place i had to lower it then i had to turn it up again when they spokenegative,the best film thats ever been made thats a lie by my book this film is yes i think ill go as far as to say this bad in many ways where do i start 1 poor acting brando was the only saving grace in this film and the only reason i saw it through to the end the rest of the cast were not good i wanted to tear my eyes out and cut my ears off every time james caan came on screen for instance al pacino was awful too no chemistry in my opinion 2 boring seriously i was on the verge of turning this movie off there were no engaging elements to the film or story 3 it was very cheesy there are no words to describe this aspect justcheese all over 4 an incredibly annoying  ive read comments calling the  a classic i dont find a  that consists of bringing in the same high pitched melody in over and over again classic all in all what are the people of the world thinking ranking this movie so high 1 10 purely because of brando scorsese does it a million times better negative,in my opinion a good movie is one that makes you feel diffrent when you leave the theater or puts a feeling on you that you havent experienced you have a true feeling that you got just by watching somthing i also ask what makes and entertaining movie to me its one that you just cant get enough of you can watch over and over again and it never gets oldnegative, everyone raves about the godfather and its achievements i say its all a matter of opinion the performances are probably what makes this film a work of art itd be nearly impossible to find another film where diane keaton al pacino marlon brando james caan and the rest of the cast do work of such quality even in the sequel they begin to slack off with the exception of keaton and pacino what this movie also benefits from is the power of the story but there are moments where the overall mood becomes oppressive and a bit too slow the film is a joy to behold with an evocative  sensational photography and many other great elements would i put it up there at the top of the heap there are other films that are more consistent whose elements work well as a solid unit and deliver more satisfactory results negative,i cant believe this movie got so high ratings have you all lost your minds this is one of the dumbest movies i have ever seen and im not talking batmans kicks being more than match for bullets this is a comic based movie suspension of disbelief is due with regard to things like that or cops cooperating with batman cops dont like sharing any power and neither does the govt apparatus which would rather have joker murder a hundred of civilians than let one vigilante like batman go free where suspension of disbelief is not due are the movies messages that it dumps in truckloads on viewers heads aw the poor corrupted cop who did this because of her mothers hospital bills aw hear ye the socialized medicine is needed aw aw we do spying on people where necessary but its still wrong aw aw we never kill villains even when they wrong do us aw aw the prisoners are at heart good people we just should re socialize them more aw the scene that topped all the other in hypocrisy and idiocy was when one of the prisoners has thrown the detonator for the civilian boat through the window in real life hed be pushing the button in a second this is where the movie gets it all wrong or perhaps it lies to us but in such way that we should notice after all at the end of the movie we are lectured that some things are more important than the truth like having a hero with bad taste in women speaking of which you dont really believe that brucey and harvey would swoon all over the mediocre looking rachel in real real world the two would rather be jointly gang banging the russian ballerina which was a stunner than trying to get rachels affection who in turn had a misfortune of a scriptwriter getting her spout the mandatory post feminist line oh bruce dont make me any chance blah blah but lets put this aside and come back to make believe real world strangely in this movie the only character with an ounce of sanity was joker he just did not let that sanity get in his way have you noticed this he was the only character that the scriptwriters let tell the truth how things were in his view everyone else was a puppet with mind tied up by shallow politically correct slogans so even here the movie got it wrong the joker was sane just evil all in all this was not the epic battle between good and evil but between dumb and evil perhaps that is why this movie was after all so boring the characters are shadows of their former selves from previous batman movies this is a version disinfected from everything that has mental life like in one south park episode where the directors digitally replaced all the guns with walkie talkies in their movies this movie has had that kind of surgery applied to it at the scriptwriting stage the result is a neutered cat instead of a tiger tragedies portrayed in it are fake we feel that characters portrayed in it do not feel what they exhibit but exhibit what they feel they should have been exhibiting because they feel watched all the time one of reasons the movie is not believable is precisely because good guys do not pull the trigger the good guys are pc pussies with lawsuits worrying them more than bullets the dumb ideology and yes politicized world view emerges even in selection of the main hero a lawyer lawyer as a hero puhlease everyone is a walkie talkie for some false line you get the idea this is a movie staffed with mannequins instead of characters i had a gnawing suspicion somewhere at the back of the head when i was watching the movie that all of it was result of cold calculation that it was all just designed to pull emotional strings of naivet‹©s with whatever calls once to never kill a villain then to tax funded health care is good thing then whatnot this movie does not believe in itself why should i believe in it then and dont tell me its just a movie yes its just a movie just an exceptionally dumb one negative,why the dark knight sucks it is basically akin to triumph of the will pure propaganda batman = george w bush or any shady uber rich government official as bruce wayne he must portray himself as a spoiled bumbling fool who boozes and womanizes and is just a big walking joke as batman he can use any kind of destructive method to take down the bad guy in this case the joker is often called a terrorist including using billions of dollars of wayne enterprises money to secretly implant 3d sonar imaging devices into a wave of new cell phones that flood the market and consequently give him the ability to create a 3d map of the city that can locate and track anyone his closest friends who know his secret identity think this tracking map is unethical but he justifies it by saying that he must use any means necessary to take this one down does any of this sound familiar besides all of this the movie feels like that 15 minute montage of super heroic feats from every first superhero movie sssssssssttttttttttrrrrrrrreeeeeeettttttccccchhhhhheeeeedddddd ooooouuuuuutttttt to 2 1 2 hours it starts out too talky with a bunch of mob bosses among them eric roberts wriggling out from under da harvey dent aaron eckhart in court and throws a few unnecessary story lines up in the air that dont get resolved until much later and poorly at that then strings together action set pieces that all seem like leftovers from a die hard movie for the next 2 hours then finally wraps it up with characteristically cheesy the fight will continue dialogue that every superhero movie ends with so its boring plus its poorly done apart from that save your money negative, i am not a comic book reading loser or a fanatic of the batman films however i did think batman begins was somewhat entertaining so stupidly i believed that since this film had made so much money in so few days there had to be something to it well there wasnt this is a boring slow cheaply made movie the entire budget seems to have gone into making the batmobile motorcycle some explosions and not much else the city of gotham is clearly chicago there wasnt even an attempt to make it look any different one can actually see the word chicago on one of the buildings during a scene as for the acting batmans costume looked cool and no acting was really required by him the joker character was ok but his voice was really gay and whats with the guy with the eye liner i think he was supposed to be the mayor was he gay too he should have gotten together with the joker the worst of the group was the ugly woman who played rachel the slut that led batman on while dating that irritating harvey dent she was so hideous i had a hard time looking at the screen seriously is there a shortage of actresses in hollywood what fool cast this creature this movie is about three hours long it seemed like ten and for most of the time nothing happens people were suckered into this crap by the hype and the marketing one could sense the disappointment in the crowd when it was over ive never seen so many looking at their cell phones during a movie people paid to be entertained and got a long slow stupid boring mean spirited disgusting ass numbing piece of crap the dark night sucks negative,ridiculously overrated monumentally disappointing whoa imdb wont let me post this its too short obviously well then let me tell you this i never cared for the re franchising of batman its just more of the hollywood style money making and the more money they put into a film and its promotion the more hype they create but it sadly isnt just about them wanting us all to go see the movie no they get really greedy and after a certain point is reached they proclaim this same movie is a piece of art its that simple and if you can succeed in believing it is it makes your life easier and jollier you go to imdbcom you give it a 10 you read some exuberantly positive comments and smile contentedly you read some unfavourable ones and mutter to yourself that there are always idiots who just dont get it and youre happy cause millions of people are desperately trying to prove to each other that they are part of something bigger than life and are succeeding in that endeavour and you are one of them not me guys not me i like a lot of stupid films but not this one it makes me sick for it reminds me how gullible we all are and just how much we want to dream but we only want the dreams to come on the big screen this is one of the many possible ways kindly provided by our great benefactors we can spend our ugly dollars on something shiny and new and inspiring and harmless and easy to digest so be happy eat your popcorn feel nice eat well after the movie sleep tight dream beautifully but dont bother trying to wake up cause we are all in a really comfortable place and waking up will be very painful on the other hand the dream factory could keep you contented by offering you another piece of art for 10$ or thereabouts kudos to our benefactors and encorenegative,this is the biggest ridicule after george w not being able to spell the word nuclear right it is simply beyond my understanding how hundreds of thousands of people could have rated this film even worthy of attention batman the dark knight is a piece of cake with capital letters ok a huge fat turkey of a movie is not a new kid on the block but no piece of trash has ever been so over rated as this one is i know that heath ledgers death came unexpected and the guy was a solid actor but you cannot praise something to the skies out of commiseration and loyalty cause however hard i am trying i am not able to find any other substantial reason why you would give christopher nolans new embarrassment of an action flick six seven eight or nine points let alone ten this movie is lacking a consequent plot a cohesion of the myriad of action scenes it has been broken down into and a common sense to know when enough is enough besides i really dont know which film those who said the acting was brilliant had watched but what i see is that christian bale maggie gyllenhal and gary oldman all lack conviction and had the end of the day and probably the collection of money in mind when they stood in position in front of the blue screen oh and quite often i really got confused from time to time i needed to be reminded i was not watching the new james bond movie or terminator cxxxviii the gadget scene the plane escape scene are truly pathetic as is the concept of reintroducing the character of two face the guy who did not read the instructions manual of the microwave oven since we are talking about a comic book adaptation i dont bother to mention how unrealistic action sequences are try wiring a town hospital with all that security and cctv cameras they got installed or try buying unnoticed the oil reserves of a medium sized country to blow half of the city into the sky but let me ask why nobody out of the immense crew that put this film together could pay attention to small details like when police forces storm the hong kong building to catch the bat suit guy arigato arigato they wave each other up the stairs does this mean china needs to hire law enforcement personnel from japan ok i am stopping there i know i might already have made some enemies among comic book and action film lovers this forgettable encounter with batman however reminds me again i am not one of themnegative, this is not really a review of the movie you can find plenty of those this is just my rant about the reviews of the movie as of the time of this writing the dark knight is ranked as the number 1 movie of all times on imdb are you freaking kidding me really better than the godfather better than pulp fiction raiders of the lost ark the usual suspects if you think this is true than you are one of the following a a moron b have not grown any pubic hair yet c are employed by the production company in order to create false hype about an overall average movie and to exploit the tragic death of a brilliant young actor whose performance in this particular film was only average for the purposes of making a profit vote 1 out of 10 this rating system is bull negative, i rated this movie 1 10 cause its rated 89 10 the film was boringruined 2 hours and lead to my 1st imdb comment the whole story revolves on 3 incident and they go like joker strikes batman saves again joker strikes batman saves and judging by the fact that it was rated 85 when i watched this movie i was expecting kick ass t2 and all i got was a 2 facemy fav in the anime series who is portrayed by a dumb ass who lacks any kind of style whatsoever and looks like sh1t even before he burned his face a reasonable rating for this film would be a 75 10look for the movies it beat in top 100 list and surely doesnt belong there and when youve watched ityoull come back writing one comment of your own peace negative,i feel like im in the twilight zone is this what passes for movies now since you are reading comments stroll by the voter demographics highest ratings are in the youngest age group thats not to say all young people are voting 10 10 thank goodness some are smart enough to have seen older movies and cant believe the insane over hype but too many just werent around for the good stuff before overuse of cgi or back when there was actually a plot the characters were developed or there were plausible reasons for things do people honestly think this is perfect will it be remembered as a classic 10 20 30 40 years from now no the more i think about it the more irritating it becomes in the grand scheme of things who the hell cares what movies it beats out because those classics did survive decades upon decades and this is just temporary infatuation what gets on my nerves is that movies were doing so well for so long people cared about making quality entertainment for the most part its hard to put my finger on it because i kept dozing off during the movie but the dark knight is really flawed and to think that with this undo attention that this will set the new trend trend for how movies are made is agonizing to anyone that lives for movies thanks a lot nolan i think now ill take up drinking as a hobbynegative,it is inconceivable that this movie is anywhere near the top 250 it is 25 hours of a coarse voice explosions cheap one liners and terrible plot batman begins i thought was brilliant it had genuine pathos its characters were very believable and had depth to them the acting was phenomenal but this piece of crap is completely the opposite i have seen spaghetti westerns and childrens cartoons with better acting then the dark knight with the exception of the joker by ledger who was decent there is no screenplay there are explosions i think michael bay actually produced and directed this there is a random side plot to hong kong that had no purpose or place in the story the cell phone tracking technology is the dumbest and most far fetched thing i have ever seen in a film the only reason this movie gets any recognition or praise is because of ledgers death that plus the batman and joker fanboys that flood imdb to give this crap a 10 they like how cool joker was and sided with him and they feel bad for ledger a + b = in top 10 of imdb this movie is completely forgettable and deserves no awards and none of your time it does deserve to be an example of a horrendously written poorly shot poorly lit pathetic excuse of a movienegative,a nihilistic style piece where all the exceptional creative and artistic talents are wasted in enhancing humanities most negative emotions the movie may be well made but as a piece of fiction it fails to justify its existence it identifies and taps humanities core emotions but does not understand how they operate and thus cannot raise their level scaring people is easy but understanding the purpose of fear and how it transforms into courage and clarity is to understand the true nature of heroism and what really inspires humans this film lacks any understanding of how good people have actually been able to defeat tyranny by turning the fear around there is an exceptional opportunity for creating genuine hope from the storys premise but it is lost in part because i dont believe the director knows how to find it finally the actor playing the joker appeared to show at least two of the strongest indicators of a vulnerability to develop mental illness it may not have been wise to have such an individual play this kind of character i honestly would not recommend this movie to anyonenegative,simply the worst i was hoping for some good moviehell i fought itll be great my brother saw it first and said it was good sh it than it was my turn i remember when i was already going out from cinema ive wished i could punch twice nolan in his face batman is my fave comic herobut its not important right now whats important is that god damn nolan gave us piece of max commercial movie for little kids its not realistic as nolan said it would be and its not dark either i shouldve known that the dark knight will be the same sh it as bat beginsbut it doesnt help for my frustration i wish burton could make few more bat movieshis dark vision of gotham was incredible art deco with style and fashion of 50s combine with present timeok with late 80sand jack as the jokeri think it was a role of his lifeh ledger was good but he didnt beat jack the king but he was really goodshame that ledger was the only one who knew what he was doingand in the endjoker didnt save the dayand the dark guano is one of the worst movies ive ever seen 1 of 10 is more than it deserves im not from the great us of aor england so if my comment seems a little shi tty give me a brake post scriptum bale was totally without balls in this movie i like him but‰Û_but im telling what ive seen but what totally destroyed the movie were giant holes in plot and this incredible stupid device that converts mobile phone in allah god buddha confucius knows what ps2 i must tell this‰Û_do any of you believes that prisoners on one of those boats loaded with explosives wouldnt have blown to high sky that other boat and the same about those good citizens‰Û_negative,one of the worst films i have ever seen i nearly fell asleep during the movie due to lack of a compelling story a big budget film at its worst that was hyped beyond measure due to the appearance of a certain actor yes some of the special affects and costumes are excellent like they are in all batman movies the car was embarrassingly poor however and christian bales acting was non existent whos voice was simply peculiar hands down worst batman to date well done hollywood hype machine for scoring another hit with a useless film i have great respect with how much money they have made with so so so little how this film has won oscars is a myth and probably just a sympathy vote including the high rating on this website avoid like the plaguenegative, boring unexciting tedious overlong and uninterestingonly a few choice words i can think of off hand to describe this total and utter let down of a film that everyone else seems to be raving about what a load of absolute rubbish it was a total waste of time from start to finish i had originally decided not to see this film having not overly enjoyed batman begins but gave in in the end due to all the hype and the fact that it had soared to the no 1 spot in the imdb database i was absolutely shocked and amazed by this how it can go ahead of such brilliant films as shawshank redemption and star wars ill never know not to mention the masterpiece of lord of the rings i see tdk is currently in the no 3 position all i can say is that i only hope it continues to drop places to put things in perspective i wish i hadnt of bothered with tdkwithin ten minutes i was sitting there in the cinema yawning my head off for one thing i had difficulty understanding many of the sentences the characters were saying and for another the whole film just didnt hold my attention i thought christian bale was boring and wooden in his role of batman with that silly voice when hes in the suit to match morgan freeman and michael caine were fine as always but utterly underused if their is one shred of goodness in this film through my eyes it would be for heath ledger as the joker his untimely death shortly after the making of this film did ill admit help spur me on to see tdk and after all the hype put out for his performance he certainly didnt disappoint he truly stole every scene he was in and so deserves every credit he gets he was a great young actor who will be sadly missed i just cant believe how so many people love this film so much what is the matter with all of you no disrespect to any other imdb reader writer of course everyone is entitled to their opinion but mine is one star for this film and one star only tdk was the worst film of the summer for me wall e was better by far at least that film had bags of imagination character development and story this had nothing even the action sequences were uninteresting and flat it was so overlong too that after a while i was silently shouting at the screen  come on get on with it i will never see another batman film again in the cinema i dont care what level the hype meter goes to i knew this would be crap and it was by the way in case your wondering my one star rating is for heath ledgers performance and for it alone negative,i must be the odd one out i saw this movie with my son both of us found the movie very bad bad story line very bad action only reasonable acting was heath ledger as the joker yes there is action lots of action but the action is action for the action it hard to see a story line the story is also very over the top i know it is a kind of sf movie but unlike starwars the action and gadgets are totally exaggerated i liked the other batman movies better so overall a wast of money it was hard not to fall asleep negative,i decided to watch this trilogy with a completely open mind to see what the fuss was all about i was rather embarrassed by the fact that i had never seen any of these movies which were heralded as great cinematic classics instead of the masterpiece i was promised however i was left with a great mediocrity the characters were barely 2 dimensional the plot was riddled with holes and horribly rushed and the dialogue was cheesy episode v was perhaps the least painful to watch but still isnt close to being good i dont know if its a case of a movie aging very badly but i cant for the life of me understand the allure of it to each their own i guessnegative, moves even further from the source material more so than the two towers by peter jackson and fran walsh too many elements are changed from the heart of tolkiens work sam would never have been turned away and by the way just how did he find that sword and the light of elendil in shelobs lair with no light source also shelob is spider like but not a spider there were no webs in her lair even worse is the acting of john noble as denethor yes denethor has despaired but int he movie his madness is related to his use of a palantir and competing against sauron saurons will was stronger and he bent denethor left him bereft of hope this movie he is a caricature a cheap poorly rendered badly overacted caricature faramirs character was assassinated in the second movie but it is his father who is torn asunder even worse in this one aragorn had the sword anduril after he left elrond and rivendell and says so in the the two towers before entering the hall to meet with wormtongue and theodenbook here it is given to him by elrond who never came to visit aragorn it was elronds sons and the remaining rangerswho allude to no longer protecting the borders of the shire foreshadowing the scouring and they brought the banner of the king not the sword aragorn acts like a haughty king in the paths of the dead where in the book the scenario is much more dramatic and better also the dead were released before the battle at pellenor fields after helping them capture the ships with black sails that scene looked like the frighteners part 2 absolutely ridiculous it is a pretty to look at movie with no substance when compared to the source material tolkien loved the scouring of the shire and felt it was the true climax of the entire work yet peter jackson called it a simple denouement and said he hated it the better story isnt in these movies and i hope that people can read with a finer eye than they watch these movies with they arent that good and each slips further down the first adaptation was the best of the three and this was the worst hands down negative,first i am a huge fan of the lotr series by tolkien it is one of the most richly detailed and wonderfully written stories of all time and it pains me to see the dreck that peter jackson has produced i didnt mind the fellowship of the ring i thought it was definitely the most concise and well directed of the three films also the visual aesthetics of the films are excellent the set design and choice of locale is impeccable and i applaud the people involved for their dedication to recreating the surreal wonderful world of tolkien on screen however it is the technical aspect of the project what should be the real beef of the film that puts the knife in the two towers marked the real beginning of jacksons self righteous altering of tolkiens noble story and left many fans and serious film goers wondering what went wrong but return of the king takes the cake for what could very possibly be the worst adaptation of a novel in film history jackson changes large portions of the plot of the novel for no apparent purpose even friends of mine who had not read the book asked me why certain scenes resolved the way they did the character development is excruciating as some of the major character based events from the book seem rushed and inconsequential in the context of the film jackson has done a great job at remembering the characters names and their titles but has drawn a blank on their behavior values emotions and relationships with other characters the script is pathetic tolkiens majestic storytelling and tasteful use of pathos and emotional turmoil is replaced by long winded sappy clich‹© monologues complete with the exact same musical  used for the previous two films entire scenes are based around petty arguments and melodramatic emotional breakdowns and filler dialog is rampant it seems that jackson did this simply to keep the 3 hour running time the action sequences are grandiose and somewhat true in objective form to tolkiens telling of them but jackson employs cinematography that is on par with a nickelodeon miniseries using cheap close ups and nauseatingly swirling camera angles that leave the viewer feeling more confused than involved in the action jackson throws in some cheap action film comic relief during the battles giving the viewer the impression that the characters are not fighting for their lives but rather swashbuckling for swashbucklings sake very simply this is not the lord of the rings that i grew to love years ago when i read tolkiens masterpiece i am a supporter of artistic freedom in the adaptation process ie kubrick coppola but not when the adapter simply has no artistic ability in his craft jackson genius behind such film classics as the frighteners and dead alive this film does not belong in the top 250 nor do the other lotr films knowing that this film is above seven samurai and casablanca and that the first two lotr films are the reason citizen kane sits at #11 sickens menegative,the difference between art that comes out of the studio system and art that comes out of a lifetime if only we could develop a moving image pillar that was not driven by base profit we might see an expression of tolkien on film that was decent the fall this is the beginning of the end for our civilization when art is so corrupted that people can no longer even tell the difference our way of life is over anthropologist alien or otherwise will mark the success of these films and of george bush and of television as the harried and quickened end of the west not unlike the fall of numenornot that you would know anything about that from these adaptations what a disgrace how dare jackson call this tolkien negative, i think that there is a herd mentality about this film because tarantino cultists liked it people say things like the best film of the 90s people seem to think that they are not cool unless they loved pulp fiction maybe i just dont get it but what is so great about it its circular big deal the entire film is pointless and i really dont care about any of the characters the violence is gratuitous i am not squeamish i have watched and i have to admit enjoyed romeros dead films it is supposedly funny when the kid gets shot in head and his brain is splattered all over the inside of the car yep that is hilarious the only good thing about the film is that john travolta is in it negative,i have seen many movies in my time a lot of bad movies and a lot of good movies i like movies from all genres this is easily one of the worst movies i have ever seen i cannot comprehend why this movie is considered good an overacted badly directed self important repetitive uninspired shallow video game of a movie not a single character of depth ok smigle slighty what was the point no imagination in the directing acting set and art design slow motion oy am i sick of slow motion now that was creative editing whats with the ending that was a 30 minute goodbye get on the boat already die already die die die die die how long does it take to die gandalf all powerful wizard nine hours of movie and all he can do is shine a light in the dragons eyes ooooh scary light not recommended for anyone and those who liked it are wrongwrongnegative,however the real acting triumph of the film is elijah wood as frodo baggins he continues his descent into corruption with an incredible talent that many could not pull off woods performance is so critical to the film because it determines the rings power to corrupt which needless to say is absolute the first two films established jackson as an incredible visionary shooting vast landscapes from his native new zealand with return of the king jackson really gets a chance to show off with hands down the most beautiful visuals of the trilogy jackson makes return of the king a gorgeous feast for the eyes while never resorting to mcg level over the topless jackson stays very grounded in his characters not letting the effects tell the story but only assist the wonderful dialog and characters think of return as a mix of fellowship and two towers with enough action and character development worthy of ending a film event of this magnitude the bottom line fans of the films will not be disappointed hardcore tolkien lovers might be upset by plot changes and interpretations made by jackson and the other writers however it is unrealistic to expect a completely true adaptation of the novels being that film is an entirely different medium despite the alterations jackson consistently stays true to the major themes and ideas from the original text while adding some of the finest film making ever put to screen the lord of the rings the return of the king is one of the most finely tuned and cinematically perfect films ever made not only the best of the trilogy but a crowning achievement in epic film makingnegative,i personally believe that although the godfather got rave reviews and is generally thought of as the best movie of all time i didnt care for it the truth of the matter is that the epic saga insists upon itself it was predictable it was depressing without anything really to be depressed about and lastly the dancing elves were really quite over the top and unnecessary it was arrogant pompous and there was really no plot it was the worst movie i ever saw it should have taken a lesson from the movie teenage mutant ninja turtles which was by the way the best movie of all time it was atrocious also what was the deal with the birthday party scene in which al pachino gets plastered on moonshine with barbara bush or maybe it was paula dean i cant remember which one i get the two confused to even compare this to movies such as the pink panther and the wiz is atrocious both of those movies were brilliant compared to this high budget slouch even marlin brandos benign performance is not enough to bring this movie up to a two star ratingnegative,let me just start by saying that i am 50% italian i have nothing against mafia movies in fact i have nothing against any type of movie but to say that this is the best movie of all time is simply insane i saw absolutely nothing special i kind of enjoyed the performances of al pacino marlon brando and james caan but besides that there is not one really exceptional feature in sight and the fact that it is one hour too long only brought down my enjoyment its not the worst film of all time but not the best eithernegative, i must be one of the few individuals on this planet that totally detested this film i left the cinema feeling extremely ill i went along to this film on the recommendation that it was highly amusing but i guess their idea of humour isnt quite the same as mine sure it had some clever moments but why belabour the point negative,this movie is a painsimply horrible boring too long bad acting bad writingpratically i don t save nothing of this pile of garbagethe fake looking special effects are some of the worst i have ever seenthe sad thing is that this overrated turkey won so many oscar quite a testament of the low level of the academy awardsterriblethe editing is a complete mess the only saving grace are the wonderful new zealnd landscapeshow many ending it had 10 20 come on its simply laughablein conclusion a very bad and overrated movieanother thing this movie is number 3 of all the time imdb webmaster its time to change the imdb vote modalitiesnegative,this is quite possibly the worst movie ever made not funny just stupid worse than bill and teds bogus journey worse than anything ever except maybe natural born killers they both were horrid i can not believe that anyone could enjoy this movie i guess if i were on crack it might be mildly funny but i doubt it i was expecting much more for the acting considering that there are some good actors in it they must have decided to see how bad they could make something and still get people to watch it there is no other logical explanation for why they would be a part of such a stupid movienegative, i read the godfather novel it was one of the best books that i have ever read not one minute in the story was i not entertained or interested i was very excited to see how frances ford coppolas collaboration with mario puzo the author of the book would translate this into a movie when watching the movie i tried to put all of my memory of the book into the back of my head and try to enjoy the movie but sadly the movie was just not entertaining as a movie by itself yes the cast is one of the best ever assembled marlon brando al pacino robert duval etc but all of the main events that should be entertaining like the elimination of all the bosses in the end or the murder of sunny corleone at the toll both but sadly they just bore you to the point were you want even marlon brando to die which he later does even the performances from the actors themselves especially marlon brando leave much to be desired from these awesome actors this is without a doubt the most overrated movie of all time if you want to see the life of a mobster done right see scorceses casino and goddfellas these do not only show the life of a mobster but they are also entertaining with awesome acting from robert de niro and joe pesci every time i give this movie 2 10 thats because mario puzo was involved negative, overrated is an understatement this movie is start to finish garbage i though reservoir dogs was an ok movie and i liked inglourious basterds a lot i dont have a problem with violent or perverse content in movies my all time favorite is david finchers fight club but this movie is just crap i understand the nostalgic aura about how this movie revolutionized what was acceptable to do in movies but that doesnt make it a good movie by any means the acting as a whole was entirely sub par as usual samuel l jacksons acting is consistent with the career he has built on shouting a la snakes on a plane and contributed nothing positive to the movie same goes for john travolta whose acting was arguably worse than jacksons theres a significant unconvincing memorization tone to his lines the only reason this is considered to have resurrected his career is because he was in the movie at all once the movie became a cult classic he became the marketable actor he once was i already said i dont have a problem with movies that contain explicit language but in pulp fiction there are certain instances where too many expletives are inserted and im not sure for what effect if you listen to tarentinos lines as jimmy and jacksons lines when theyre cleaning out the car i think these lines best exemplify the overkill im talking about another thing about the movie is it is generally not relatable i realize this seems like not a legitimate complaint after all how marketable would a movie really be if it was wholly relatable however i just felt like the over glorification heroin use among other aspects really turned me off also usually movies that glorify or portray behavior lifestyles similar to those depicted in pulp fiction have characters that are normal human beings in this movie every character is either a murderer a gangster a drug dealer someone with a drug problem an accomplice to a crime or a rapist i just dont see the redeeming social value here if you like movies with quality acting character development any sort of plot or a message that doesnt bash the bible chances are pulp fiction is not for you the one thing that tarentino got right was the title pulp fiction this movie is both cheaply produced art and fake negative,its an okay film epic and all of course the fact that its an epic like gladiator or troy doesnt mean its good troy proved that fact and alexander continued to prove it with one star antics to be quite frank peter jackson is an overrated director much like the lord of the rings movies are overrated movies if you notice all three are located in the top fifteen films this one happens to be ranked higher than greatly superiour films such as seven samurai schindlers list and even casablanca this is not the case with camera angles that make you sick utilising the admittedly beautiful landscape of new zealand to help push across into our heads the true epic feeling of middle earth but wait where are the interesting characters every one of them you feel so bored with by the time the first film is up you seem to hope that theyd be dead by the second one but no they come along to the third one to kick some sauron ass heres my view of lord of the rings a whole load of walking lord of the rings fellowship of the ring points there walks lord of the rings the two towers points there walks trips up walks on lord of the rings return of the king points there walks throws ring into mountain walks away take those completely identical scenarios and pile them up with useless plot for three to four hours per movie depending on which one you watch and i myself wouldnt touch the extended versions you really get the idea that the academy awards truly are flawed why look forrest gump won best film of 1994 instead of the shawshank redemption or pulp fiction titanic won best film of 1997 instead of la confidential and why lookey here lotr rotk won best ing film of 2003 instead of mystic river perhaps next year well have the constant gardener as the best film of 2005 that may actually redeem the oscars failing reputation a reputation that had truly fallen when they took this half arsed effort of a movie and worshipped it as best film negative, really now i cant say that this is the worst movie of all time but it certainly isnt the greatest the mere fact that tbs plays this movie sixteen times per week thereby forcing you to watch it over and over again does not mean that it is good i therefore call for a surge of negative reviews to be leveled against this mediocre film so that with the help of mark twain and his angels we will be able to oust it from its ill deserved spot as imdb #1 movie of all time honestly my fellow americans this film is the kind of thing that makes us look bad merry christmas and to all a good night
